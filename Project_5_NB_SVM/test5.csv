6088,0,I didn't care for this one very much. The zombies weren't very scary and the whole thing just kind of fell into a rut.
4107,1,"This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
10762,1,"This is a game everyone should play, great storyline, great graphics, and REALLY fun! I am proud to own the game and I reccommend it to about everyone!"
10462,1,have nothing negative to say about this product. Very please!delicious satisfying I use these every day and I have no problems with any leakage from the product. Thanks for such a marvelous product.
14813,1,"I have never read a book anything like this before. Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars."

7457,0,"not as great as i thought. brought it because it was costing me $10 per tube. have been applying it for about 3 weeks now and saw little difference. you have to keep reapplying the gel to get some type of a result. i had used other products just once for about 6 months and they had worked much better - buy the more expensive stuff (maxforce or advion), dont go for their price!"
18162,0,"It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously."
4424,1,"This excellent book captures a society unlike any other. In this world, books are outlawed. If you are caught with them, you are jailed and the books are burned. Guy Montag, who is the protaginist of the story, is a firefighter. However, instead of putting out fires, he starts them. He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything. This winds up getting him in trouble. However, in the end this works out for the best. We definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to burn their brain. For under six bucks, you can get a great thriller."
10047,1,"I've had this case for close to a year now and had no problems with it up until 2 months ago when I noticed one of the plastic hinges that attaches the Palm to the case snapped off, the remaining intact hinge has held up for about 2 months so far. The clasp has been fine and holds the case firmly shut, great access to all buttons and slots. I would have given it 5 stars but the hinge broke."
5208,1,"This self-titled effort from the British band offers their masterful harmonies on an eleven track album.The trio of Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester share most of the compositions, with the exception of the album's biggest hit, THE AIR THAT I BREATHE, written by Albert Hammond.The only real misstep is the obvious LONG COOL WOMAN clone, THE DAY CURLY BILLY SHOT DOWN CRAZY SAM MCGEE, which even copies LCW's opening guitar riff. However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN. Ballad-wise, DON'T LET ME DOWN is sharp and the 50ish doo-wop sound of LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND is a nice change of pace.Overall, an enjoyableslice of 70s pop."
17881,1,"CodeTracker tells me: a) where unknown callers are calling from (using table on back plus caller ID), and b) what time zone callers are situated in (useful when returning messages), and c) it takes the hassle out of splits, overlays, new codes and changes. The table on the back is quick and has all the changes explained clearly, and the maps are useful. Yes, you're right! I like it. I bought a pack and put one on every desk in the office. I reckon I got my money back on time saved within a couple of weeks."
15951,0,I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory. I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go. Wouldn't work in two other systems I tried. The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems. Mine is going back.
7800,0,"The basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical (or pre-historical?) fiction. However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal ""mind meld"" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."
15312,1,"Because of its extensive bibliography and excellent index, this biography of William Procter, Jr., serves well as an introduction to the origins of professional pharmacy in the USA.For more information about the book and its topic, contact the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy (AIHP)."
13550,0,"I kept reading past the midpoint of the book, hoping that this was not going to be another liberal-inspired jab at the Catholic church. But, as the end wore on, sure enough all of the liberal jargon found its way in to the final chapters, pro-choice, homosexuality is OK, female priests, married priests. This is suppose to be a novel, but I hate to see an author play fast and loose with factual history to satisfy a political motive. This book is a waste of time. My first Steve Berry read, and my last."
7297,1,"This is an example of absolute perfect filmaking. If you read the book, you will know what I mean. It is probably the most true-to-the-original screenplay ever written.Slowly building on on how the everyday things we hear and see can turn into our worst fears, this film spells horror in it's most realistic form ....plain old paranoia. Or is it?""This is no dream; this is really happening!""Watch it over and over again for the view of NYC mid-sixties ... the bright cheerful whites and yellows everywhere... Christmas in the city ... and wow, can they be creepy!Amazing."
379,0,"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
6483,0,Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. Plus the guy can't sing he sounds like he is whining. Stay away from this song!!
19014,0,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the classic 1963 version. Not to mention the worst ending I have ever seen. The only things this movie has going for it are the special effects and the house itself even though the house in the 1963 version looked a lot scarier and more sufficating, like it was truely alive. If you get any movie get the original The Haunting."
9198,0,"This is definately worthy of the MST3K treatment. It's really lame! Super Mario Bros. is about as playful and challenging as an unplugged pinball machine. While it isn't as bad as it is said to be, it is an early example of why videogames don't make good movies. Oh well, it's definately worthy of an MST3K treatment."

12047,0,"This product looked fun but in reality was very uncomfortable and it vibes only at the middle! It's also very large (long) and didn't fit very well! Anyway, in summary, a neat idea, but not a staple or even fun for a one time use!"
4002,0,"The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names. Highly overrated."
3230,1,"I am enjoying this CD and find I am listening to it several times a day. The songs are addicting and I find myself singing out loud. Some of the songs are just fun to listen to and others can touch your soul. I highly recommend Aiken's ""Measure of A Man"". A++++"
10237,1,This monitor is great. The service I got when I order was fast and great. I would order again.
11565,1,I love this movie! The special effects are crazy and the storyline was interesting also. I highly recommend this movie.
5854,0,"Nelly sucks, we all know that's a fact. I'm glad the legendary KRS-ONE pulled his b!tch card, Nelly's feelings got hurt when he heard one of the pioneers tell him that he sucks. If nelly was a fat guy with a gheri curl he wouldn't sell any albums, since he's a fair-skinned, muscle bound tool, he sells. He seems to model himself after LL Cool J, who also sucks and had 1 good song his whole career. Don't encourage artists like Nelly by purchasing their records, it only insults the hip-hop community, which you probably would never understand if you're listening to this crap."
15356,1,"This wooden maze puzzle is a good exercise in problem solving. The child has to figure out how to move various vehicles out of the path of other vehicles in order to take each car, truck, ambulance, etc. to its home. My school kids enjoy using this puzzle because it is different from the puzzles they typically complete."
9119,0,"I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."

14631,1,"Great book, came in on time in pristine condition. Can't be any happier with it. Highly suggest people who run often to purchase this book, very revolutionary way to run so as to slow down the process of damaging our bodies while running."
8987,0,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! DO NOT BE FOOLED! This CD is not by NSYNC. It is by some no name cover band. I got taken once before by Amazon with a Ricky Martin single. I couldn't return it since I had opened it. So if you are looking for the CD single Bye Bye Bye, don't get this one. You will be dissapointed and stuck with a CD that is worthless and unreturnable once you open it. I got lucky and thought the cover of this one looked suspicious and was right. I promptly returned it. So always be careful and double check."
8852,1,I am a history buff so the movie was just great. The love they ended up with is not found in this world anymore.
13092,1,"We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
18268,1,"The guy who said this isn't HDTV is very, VERY wrong. This is an HDTV, but it doesn't have the tuner built inside of it. It supports HDTV, but you need a tuner in order to get it. This is an excellent piece of equipment for playing the xbox 360 on, although it definately has backlight leaking on the top and bottom. As said before, VERY bright screen and I also run it at 50%. Besides the backlight leak, it is an excellent HDTV/monitor and plays games well with NO ghosting. BUY IT!!"
17803,0,"The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!"
2974,1,"At the beginning of the movie, I was afraid about how Bruce Wayne become The BATMAN. But Christian Bale is since Michael Keaton, the only who can brought this legend come true.The screenplay is uncredible and very complete. You can forget everything you've seen before. BATMAN BEGINS is now the new reference in Super heroes movies. Spider-man, you don't have the lead anymore."
1388,1,"Guthrie covers all of the earlier Platonic dialogues in this volume, up to and including THE REPUBLIC. The next volume in the series (THE LATER PLATO AND THE ACADEMY) covers the rest. Each chapter covers one or two dialogues. Guthrie mentions work published by previous philosophers, and indicates where he agrees and disagrees. The book has a particular emphasis on the development of Plato's theory of the Forms and the influence of the Pythagoreans and Parmenides on Plato's thought. It's very reader-friendly yet packed with information. I can recommend both volumes to casual Plato fans."
17853,0,"I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it."
18726,1,"This is a great debut from the british sibling group Five Star released in 1985, it's songs are uptempo and catchy, quite bubbly but fun to listen too, it has a mixture of groovy R&B, dancey pop, and smooth ballads, a must cd for any fan of 80's music"
7924,1,This book is extremely useful for Java Architects that need to design scalable web applications. The author did a very good job describing all the proper design patterns that should be used in the presentation tier. This book appears to focus on the most important architectural issues in web development such as integrating the presentation tier with the business tier. I was also impressed with the author's ability to clearly defined how the new generation of struts design patterns should be used when building scalable web applications.
15128,0,"When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book."
12933,1,"I don't get to say this very often, but the Prince Caspian movie was better than the novel.When I read through the Narnia series a few months ago, I had the thought that for the books to be made into good films, the Disney writers were going to have to add some scenes, to fill in the blanks where C.S. Lewis' high creativity fell short.This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.Fun times.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
13180,1,"Batman Begins is an entertaining movie that has good action and gimmicks. There is really not a lot of depth, but these type of movies don't need a lot of depth. Here's why it's a 5 stay film:1) The overall story is interesting and flows very well.2) A number of top notch actors give good performances.3) The movie stays on track in doesn't get side tracked by focusing too much on a particular villian, as some of the previous Batman movies did.4) Christian Bale is one of the best Batmans we've seen. He comes across as a legitimate Bruce Wayne, someone who is a little secretive but who we can still get to know. I always felt that Val Kilmer was too aloof and Michael Keaton doesn't seem tough enough.5) The special effects are very good.All in all, there's a lot to like about this film. I's one of the most fun movies to watch of this year. Just be prepared for fun and action, because you're not going to get a real deep drama."
591,0,"This version of the film, from ROAN, should be avoided. The hour and 41 minute original is here chopped to an hour and 30 minutes. A mutilated film is no bargain at any price."
9682,1,"I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book."
2344,1,"I can't get enough of this CD. I play it every day, many times a day. I hear the next single will be ""The Way"" with ""Solitaire"" on the B-side, both perfect choices. Clay's voice gets more unbelievably beautiful every time I hear him. I was worried about this CD catering more to what passes for popular music today, but, thankfully every track is a gem and remains true to Clay himself and his fans. My favorites are No More Sad Song, The Way, I Will Carry You, Run to Me, but it's really hard to pick favorites because they are all so good. I simply cannot wait for a brand new full CD of Clay. He and his voice are a winner in every sense of the word...and don't forget he just won American Music Award's Fans' Choice and a Billboard award for his single, This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Waters. As Diane Sawyer said, ""He's on a rocket to the stars!"""
12750,0,"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
5310,1,The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks
5782,1,I refer to this book often to get God's perspective on grace and my new identity in Him.
6103,1,"This affectionate and humorous screenplay moves so quickly it may convert me to reading fewer novels, more screenplays. It is also a beautifully motivated piece and, in my opinion, Gompertz's best writing to date.

And, For some reason..it sounded better when i reviewed the tracks on line..than when i gave the entire CD a listen..The Production, isn't that good, & The Lyrics are Kinda Pointlessly PREACHY..I am a Big Fan of both Watson, and Turner, BUT..there is a LOT to be desired on this recording..."
13893,1,"I read this book back in high school, thinking ""Well, it's a classic. One of those books I SHOULD read."" I was right. There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read. There's constant references to this in media, pop culture, etc. It's just an important piece of literature. I think every single person who cares about their own intelligence should read this book. You just HAVE TO! Nuff said."

9468,1,I really enjoyed reading this book; it is well written. It opened worlds I had no knowledge of. My father was raised in the Hood River Valley and went to school with some mentioned in this book; this is real and living history to me. My life has been forever changed.
8477,0,I don't care if it's a classic. It went nowhere. There was no point. I could not bring myself to care what happened to the characters. It was not an enjoyable read.
17141,0,"This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
4595,0,"This review is not about the movie in general. There are enough of those here already. However the DVD was very dissapointing. Purportedly the sound was upgraded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The sound instead is washed out and the volume difficult to maintain at one level. Often volume needs to be increased to hear the actors and then reduced again as the background music swells. Almost as bad is the video. It's as if they produced the DVD off an old, beat up print. Small flashes of white and black spots continually appear throughout the movie.I bought the DVD at a reputable retailer, but it plays like a bootleg."
8828,0,"I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
5124,0,Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them.
3679,0,"Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour. He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end. Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase ""Chi running"" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware."
1452,1,"These were cheap and effective, they sound great considering that they are driven by a the original OEM radio/deck. Other speakers for the same price don't compare, and were returned, they can't hold up the bass parts as well as these."
12696,0,"This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!"
3766,1,"When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!"
10372,0,"Maybe a lot of people enjoy being addressed as though they're just a little bit dumber than this 1st time Mother, but I did not. The author writes as though becoming a mother is akin to being left alone in the nuclear bomb assembly room without an employee handbook. As a first-timer I needed more specific information and less hand-holding from a fellow neophite. Keep looking if you want a book that will yield something useful when he's crying frantically at 3:00AM."
13013,1,Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. The movie was awesome and I can't say enough about the whole experiece.
6354,1,"Gave this to a friend in October.... they finally solved it in Dec when her relatives came to visit.... the Univ of Virginia student solved it! She will pass it on to our other friends for their birthdays...Really like the game, its made well and it is harder than you think. I actually had to get my William and Mary graduate to put it together! I also gave one to my Mom for Christmas, who has not solved it yet. She will pass it on to her ladies she plays cards with. Its fun and different....a good conversation piece!"

I've seen Lord of the Wu Tang by the way and it is a top notch cheesey sci fi Sunday morning karate flick with pull wires galore. The story line is classic as well and well worth any amount of sub title reading and convinced me the best chinese karate flicks are sub-titled. I've gotta contact Amazon about the switch that happened, hopefully it works out."

16819,0,"I bought this video while thinking to myself, ""hot chicks beating the crap out of each other, sweet"". Well, none of these things turned out to be the case. The chicks aren't hot, in fact one either used to be a man, or still is a man. The violence is limp to say the least. Imagine an episode of cops where neighbors at the trailer park are in a domestic disturbance. The problem is that the girls aren't athletes, nor do they seem to care much if they win. Stay away, this is just some dude with a camcorder attempting to get you to part with your money."

2768,1,Typical of George C. Scott he lives into the Patton character. You do however realise that this is not the same man who lead the 3rd Army into victory in Europe. He is tired and exhausted. One could relive the last days of agony in which Patton found himself during this terrible time in his life with Scott. An excellent performance. I would recommend this to anybody who is in the first place a fan of Scott and in the 2nd place a Patton fanatic. A must have for all who are interested in Biographies of WWII leaders.

I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"

155,1,Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.

10777,1,"In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening."

18092,1,"I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."
15471,1,"Boehme's `Way to Christ' is a contemplative work that can be read as a meditation. He originated the Myth of the Ungrund, but Boehme placed the entire myth under God's control. His work on the Ungrund led to Berdyaev's existential view of God and was foundational for the meonic nothingness found in Berdyaev. `The Way to Christ' might be hard for modern readers to connect with, but if readers take the time to soak in the word, it can add to a person's spiritual journey. The language will not always be obvious or understandable, but Boehm wrote in a context that was very different from 21st century Westerners."
13949,1,"Anton chekhov's ""the cherry orchard"" is a captivating, but somewhat confusing tale of an aristocratic household that comes face to face with adversity. His impressionistic portrayal of characters delivers a power packed package of meaning that both appeals to and appalls every human heart. Through a subtle messages and powerful passages chekhov purveys his sentiments about a world that is tainted by a dark cloud of selfishness. Although the play itself is tragic-like the characters are not tragic. They seem to blindly stumble upon the pages of life accomplishing absolutely nothing. Through checkhov's genius they still remain human, with dreams and fears like the rest of us. It is through these characters that chekhov's beliefs are made known."
4049,0,"Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."

What a concept!!! Clay's voice and emotion come through crystal clear on each and every track. While I've been a Clay fan since his Atlanta audition, I know people who weren't and they have listened to the CD and are now convinced. No matter what perception you may have about Clay, the man can sing!"
10853,0,"I was looking for a doll-that-wets to help me potty train my 3 year old daughter. The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT. It makes a big title of glory that doesn't need batteries, but it absolutely does not rise to the expectations listed on the box, and I would personally get a battery doll that works, than this one."
19932,1,"Okay, I had to read this book for school. From the description on the back I didn't think that it would be very interesting. I was wrong.

I only wish that the ending was developed more and wasn't one of those ""use your imagination"" endings."

He receives assistance from a group of nuns in a nearby retreat.He obliges by doing chores for the nuns. The superior nun persuades himto build them a chapel. Homer is at first reluctant, but soon the projectbecomes as important to him as it is to the nuns. Poitier received a well-deserved Oscar for his role. Lilia Skala was nominated for BestSupporting Actress as the leader of the nuns. A spiritually feel-goodfilm. Excellent. (4 stars out of 5)"
16763,0,"I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."

Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!"
1783,1,"Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs."

7589,0,"This book is long. Long and pointless. Sure, it's fun to sit down and make up words, or compose stream-of-consciousness relayings of dreams we've had, but why would anyone want to read them?And, anyway, any book with a quote on the back from Harold Bloom is not worth MY time, at the very least. That man is a menace, and so is James Joyce. Thinkers thinking about thinking. Not real people, not real thoughts, no significance, no soul. Pointless, long, and forgettable."
14133,1,"This is a great tape for anyone looking for a low-impact all aerobic workout. All the routines are done to the inspiring oldies but goodies music.

She obviously enjoys what she does and it shows.This tape should be part of your basic collection."

2660,0,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."

10560,0,"After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."

3764,1,"This book is for the one's who don't have time to read or know what style of writing they like. ""Of Mice and Men"" is a book that almost anyone can read in a day. You'll silently pray for the outcome that seems so close, yet so far away; you'll rejoice for Lennie putting a stop to the beating by the man with a ""glove fulla vasaline;"" and you'll shudder at the shocking conclusion that you should have expected throughout the whole novel but don't. If you like tragedy, comedy, suspense, or irony, you won't be able to put ""Of Mice and Men"" down"
18965,0,The product deflated during the night. We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air. I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress. I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item. Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated.
8670,0,"I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
14259,1,This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores. I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt. I would have given it five stars but he hasn't had time to try them on yet so I can't give a perfect score.

13098,1,"I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."

Finally, of the few books out there regarding what to expect during basic training, this book is the best and most current. I've read the other two (including Mr. Thompson's first edition) and can say with certainty this book (2nd edition) is highly informative and insightful. You can even e-mail the author for more info. The best advice, don't trust just one book or just one source for your information.I ended up not enlisting for full time service, but still considering the Reserves. I'm glad I had this book to make an informed decision.Good luck if you are going in!"
19682,1,"Maeve Binchy is a great storyteller. All of her books are filled with character description and are definately page turners. The Silver Wedding took me by suprise the way each character had different views on the same events which is usually true in real life. This is the seventh book of Binchy's that I have read and everytime I finish one, I can't wait to start the next. The Silver Wedding, although not my favorite of hers, lived up to my expectations of Bincy's marvelous ability to telling a story. Definately recommende d as a summer read. (or anytime!)"
19140,1,"This is definitely a well written book. It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK."
9237,0,"I am unable to put my hands thru the opening. The opening for the wrist is to small (approx 1 3/4 inches )and the weights are non adjustable. They may work best for someone who has very very small hands. But for the average size person I would not suggest these weights. Maybe the company should use stretchable material or add velcro to make them adjustable. I rated this product a 1 because of the feel of the material and the overall size of the weights. I am going to assume that if I could get them on, they would be very comfortable."
6049,0,"I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home."

16805,0,"I got this book hoping to get more insight on, well, ""cases that haunt us"". This book and several others by Douglas, turned out to be a self-serving puff piece on several complicated cases. This is the literary equivelant of Leslie Neilsen in ""The Naked Gun"" saying ""Move along, there's nothing to see here"" as a fireworks warehouse explodes behind him.Some of these cases deserve serious examination and not a simplistic write-off. Check out Terry Maury's ""The Ultimate Evil"" to see where thorough investigation of these crimes can lead."
9772,0,"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
17276,1,"excellent product, but has a very short range of reception and battery life is short lived. You have to adjust the tuner several times before obtaining a good picturem, but not bad for a childs toy as beginner. would recommend to younger kids because it is a fun toy."
5715,0,"The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters. Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I didn't like but couldn't leave. Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film."
2774,0,"I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."
15677,0,".....Big freakin' deal!!! It doesn't make up for how much the music stinks!If you are reading this right now, that means you are probably pondering whether to buy this junk. And that makes you an idiot. How can you support something like this? This comes from a really bad TV show that is not even watchable unless your brains are mashed potatoes!Neil Young said it best when asked what he thought of Clay Aiken and the whole American Idol thing: ""Well, he ain't Jerry Garcia."" Exactly. Jerry actually had heart and put emotion into his music.Do yourself a favor and go listen to some real music, not this goober completely butchering The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel."
4134,1,"This product is just what I expected, minus the fact that due to being white, you can easily see my nipples through the shirt. I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts, but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue. The transparency of these white shirts, combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt, so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run. Minus one star for shame."
9620,1,"I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer."

If you are serious about travel with your electronics (not just Apple) check out this:Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter.

6435,0,"We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
8174,1,"This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."
11728,0,"Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry ""Forever February"" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Don't Mess With Mr. T"" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances."
12824,0,"Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."

First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared.

8152,0,"My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."

9142,0,"I saw this billed as a ""super hero"" style movie. I read the description, and was hesitant to watch it, but it had a fairly high rating, and I could sort of imagine a guy with ""super powers"" to kick some demon tail. What I got instead was a rather depressing, horror flick. To me the story line stunk. This could have been fun. It had good special effects, yet it managed to depress me and bore me. Really disappointed!"

14248,1,"Released in March of 1980, DREAM STREET ROSE had all the makings of a classic Lightfoot recording. Every track shines on its' own. The opening track ""Sea of Tranquility"" is mesmerizing with its' blend of steel, electric guitar and keyboards. This should have been the first single from the album. ""Sea.."" is definately one of the highlights as is the title track, ""On the High Seas"", ""Whisper My Name"" and ""If You Need Me"". This is definately the BEST record that Lightfoot has created."

13982,1,"The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."

Usually, when I buy a CD, I have one or maybe, two tracks that I really like, but this CD doesn't have just one or two, they are all great!!! Definitely worth buying and listening to!"
1698,0,"My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."

Set back in 1912, you will feel as if you were there for these intimate talks with two very enlightened men. My heart was filled with joy and my eyes with tears in reading and experiencing a trip back in time to a spiritual world full of mysteries This book will leave you with a sense of joy, peace and awe at the Glory of God and our purpose in this life. This very personal book will pierce your soul."
17049,0,"As a math major, I am of course interested in the subject of Real Analysis. But I cannot agree with the other reviews in that the book is very UNACCESSIBLE to undergraduates! I have poured through the first 3 chapters until I almost have them memorized and the concepts are NOT CLEAR. Instead of explaining what is going on, the author rambles on about the ""beauty"" of his subject and how ""we"" as students should ""carefully"" digest the ideas. The examples and proofs are NOT clear and are NOTHING like the HW problems! In fact the proofs are so incomplete, that proving them in the fashion that the author does, does not convince my professor??? This book is a BIG waste of over $100 and a class that I might have enjoyed if the author could see outside of his ego and stop trying to show off to undergraduates who do not know the subject yet!"

14106,0,"I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1"" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."
9521,0,"Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing."
17678,0,Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.
2380,0,This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one.

10178,0,"Sometimes pastiches work well, like Bach's B Minor Mass. Not so this autobiography. Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience. Go there if you must do Franklin."

I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."

If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders."
531,0,"This whole book is ridiculous. Instead of wasting tons of space and loads of my time, I'll wrap it up quickly: What Douglass purports to be true in his book, i.e., the transfer of US POWs to the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia could not have happened. Look at the timeline. Douglass would have rational people believe that the Soviets would use the Czechs to transfer US POWs at the same time the Soviets INVADED Czechoslovakia. So, let's see - the evil KGB would enlist the help of the same people they were CRUSHING? Come on. This is ridiculous and shows that anyone can get a book published."

5758,1,Very Fast shipping. Product arrived in perfect condition. Pins were a perfect fit. Washers were all same size there should be one slightly larger than the other per set... No big deal though.... since the washers do not move for proper door functionality I simply wrapped the smaller washer with electrical tape to give it a snugg fit and it works perfectly fine.... other than that small but fixable detail ... Perfect!!
13719,0,"It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward."
5996,0,"This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
3685,0,"I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all."
6074,1,"I HIGHLY recommend this album for ANY Clay Aiken fan! I have watched Clay from day one, when he entered that room with Simon, Randy and Paula, and declared himself the ""American Idol"". In my opinion, he IS the American Idol! I could not wait for this album to be released and I am NOT disappointed! The first three songs are wonderful---one of my favorites being ""Measure of a Man"", the title song of this CD. This is only his FIRST album and I predict the next to be even better! Congratulations, Clay, for the release of your first album! I look forward to watching it soar thru the charts!"

7914,0,"When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in ""Diary"" or ""LP2"" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."

12165,0,"This movie was not as good as it seems. When i first rented it, I thought it was going to be pretty good considering I like classic horror films. But to my belief, it was very boring. The begining was pretty interesting with the couple looking for an appartment to rent, and the dead body in the begining/middle. But after a while it was very bland. Especially the part where she gets pregnant. I actually laughed during one part where she was ""floating on a bed in the middle of the ocean"". I rated it one star only because of the connections the movie made at the end with all of its characters. There was only one exciting part where i was saying to myself, ""finally"" but then it ended very quickly. I thought her decision was ludacris at the end. Don't waist two hours like i did watching this film."
19800,1,"This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent."

11946,1,Dr. Marrs' Fertility Book is a handy reference for couples who may be experiencing infertility. Dr. Marrs clearly explains the various procedures used to determain the cause(s) of infertility. He also provides detailed explainations on the various treatments used to try and acheive pregnancy.

15798,1,"I bought this album after seeing the ""Toxcicity"" video on MTV2. I had known a few of System of a Down's songs, but after I heard this song, I really liked it. I must admit, I'm a little dissapointed in the album overall, but nonetheless, I enjoy listening to it. I love the songs Chop Suey, Atwa, and Toxicity. Those songs made the album well worth buying. The other songs, however, all sound alike, but are okay to listen to. Despite this, I do not regret buying this album. Be your own judge."
8165,1,"Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. Their mix of heavy techno and heavy alternative rock makes this band unique and special..oh yes by the track on this CD. Very good CD, Garbage is original and great to rock out to and also to mellow out to...buy the CD!"
7343,1,"Though the Carlyle glassware is currently out of stock, I decided to write a review assuming they'll be back. I bought these glasses over a year ago after noticing that I was down to mismatched glasses in the cabinet that I didn't like much.After looking around the store, I decided on these. Generally, I like to buy glasses at a physical store because of the ""touch"" factor. Each of the exterior widening ""steps"" in the design helps keep the glass from slipping from one's grasp. Simple, but very cool idea that looks good too. It's been great for kids (runs in the family). They come out of the dishwasher looking great. I also like the idea that this is an old design from the 1930's.Finally, maybe the best thing; they're tough, and don't break when you'd expect. We've accidentally knocked them off a side table onto our marble floor too many times and are always amazed that they're in one piece.These are great for everyday use and I highly recommend them."

14630,1,"Just a grea product from Dell! I never regret purchasing this lcd monitor though my 17 inch CRT which this replaced was truly sharp. This lcd is totally comparable in sharpness which is a plus when editing your digital pictures. It being flat makes you take back very much needed space, of course. If you only have analog connector on your pc you will still find this lcd okay. I installed a pc card with digital connector on my pc thus allowing its signal to stay digital (versus the pc converting its signal to analog so you could use your crt monitor which is of course analog). With this size, I tend to watch my dvds here than on my 50 inch Regza flat TV."

17650,0,I owned many models of Mail Station & loved them from the years 1999-2006 but since then there are no ISP servicers for this gadget. It used to be owned by Earthlink whom was then bought out by Cidco and now there isn't anyone providing service to send/receive emails with this thing which is too bad since it was easy & fun and a way to communicate without the internet without spam or any advertizing. Whenever mailstation has a new provider ( doubtful ) I will purchase another 1 year contract as my gadget still functions it's just that I cannot connect without an ISP. Everyone whom owns this thing knows what I speak of; it's obsolete so why buy one ? ( If you read the disclaimer below it states they won't supply service to new customers ; so what is the point in buying this ? )

7004,0,"The book presents a historical and political account of the middle east from 1922-1984. The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East."

14864,1,"Basically the story is about 2 swords, 1 contains (inside the sword) the instructions for the most powerful kung fu, the other contains instructions how to lead an army and become China's emperor.But on one knows this secret. Everyone thinks these are magical swords and would give their owners invicibility.So the fight begins for the 2 swords...This is story a bit confusing, purely because the original story is over 3000 (3 thousand pages) long.What makes it even more confusing is this story is a sequel to another 3000 pages Kung Fu story.So to try and compress 6000 pages to a couple of hours on DVD would confuse any viewer unless you already know the story !Anyway, this is the best Kung Fu story ever. It was first published on a HK news paper in the 1960s.Most Asian males should know this story !"

11742,1,"I loved this book the first time I read it in college. But after re-reading it, I've concluded that while Voltaire has a lot going on in this story, there is a simple formula directing the action: Candide meets some people. They do him wrong somehow. On the verge of death Candide escapes. Rinse, repeat.I still love reading the early chapters, they are comical masterpieces. I see Cunegonde in an entirely different light now than when I was younger. Candide and Pangloss are still naive morons, of course. And I have new found appreciation for Martin.Overall, Candide is great fun, but can get repetitious. Best read in one sitting."

9014,0,"The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."

However, as my baby is very active, crawling and learning to walk, very often he gets cuts or red bruises on his thighs, sometimes on the tummy, where the fastening tabs touch the skin.Please Pampers do something about the sharpness of the tabs."

However, those who like good old straigh-forward HC will be pleased with this album. Good aggressive tracks from the beginning. The only really negative point I can think of is the fact that the different songs were recorded in three blocks: 1 in '99, another in 2000 and the other in 2003. The 2003 sessions sound great but the others aren't as clear and good sounding... Great album nontheless..."
16961,0,"What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."

11221,0,"The chain is so thin and flimsy, I'm afraid that if I wear it I'll lose it. I think that it might fall off of my neck. Years ago, I had a similar chain that did that, but I only paid about $6.00 or $7.00 for it. It was sterling silver, too. And, the whole necklace is so little and scarce. The way that it was made to look in the adverisement made me feel like I was really getting a good deal. Instead, I feel like I got taken. I thought that the chain would at least be thicker and stronger--I mean, for $30.00. If I could've seen the actual chain before buying it, I wouldn't have paid more than $10.00 for it."

19027,1,"I disagree with the other reviewer. I think the title describes this book beautifully, because the alcoholic adult in the story WAS ""just another kid"" and that's the way Hayden treated her. I found this a deeply moving book. It is easy to love and want to help small children, even difficult ones. It is harder to have the same kind of feelings for adults. That Hayden showed so well that adults are ""just other children"" was beautifully done, I thought."

13369,0,"The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a good book because it shows how someone could take care of another person that isn't very intelligent. It shows how someone could not be smart but still work hard. I liked this book because it showed how someone could committ a crime but for a good cause. I would recommend this book for soft-hearted people. Ramone P.The book ""Of Mice and Men"" didn't really interest me because in a way the title didn't really fit the story. Also, the point of the story was not clear. The title didn't fit the story because the whole book wasn't about mice and men. The only thing in the book about mice was when Lennie kept picking up mice and having them as pets. This book kind of interested me on behalf of Lennie because he wasn't very intelligent; he was retarted. I recommend this book to any one who is in depth with retarted people. Teaira T."

So after visiting the HP support site, which led me thru a tedious half hour of searching thru files and deleting over 30 files manually, it then directed me to a page where I could download a new HP driver.

The recording is poor compared to today's standards and IT'S ONLY ABOUT 20 MINUTES LONG.Sure, the information is great but I want to know more. When the CD was over I felt cheated. Almost like I got an advertising piece that gives you a teaser of what the book is about so you can buy it.Please understand, this has nothing to do with the option method which sounds great and I wish to know more about. The review is for the CD itself which is a complete waste of money."

10685,1,"What a great movie!! Much better than the first, the action is awesome, the scenery beautiful, the music just wonderful, and the actors were, as always, brilliant. I just loved this film and how the characters came together at the end to fight the Talmarians. There were a few bothering scenes as when Caspian and Peter would fight, but Susan's character was great. At one point it reminded me of Legolas fighting and Lucy looks so grown up and her character's growth from the first film is very nicely done. Edmund fights more in this film and he's also great, his character comes full circle as you'll see and the horse shots were some of my favorites as well. A must buy for anyone!!"

There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in ""The Illuminated Manuscripts..."" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form."

I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."

The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere.

On a better note, The Asylum does put out some pretty good B rate stuff. Later Dudes."
14792,0,"I got this toy for easter. From the comercials I thought the toy would be an action game like a pokemon where it would be in color and I would meet other animals and play with them. But it seemed to be just like those Giga-pets and Tomaguchies. You would get to costomize your pet like what the personality is, but that is the only difference between that and a Giga-pet. The game is completely black and white. One of the things in the game that I didn't like was that you needed to feed your neo pet at certain times of the day and if you feed your neo pet later than that certain time it dies. I would suggest buying it over summer vacation becasue if you don't you'll have to feed it during school."
1799,1,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books.

13554,1,"Its sad that the movie will only last a week or two in the theatres since it is a good rip roaring adventure that loosely follows the Lafayette Escadrille in WWI. The special effects are excellent, the planes and action appears to be real. If you get a chance see it on the big screen, it will lose a lot on video"
13699,1,"This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!"

Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle.

12768,0,"I was eager to read this book because it's set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. She has talent, it's undeniable, but Scott is far too enchanted with her own writing to tell a decent story. Every time I found myself beginning to be captivated by the narrative or the chatacters, I'd stumble across a highly polished, self-conscious set-piece of prose that screamed ""HEY! Look at me...don't I write well?!"" After a second attempt to finish this book I am giving up on it and moving on."

I was sick of spending money on expensive digital (inconsistent) models, that stopped working after only a year or so of use. This unit provides consistent readings at eye level.

As always, Neil Innes provides sharp and witty banter recounting the history of how the Bonzo tracks came into existence, and the music never fails to delight, especially 'The Craig Torso Show' where I would have nearly fell about laughing if I wouldn't have been in the car ('Craig Torso smells wonderfuuuuuuul'). Minus one star for again mis-labelling Sidney Nicholls (aka Big Sid, the guy playing banjo in the numbered group shot) as Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell."

Drying the Rain is a great song, but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album. It really is just a bunch of noise. Main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack. Trust Me."
19136,1,"My 2 year old and 1 year old enjoy this alot. It is not something that we leave up all of the time due to space restrictions in our home. It works great for a rainy day or weekend. It is very quick to set-up and take down. It folds up very well for storageand would be very easy to pack in a suitcase and take on vacation. Its not the greatest quality product, but I do not know what other reviewers were expecting (maybe a backpacking tent for climbing Everest?). Overall, I am very satisfied, the construction has held up to pretty intense play, the kids enjoy it, and its ease of use make it a winner for us."
17537,0,Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.

I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the ""gentleness and thoughtfulness"" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."

It does have an ethernet port, but there's no point in networking a printer that doesn't print. Also, if you get stuck with vague cartridge errors, removing one of the two ink cartridges may be a work around. Not acceptable performance, though.This printer's about to go the way of Old Yeller, and be replaced with something that actually prints."

18696,1,I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
9496,1,"I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. I ordered it the day before Thanksgiving, and it was shipped out to me the Friday after. It arrived in good condition in plenty of time for me to review before using it in the class room."
17068,0,"I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets."
18178,0,"I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!"
2785,0,We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
13041,1,"Yes the more emoish metalcore is becoming so ""trendy"" but that's cool, just as long as they're good, but for AMAZING metalcore, Red Chord is where it is at. This nine-song masterpiece ends in just under half hour and delivers some of the most intelligent compositions heavy music has heard. Sometimes so backwards that you can't even tell what's going and other times so bone-crushing that you have to step away from the speakers for fear of your life, but no matter what the riffs work together perfectly through each song. The guitarist is incredible. The drumming is superb as well, with lots of quick time changes and riffs that are played once, the man on the throne keeps it together and flowing. All in all this is great for fans of truly talented music and should be in your CD collection. BUY IT!"
16904,0,"I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."
13998,0,This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
6225,0,"Weak story, Characters were not interesting or engaging and Vampire rules were silly. Also tired of the Gay=slutty and incapable of an adult relationship. Can't we do better?"
7187,0,"Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
4745,0,"I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real."
11730,1,This is a really cute book with beautiful pictures. I like the quotes that have been included as well.
9946,0,"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give ""2 stars"" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!"
2183,0,"I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another ""Flashdance,"" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."

1048,0,"I have read all the reviews, before, and again after, since my unit crapped out...It lasted 6 months, light use. The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers, never used all at once, maybe two pair, and it just crapped out after 6 months. The fuse wasn't blown, the lights still came on, it just stopped working. I had my doubts on a $100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true. I am looking at other brands now."
8682,1,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption."
8518,1,This was a wondeful process. I would buy from Amazon again and again. It is especially great for the older hard to find movies.If anyone knows how to find the movie Madame X with Lana Turner and John Forsyth let me know. I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Thanks again
1898,0,it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library.
7751,1,"i'm surprised more people haven't discovered this beautiful little movie. hopefully they will soon. so charming, so unpretentious, so authentic. even if you've never gotten a haircut, you will love it."
3244,0,It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered! So they run a lot smaller. It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling.
11222,0,After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!

8389,1,I am totally down with this CD. Its worth the money ya smack down to get it! Each song has a catchy mini-tune combined with total rhyme clusters. These guys are like a heavy Beastie Boys. Limp Bizkit can't touch'em! I urge any heavy metal/rap fans to get this...you will go home happy!
5995,1,"I just love this book. It's really amazing. I read Gail Howard's columns in lottery magazines. I know she has had many ""lottery"" winners using her books, but I think this book is the best of all of them. I can't rave enough."
7021,0,"I tried to read this book when it first came out. I couldn'tfinish it. There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient ""cities of the red night"" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it."
6616,1,"This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V."
14258,0,"Only the Clay-maniacs will like this one. It is simply horrible. I give it two stars, being generous, because I like Clay and I think he can sing. The material is bad. Did they MAKE him sing these poorly written songs? If you bought the single 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' then you bought the best of Clay, this I am sorry, is not."

17641,1,"The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, ""I could not put it down."" This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."
17060,0,"Rarely have I been so put-off by a book. I take nothing away from the experience and hardhships of the generation of Americans who suffered the depression and WWII. That surely is a 5-Star story and my parents lived it. But this book is not that story. Instead I find cliche's and stereotypes. For sure, the last 50 years of American history has been one of accomplishment and success. But it is easy to forget that this was largely because the rest of the industrial world was in rubble after the War, and America had a special opportunity to excel and grow. - - I feel alarm bells when any group of people are described as special or superior. This type of thinking has resulted in too much suffering in our world. I suspect the reality is that Brokaw is laying the groundwork for a political career. Is 'The Greatest Generation' the modern 'Profiles in Courage?.'"
7650,1,"Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. ""Man of La Mancha"" has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short, heart-warming play that is, if possible, even greater than the source material.In ""Man of La Mancha"", the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is ""insanity""? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"
5105,1,This is the book that got me buying the other two in the series. I got it through the lending library on my kindle fire. I love the books that just appeal to me. Its much better than watching a movie.
15434,0,"I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."
19812,1,"Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more! He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read. I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it, too, for the students' sake!"
18283,0,The book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school. This version Bored me to tears.
8002,0,"Not sure what the other person was smoking when reviewing this book, but must be a beginner to Dire Straits. This was very poorly done. In many places, the tabs are incorrect. It looks like the transcriber just did what they thought or liked rather than validate it. I would not have bought this book if I had known how wrong it was. I suppose on a plus note it provides an alternate method. Also, the print it too small.Don't buy the book. There are free tabs on the internet that are closer to the way it was played."
6879,0,"I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
3143,0,"the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time."
13516,1,"My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. This set of books is unbelieveable in the sense that Schwartz's storytelling knows exactly how to get to you. I'm a senior in college, and yet I still remember quite vividly reading the stories and being afraid to go near the back of our yard because it backed up to a field. In book two (I believe) the story of the thing in the mirror STILL gives me chills at night (my dorm room has a full-length mirror in it, and I hang my robe over it at night!)And, of course, my father knew just what to do to make me really remember the stories...like sneaking up behind me when I was feeding our rabbits at night at the back of the yard (next to the field, of course)I would highly recommend this collection of stories to anyone who is young at heart, or just wants to scare the pants off of their child (or sibling). The memories are well worth the cost of the books!"
3426,1,"Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."

124,0,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."

17214,0,"I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it. I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble. Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.What are the publishers thinking? Does their greed know no bounds? They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost. Amazon had it right when they launched the Kindle $9.99 for hot sellers, yeah I can get behind that but I can't get behind what the publishers strong armed Amazon into."

17179,0,"ok--first of all, saying that this CD is the ""best"" of anything is completely wrong, and don't give me that Bullsh*t about ""you try to write something"" thats not the issue. the issue is the fact that this CD contains Horrible quality tracks that someone who put 200$ into some mics could top. Nirana rocks, but this cd blows.Thx courtney, now go do some blow."
16859,1,"I just received this recipe book and have already identified a number of recipes for meals this week. The recipes contain ingredients that are easy to obtain in my somewhat rural area. I really like that the author provides the nutritional information for each recipe (including calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, cholesterol and sodium). Although I was looking for a low-carb vegetarian recipe book, I am also concerned with fat and cholesterol content and the recipes in this book also appear to be conscious of those as well. Lacto-ovo vegetarians could easily substitute regular cheese for soy cheese and add eggs to some of the recipes."
14414,1,"Clay Aiken is going places noone has been in a long, long time. What a talent! What a voice! What a role model to today's youth.... thanks Clay!"
3608,1,This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.

3572,1,"The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other."
11716,0,The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.

3302,0,"The movie is great, that's why i bought the movie, but i also wanted to see all the special features, that's the reason i bought it a blue-ray dvd for this movie.Unfortunately a lot of these special features are not working. They appear in the special features menu screen, but when i press their link, the dvd tries to load the segment, but then it returns to the disc menu screen with out showing the short. It happens with the following special features: Batman-The Journey Begins, Shaping Mind and Body, Gotham City Rises, Cape and Cowl, Batman-The Tumbler, Path to Discovery, Saving Gotham City. Other features such as The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue, Digital Batman work fine.It is a shame that most of the special features do not work, i am dissappointed with the quality of this product."

14743,0,"Backgammon Attache 18""Backgammon set arrived today. First inspection disappointing. It is poorly constructed, as follows: stitching is inconsistent; points are not sewed down; some side seams ""show air""; board border seams uneven as if not properly glued. The pieces are lightweight, not a good feel. Overall it's seems cheap. Not going to hold up. Does not have the tactile feel of a good procuct. Tactile feel is very important to me. I am disapppointed that the manufacturer did not have a sense of ethics for creating a good product, and that this piece of junk even passed inspection. It may be an acceptable board for a child learning to play, with the caveat that it will not hold up. I now start all over searching the internet for a well made board."
2329,1,"This is a wonderful second chapter to the Narnia series. The choice of actors is excellent and the CGI mixed with the live action is completely cool. This is one of the few fantasy movies that makes for beleivable looking characters out of the non-human races. The first movie was great and followed the orignal story so well, and the follow-up did not fail in its mission either. The children have grown as have their characters and it is wonderful. The story from begining to end is intrigueing and again, follows C.S.Lewis' story so well, that I would defintly tell anyone to get this for their collection. A wonderful movie for anyone of any age."
8655,0,"this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it."

15040,1,"I've always made a big deal about how much I do not like Steinbeck or Hemingway, but after reading a couple of both of theirs this year, I have to admit that I LOVE both. As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book. Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."
4338,0,"I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals."
6957,1,"These Pampers have been the winners for our son - no leaks, super absorbent, easy to put on.The equivalent Huggies were a disaster - no matter how tight we put the Huggies on him, he managed to wriggle around and get some pee out of one gap or another. So he needed a new onesie for every diaper change....In cloth diapers, we have to change him as soon as he pees or poops, because the cloth diapers are not as absorbent. He's not used to the wet feeling, and he does NOT like it! So we use one cloth diaper a day, just to give him a break / change of pace.If not for these Pampers, our lives would be a lot less pleasant right now."
16793,0,"i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring."
7250,1,"I never watched American Idol and I rarely listen to pop music, but I clicked on this CD one day and listened to the clips just to see what all the fuss was about. I liked what I heard, bought it, and I have played it every day since then. There's just something about it, there's not a bad track on there. Is it the most well-crafted, lyrically sophisticated CD made this year? No, but it is entertaining, catchy, and let's face it, Clay's voice could make the phone book sound good. There isn't anything that is going to appeal to everyone. If you like what you hear from the clips, you're going to like the whole CD."
17918,1,I love Pampers diapers. The diapers never leak even at nighttime or long road trips with our babies.

Wrde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."

7415,1,"These are wonderful postcards for any dog and/or animal lover. The photos are very well-done and the dogs are adorable.As the previous reviewer stated, the postcards are black and white pictures of dogs with a short bit of information on the back including the photographer, title and date of the photograph and a short bit of information on the dog in the photo.They are printed on thick 6"" x 6"" cardstock, which will make them durable in the mail (if you intend to mail them). However, it should be noted that at this size, the postcards mail at letter rate and not postcard rate."
9139,1,A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Guaranteed discussion starter.

17805,0,I didn't see the logic behind this garment. It's suppose to hold in the belly but yet there's a little opening at the bottom where my belly sticks out from. I sent this back and got the bottomless one. I love that one i have been wearing that one for years.
18450,0,"I've had a few of WP's coffees before, which were fine. This medium light roast I purchased recently ""Tuscan breakfast"" was undrinkable. Yes, it smelled fresh and robust. Thats where the kind adjectives end. I brewed 2 pots of this acidic, bitter, and harsh beverage that I wouldnt wish on anyone first thing in the morning, before deciding to spare you all the same fate... A better name might have been ""Industrial Byproduct"". Of course, some people feel thats what makes a REAL coffee. But if this came to a my table at a restaurant, I would have been, to say the least, dissatisfied.A little side note for those purchasing this or one of the more acceptable blends... the bag is a nightmare to open. Save yourself the frustration and grab a scissors. Cut the whole top off which seems welded together down to the wire wrap."
15860,1,"Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
5459,1,"I bought this with the intention of being slighlty dissappointed since AP made the incredibly bold statement of saying that they are the last ""great"" pop band of the millenium. There is no denying the fact that the way I heard music was completely revolutionized even with the first listen of The Three E.P's. The patience, imagination, and originality shown in this collection of tunes is not given true justice with my petty description. Buy this if you want to be blown away by the capabilities of music. This is the coolest thing I have heard since DJ Shadow's Entroducing. Saying that these four guys are the real deal is a drastic understatement."
10322,1,A real tight C.D. In my opinion two times better than his original with better production and better lyrics. A couple of tracks were sleepers but without a doubt worth picking up when you see it.
10185,0,"This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
10360,0,"The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much. I am about average hieght 5 6"" and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature. My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit didn't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked."
8344,1,"For my baby shower we did a diaper raffle, so I received every diaper brand out there. These are by far the best out there. My little boy is 5 months old and is in size 3. Never any leakage problems even through the night. All my friends swear by them too!!!"
13382,1,"Great toy, well made, good for learning, bu c'mon, $20 + bucks is too much for this type of toy."
11708,1,"I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed ""WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist""...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2609,0,"I ordered this sight unseen, and unfortunately cannot recommend other similar dictionaries. However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work. When I return to the market for such a dictionary, I will search for better option."
14755,1,"James Moody, and his well known ""cast of characters"" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've ""never heard it played like THAT before""."
12281,1,Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
541,0,I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.
18484,0,These diapers do not have a stretchy wastband. Poop frequently runs up my childs back!!! I will never use these diapers again because of all the extra laundry and mess they created for me.
10373,0,"The poster arrived quickly, but it was very poor quality. It was blurry and was obviously a photo of the real thing that was then blown up on a copy machine. I emailed the supplier multiple times with no response. I called and was given instructions on how to return the poster. Sent it back, but no credit to my account or acknowledgement. I finally gave up, which is what they probably expected. Won't do service with this supplier again."
12210,0,"I had been a fan of Pamers brand since my baby was a just a day older. I loved pamper's Cruiser but Baby Dry no longer keeps the baby dry. It gets saturated very quickly and sometimes leaks. With Pamper's Baby Dry diapers, you will have to change diapers very frequently (on an average every 3 to 4 hours) as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. It is cheaper for more diapers and I thought it was a good deal but you get what you paid for. I don't understand why so good quality name Pamper brand started producing so poor quality product. I am no longer ordering this product."
2203,0,"This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund."
9718,0,"I was excited to come across Lene Gammelgaard's book as I love to read about women who share my taste for adventure. Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has ""been a journalist,"" unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing."
15081,1,"Incredible Band !! Incredible performance !! Being a long time PROG fan...Dream Theater, Rush , P Tree, Tool..etc... I love this DVD/Blu-Ray...Looks and sounds great on my new 59"" plasma.. Get it, You won't be disappointed. !! TV not included..sorry.."
8346,1,"Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."
15476,0,"i have a friend who loaned me a copy of this book and insisted i read it and spread the word... thank god i didn't spend money on it. the stories seem forced, almost like they were taken from real life experience and then re-told in such a way as to make them thoroughly unbelievable. i hope that the essays aren't all autobiographical, because they seem to come from a core of desperation that is just painful to read. this guy has potential but really needs to find his own voice and stop trying so hard... i might give his sophomore effort a try (if there is one) but i wouldn't waste the moolah on this one"
10145,1,"She's ""got the beats to make ya burn"" - This is the future of Hip Hop. These 10 songs (plus a ""hidden"" bonus track) are fascinating and fun. The ""extra"" re-release track ""U.R.A.Q.T."" samples the theme of TV's ""Sanford & Son"". My favorite tracks are ""Hombre"", ""10 Dollar"", and the steel-drum laden ""Bingo""."
3933,0,This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
19904,1,"just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me."
13995,0,"If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
15202,0,"C.S. Lewis has to be rolling over in his grave, as this pathetic adaptation abandons his story early on and turns into a smarmy, boring CGI exercise. Pointless battles, pointless special effects, flat characters, ridiculous dialog and no sense of wonder at all. The film invents half baked soap opera subplots that go nowhere. I can't imagine a worse film adaptation. Prince Caspian is the weakest of the Narnia books, but it is a jewel compared to this dreck."
264,0,Strange analogy on death. I tried to go find good in this rambling read but non exist. No need to bother.
12192,0,"Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there."
9491,0,"This movie was terrible. No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either."
19575,1,"I read this book years ago when it was newly published. I passed it around from friend to friend until my copy disappeared. I consider it the best psychological thriller of all. Thanks,Amazon"
11885,1,"I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's ""Foundation series"" novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but ""Foundation and Empire"" moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."
18928,0,"Sometimes being ""original"" isn't necessarily better. Now don't get me wrong... I love this opera and grew up watching it on tv as did many reviewers.. But I'm not wasting my money on a black and white early tv video. What I am hoping for is a DVD of the wonderful video filmed on location in Israel with Theresa Stratas as the mother. I saw this the first time on PBS circa 1979, and was able to find a video tape produced by VAI. However it is time for a release of that performance on DVD. If I want to hear the original cast, I have the cd of that performance."
15738,1,"An inspiring depiction of a woman. I received this from my mother in Junior High School, I only read this recently. I wish I had read it sooner. I have sent this series to all my friends. I can't wait for the next book!"
13422,1,"A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog."
18453,1,"Great spare power supply, the only con' is the excess of weat generated when you use it for a long time... but works great!"
19502,1,"I also found this $75 book to be more valuable than a $1000 ""No Pass No Pay"" Family Medicine Review Course. While that review course really delivered excellent information, little of it actually appeared on the exam. In contrast, this book contains questions very close to what you actually see on the test. Sure there are little mistakes and some annoying repetition of topics but nothing any of us could not get beyond. If you are not doing general geriatric and pediatric care or obstetrics, this book serves as a great starting point to explore the latest thinking. Similarly, if you don't do primary care, make sure to memorize the USPSTF and ACIP guidelines. Most importantly, do as many questions as you can from the ABFM website. I passed with above average scores but would have done even better if I had reviewed more of their sample questions. Good Luck."
19425,0,"This book did not inspire any white light whatsoever. It starts out as creepy from the very begniing -- starting with a black aith a charcoal drawing of the author's face, which is half shaded in black staring right back at you -- creepiest thing I ever saw. On top of that, you're supposedly praying to God or Creator but he tells you that you have to pray to God calling him by a different name for each prayer-- names which came to him during many many meditations -- I didn't trust this book at all and it was in the trash within 2 days. I'm sorry I ever bought this lousy book."
11078,1,"I found this a very interesting book about all the things we should know before everything became so commercialised! It would be geat to have this indexed to find solutions more readily, but it's still a great read. Lots of practical sense that everyone should read at least once in their lifetime."
14898,1,"A challenging record that's worth the effort. ""Army of Me"" and ""Isobel"" are favorites and the big band arrangements and trademark mysterious weirdness make it stylistically diverse."
2908,0,"Within a few days of wearing this watch the star studs started falling out. A few months after owning the watch the three fell off inside the glass. I barely wore the watch after two studs fell out. It is sweet looking when it first arrives, but keep an eye out for silver star studs falling out if you ever where it."
11108,1,"My kids (kindergarten & first grade) love the Songs 4 Life kids ""Light your World."" The songs are easy to sing along with and the know many of the songs. I found the tempo a little repetitive but I was impressed with the kids' ability to sing along."
4333,0,Beware!!! No text to speech option. Amazon was wonderful and refunded the cost of the book. Amazon has great customer service. I have contacted the author and publisher to voice my option on this matter.
11139,1,"If you deal with ANGER in your life, and who doesn't, this workbook (self-directed study on anger) is for YOU!There are many helpful hints and thoughts, and although they are given in the context of Christianity, I believe almost anyone can benefit.For those on a 12-step program, you will not believe how closely anger and addiction are related. Do yourself a favor and get (and read) this book!"
7301,1,my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her
16369,1,"This is an old school comedy and it is not very well known, but it is a real cute and funny movie, with some wonderful actors doing a great job, a great storyline, and for all the guys some really pretty girls! ;) It is a really great romantic comedy that I highly recomend to anyone who likes this genre!! Out of 5 stars I give it 4 and 1/2."
9433,1,arrived a lot quicker than expected and was in condition that was stated. Thanks and I would buy from again!
322,0,"I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
246,1,"The antenna, while being a bit large, does work rather well. It is highly directional so you will have to move it around somewhat. It is styled well and sturdy. I have it sitting on top of my sat receiver and it looks good where it sits. This antenna, by the way, is built by Winegauard, a longtime American antenna company."
1473,1,"The autobiography of Ben Franklin is a worthwhile read simply because of who Ben Franklin is. It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read."

3863,0,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
8347,0,"Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly. E-mail to company went unanswered, except for auto reply. Phone numbers were always busy. Returned the unit to the store of purchase for a refund."

5917,1,"I am a big fan of the halo video games, and I wanted to know what happened before the first game and in between the games. These books are great novels. I read them all in less than a week. I just couldn't put them down. I was going to buy them from bungie and the were going to be $29 with shipping so I looked around and I found them here for much cheaper. Great books, great price."
10429,1,"Jennifer Love Hewitt did a not-too-bad job in portraying Audrey Hepburn although she was not able to grasp everything about Audrey. Speaking the truth, playing Audrey Hepburn is a gambling, a risky task in every sense. I don't think that there r more than very few ppl who can really carry the mission, and we can't expect that we are going to see a facsimile of the best actress in the Hollywood history. So, at least, we should give Jennifer some applauses for her courage to take the role."
11193,0,What can you say? Doesn't even sound like Queen in some places. A bit too much disco. There are a couple of good songs though. But this is my least liked Queen album apart from Flash Gordon sound track.
16651,1,"I though this cd wasn't bad for a first one. I would too like to hear more of his voice, but it seems that no matter what songs he sings, it can melt you heart. I don't have any kids of my own, but this is the type of cd that anyone at any age can listen to without having to worry about the ratings. Good job. He will just get better and better with more experience.Oh and for those of you who are looking forward to Ruben's cd, I heard rumors about it that I'm not sure are true, but many of you might be dissapointed in that one too. I heard it was going to be alot of hip hop type songs and not the soul songs that everyone is expecting. I hope this is not true, but if the cd is anything like the song he sang at the concert, it will definately be more hip hop."
8808,0,If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. Over singing and generic guitars make for a bland album. Just my opinion.
14578,0,"A mediocre performance by a professional pianist. By playing the 3rd movement of Mozart #23 without looking the CD label, you would think this could be a pretty good amateur young player performing at a local winning concert.

10405,0,"I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."

8713,0,Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
4466,0,"Thank You Brokaw's generation for winning the war that should have been won (though without the A-bomb), and then sending us into Korea, and Vietnam, and Iraq, and Iraq again (and still) and Afghanistan (not a war of necessity, please read more than the mainstream media) just to name a few. You insult us all, even you own generation."
11452,0,"I don't know why, but this movie disturbed me. Perhaps it was the concept of the film. Or me imagining that happening to me what was happening to Drew Barrymore's character. Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work. And the parts that were supposed to be funny, really weren't. It was all kind of desperate actually."
18728,1,"but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair."
4316,0,"This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."

17147,1,"George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."
899,0,"For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."

BAD DECISION.. not soft at all and they leak after one hour of wearing them, terrible.. and they are smaller than cruisers so they don't fit well.. DO NOT BUY"
9117,1,"My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."
9020,0,"I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice."

They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
14370,1,"I went ahead with the ""subscribe and save"" for this item, the savings are great! Pampers is a great product and couldn't believe how much I would save for something I need to get anyway. The only drawback is that my 2nd shipment was returned by the carried without any explanation. I never received it and had to re order it again!"
11933,0,"I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!"

11791,0,"when Clay Aiken is freed from his American Idol contract and gets to do some real music.The only cool songs on this album are This is the Night, No More Sad Songs, and I Will Carry You. For the most part though, this album is a mixture of bubblegum pop and Broadway - ...which should never be mixed because everyone knows Clay Aiken dosn't want to be a pop star/teen idol. I don't believe his real fans want him to be one either."
15732,0,"I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling. I think it's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano, instead."
9324,1,"This series has been around for a while, but it was new to me. I happened to stumble across this book and couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the mystery. It was just very well written and a lot of fun. Great cozy for cozy lovers!"
16740,1,"I had hopes for this one and it delivered. I liked how I was never sure what to expect, even though some elements were typical of suspenseful/horror movies. It was gory enough to make me cringe, and creative in that it isn't an unbeatable super-monster based tale. I like the ending, and would like to see the alternate, as well. Really good stuff!"
3466,1,"This is truly a very wonderful, helpful DVD. I bought it several months ago when it was still too cold to hoop outside. You do need quite a bit of space - probably a good 10x10 area would be enough. I went to a music festival with my hoop after practicing once a week or so for a couple months, and people were amazed that I had just begun hooping! Huge compliment, and a huge endorsement for this DVD.While this is an EXCELLENT way to begin hooping, I highly recommend going to a festival or a class where others are hooping - you will learn the most from watching others!"
5169,1,"This book gave me a overview of tequila that included the agricultural considerations, cultural heritage, and history of mescal de tequila, not just a guide to making margaritas. It is well written with enough detail to satisfy the curious, yet straightforward enough to allow for the average reader. Exceptionally informative book!"

6854,1,"Este libro hace muchas ""revelaciones"". A decir no creo que todas sean ciertas pero si al menos un 40% de lo que dice es cierto entonces vale la pena. Hay especulaciones sobre los actos del Mossad: Que el mossad estab intentando reclutar al chofer de la princesa Diana y Dodi Al Fayed el da del accidente en que murieron, que mataron a Robert Maxwell, que tenian grabadas conversaciones comprometedoras de Bill Clinton para evitar que investigara a un topo del Mossad. Adems nos cuenta hechos conocidos como el rescate en Entebbe, el robo del MIG iran y el asesinato de Gerald Bull.En general, es un libro ameno de leer y haber un alinea especulativa, que de cualquier modo es imposible de comprobar pues ningun gobierno confirmara lo dicho aqu, asi que no es posible saber hasta que punto es cierto lo aqui dicho."
14204,0,"I've read a number of Crusie books, and the first few were enjoyable enough fluff, but then they all started to blend together. This was no differetn The stories and characters are WAY too similar book to book, right down to the physical descriptions and situations they find themselves in, the secondary characters, the settings, and even the way it all ends up.Also, I listened to this on audio book, and for the life of me can't figure out why the narrator assigned Lucy's sister a Staten Island-ish accent. If they're sisters who grew up together, why would one have that accent and the other not? It was so stupid it was distracting!"

10829,1,I loved these shoes when I got them. They Rock. The company Dress Code is great also they were really good to me when I received my shoes unfortunately they didn't fit so I had to return them for a pair one size bigger. Anyway I didn't have the money at that time to send them back right away so I told them I would send them back as soon as I got paid and to my surprise a few days later I received a prepaid return label from them it was great. Now I am able to send them back right away I am very happy with everything.
4951,0,"This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Maybe the worst I've seen so far. I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic. I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative). So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did. Just stick with the DVD. And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann)."

How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."

17174,0,"I don't know why they called this movie Batman. Maybe it should have been called Ninja man. This is not any Batman I know or would want to know. The plot and character development of this film are sorely lacking even for a comic based character- as it relies entirely on non- stop action. I enjoyed action films when Arnold was the big star of the time, but Batman Begins lacks any real excitement and is incredibly over-serious and lacking in humour.Christian Bale lacks any personality as Batman. Michael Keaton was infinitely superior. Bale has no sense of humour, is anything but handsome or physically imposing and someone who is certainly not suited for any leading role other than American Psycho."
17237,1,"This was one of the best books in the discworld series i ever read. The Great God Om, wanting to stir up the belief of his followers, decides to manifest himself. He has taken the form of very majestic creatures in the past but for some reason that even he cannot understand he has now manifested himself as a two pound tortise and cannot even do proper miricles anymore. Finding himself with only one true believer (the others trusting in the Quisition)he must try to find a way, using this beliver as his prophet, to regain proper godship. This will be no easy task because the only person that believes in him is not even a preist and tends a small vegetable garden..."

7396,1,"I purchased this as an extra battery for a Canon sd800is. It is the same as the original battery and is Canon ""branded"". A third party battery is available locally at TWICE the price, and the Canon version for almost three times the price. This is a good buy."
17269,1,"This is a compendium of texts on Compassion beautifully presented in Tibetan and in fresh, excellent translation. Contact with original texts is increasingly difficult for non-scholars in the sea of Dharma publications. This is a model for presentation of traditional texts in a way that is approachable and meaningful for all who are sincerely interested in Buddhism and its deep traditions. Thanks to all who helped to bring it into being."
12849,1,"I have been waiting a long time for this record and although I love Miss Kittin, I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Radio Caroline 1. Although the beats and transitions are not as smooth(as in the former), the cd is good, and its apparent that Miss kittin is exploring her german side.This album's nature as cutting edge electronic music emerges after a couple of listens."

8608,1,"I got this for my 800+ page unbound textbook, and it could easily hold at least 300 pages more. The only problem with it is, because of the size, you cannot put it into a backpack with room for anything else. I ended up having to get a smaller 2-inch binder and put a few chapters at a time in it for easier transportation."
13679,0,"Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie."
5315,1,"I have yet to receive my MOAM + 1 but since I have heard all the songs, I will give this cd a 5 star. I have listened to this cd everyday since its release and I have over 3000 cds. It says something about this cd and that is, it is that excellent."

16087,0,"A solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors. Both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best. If you are averse to dubbing of fictional films, you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous. Clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles. But in the age of DVD it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film."
17366,0,"The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job."
17734,0,"Hello peoples. I recomend not to read this book. As other readers have stated... it was very boring and 500 pages saying "" my life ..."" so you can read this book if you dont already know that life can .... if you dont know that, you should definitly read this book!!! i repeat... this book is very boring... and i dont recomend it!!!!"
8825,0,The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away.
10636,1,"O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
3183,0,"I bought this for my 13-year-old stepson thinking it would be a cool toy. It turned out to just be annoying and he got bored with it in a day. It was way too expensive for what it really is, an annoying noise machine."
6041,1,"I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."
435,0,Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't.
7423,1,"A clean cut album from a TRUE clean cut artist.You can listen to this cd with anyone and not fear the messages like today's music.Each song can fit a person's past or feelings so well. Most of us have endured the hardships, love, and blessings that this young man sings of.Do not be fooled by the bad reviews by the industry paid critics and reviewers. They say this cd is bad because the industry fears Clay and his fans.The music industry says we all want to hear hip hop - rap - sex - infidelity messages. LOL GUESS WHAT??Listen up record producers. If this was true, tell me why Clay Aiken is the hottest thing in MUSIC today, period???His music is outselling ANYTHING put out by 95% of the so called stars today."
13749,0,I was given this book as a gift and as a redhead myself I was excited to read it. All I can say is that I am glad I did not pay good money for it. The writing is so bad and pointless and does nothing to prove a point or even tell a story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!
8531,0,"i heard this cd while hanging out in some cd stores in boulder colorado. over their system it sounded great....kind of a stripped down j.s.blues explosion. i then had several long days of driving to get into it. the more i listened, the less i liked it. now, several months later it never makes it out of my stack of 1500 cds. in fact, i am thinking of moving it to the ever rotating pile of cds to trade. i guarantee that most of you will never listen to this cd more than a year from now....there just isn't enough there to hold one's attention. white guys doing stripped down blues is nothing new or radical or interesting. listen to the originals (hooker, guy, waters, harpo, wells, rev.gary davis, hopkins, wolf....)....they are much more interesting. If white blues is what you crave, search out peter green (hot foot powder) or go for the funkier js blues explosion (completely unlike the other artists i mention above)."
15693,1,"I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . This is the exact same one that comes with the camera , and the shipping was fast too."
11611,1,"I was in the process of getting rid of a few old cds to make room for new ones. This got my attention since i did not play it that much when i first got it. The fact that this has Nguyen Le on guitar sort of sends this to dynamic, electrified and 'swing & be bop'' influenced territory. I know some of Fresu's work tends to be a bit calm. And although there are contemplative pieces here the 'fast' ones are the ones that really catch your attention as they are played SO well. Kept my attention all the way through. Eclectic, European 'Ecm - tinged' and very slight fusion tracings makes for a very interesting and joyful listening experience. Excellent sound too! Guess i won't be selling this one any time soon."
2950,1,"Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat."
10390,1,Great book for first time Bowers. Very easy to read. Ready to try my first bow hope all goes well
11110,1,"I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
10841,0,"Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!"
19632,0,"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
1255,0,Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
7391,1,"This soundtrack is one of the best classic television scores I have heard. It contains such classic tracks heard on the A Team as ""move sucka"" and ""taxi chase"".

5303,0,"Clay has an amazing voice! and I voted for him on AI, but this album just doesn't makes him justice, yeah this songs, well some of them have meanning and thats great but the beat and just the flow of the album is way too slow(and I love ballads and slow stuff also fast stuff) and this kind of pop music trying to be contemporary is just not for him, he is a true sing a true artist and he has an amazing beautiful voice, but this album is just not for him, maybe 'Invisible"" I think it's the only one that kinda makes him jsutice but the rest no, sorry Clay I'm sure you'll make it huge with ur next album."
18566,0,it doesn't get hot enough and has much less wattage than my old one. Where can I find one a better one???
13698,1,"It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
17050,0,"I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on....

15761,1,"DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies."
9684,1,"I really liked this film. It combines musical film with 1950's mystery. It's a fresh take on an old plot. It was also cool to see so many great French actresses in the same movie. Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, and Fanny Ardant steal the show, but all eight actresses turned in a nearly flawless performance. There are a lot of family secrets revealed along the way and the intricacies of the characters are played well. The ending is typically European but not an unfamiliar device to American theatre patrons."
19684,1,This is a splendid collection from a great Jazz piano master who is able to cross over into more popular forms without losing the depth and integrity of his inimitable style. Ramsey Lewis and his wonderful trio are national treasures.
1149,0,"It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
19834,1,"This stuff really helps improve your CM if you need a little help in that area. I'm on Clomid which unfortunately dries you out and I had heard of EPO on a forum I frequent. I took one pill with my mother meds after dinner and could already see an improvement by that night. The next day my CM was creamy, and without the EPO I would have been dry or sticky at best. By the third day I was borderline wet/creamy. I'm only on CD6 now and didn't ovulate until CD20 last cycle so I imagine by the time I need fertile CM it won't be an issue."
11852,1,"First let me say that I've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent. This scale agrees with the one in my doctor's office, so seems to be accurate. If you get off to re-weigh yourself, it will give you the same result again. You won't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale, or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot, so it is consistent. It could be a little sturdier, but it's fine for home use. We've had it for at least a year or two with no problems. I give it 5 stars for home use."
11460,0,"Worst band ever, period. The final sign that the music industry cares not for talent. Basically like the fabricated Spice Girls only they could at least carry a tune. These guys can't even play a radio, just horrible. One catchy song that was ridiculous in the first place and even at that there was proof because it was only in regular radio play for about 5 weeks. Loserville has a soundtrack and it is sang by chump a whumpa!!"
1597,1,"This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie."
16083,1,"100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. Throughout the history of this one family, it is hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction. The best comparison would be to ""Big Fish"" in which the stories are tall-tales, but yet not without fact. All in all, I recommend this book to everyone."

15421,1,"By now you've probably watched season one at least, so I'm not going into a story line. The romantic side of this story gets a little sappy as part of the overall pulling of all of the story lines together. Part of the entwined past coming together ending was foreshadowed in S2 Pt1 with Odin, the First Fist. While it does pull together, it's rather simplistic, predictable and generally unlikely (but that's a writer's stock in trade I guess). Still it does close out the first story arc (assuming they are planning a second). They have left it wide open for another season (or two). All this aside, while not my favorite of the three it is still a good watch and I'd say it was worth the price and time. As a whole the series was good with most areas being above average. May be suitable for teens or even children, but watch it first. We all have different opinions on what's okay for kids."
2400,0,"Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking.

That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."

If liked the first Batmans you'll like this one more. If you like bats, adventure, big tanks, and awesome sequences this is the movie for you."
2228,1,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Sonoma. I was pleasantly shocked! I couldn't believe how many crazy things were happening, and it just kept getting crazier and crazier. From the beginning of the movie there is no way to prepare for the turn that the movie takes. The situations that the obsessed Moz fan gets herself into are both hilarious and disturbing. And all the supporting characters were wacky too. What kind of twisted mind made this flick? While it didn't leave me feeling warm and fuzzy, it definitely left me with a smile."
19293,1,"I already had this title on standard DVD (single disc), but I couldnt pass up the opportunity to get this on Blu-ray when Amazon dropped it to 11.99. I wasnt going to replace any of my standard DVD discs with blu-ray versions as the upconversion displays them well enough. But upon seeing Batman Begins in blu-ray, I was confident that the 12.00 was worth it. Excellent 5-star transfer."
7739,1,A good book for Self-Defense folks. I was hoping for something new but it pretty much reiterated what we already know (preaching to the choir). Not a bad evening read.
8905,0,What a waste of paper. Nothing useful in here at all. This is more for a third grader than an adult taking a college course. Find a better book or you will be sorrowfully disappointed.
14486,0,"This kit has a building diagram for only 1 project and that diagram was so poor that my husband who played with these kkits as a kid in the 60s (yes they have been around that long) couldn't easily figure it out - and he rarely has trouble figuring out anything. Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions. I encourage the manufacturer to do so."
4386,1,"I love Pampers, they definitely do not last the 12 hours they say they will. I have to change my kids in the middle of the night sometimes because they wake up soaked. My one child just turned 1..and the other just turned 2. The diapers work A LOT better than other brands I have tried. I was a Luvs fan until they changed and they just weren't as good anymore :( so back to Pampers I went."

18800,0,"This DVD is a compilation of short excerpts from Christmas themed Veggietales videos. Some of the ""songs"" aren't even complete songs, just a portion of another video that has singing. A lot of cutting and pasting different scenes together to make a ""complete"" song. Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a ""sing-a-long"" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos. My daughter loves the traditional Veggietales videos but lost interest in this within minutes. The very end of the DVD has 3 traditional Christmas songs that simply play the music and scroll the words across the screen karaoke style with a still background. Disappointed in this product from Veggietales."
15675,1,I purchased the paperback version instead of the Kindle version because it was $5 less from Amazon. That is the reason for removing one star. I have just started reading the book and appears to be worth the read hence the 4 stars.

13159,1,Excellent case! It comes in handy once a month for lan partys due to the carrying harness. Not to mention the weight will not break your back compared to other cases.I have owned SFF (Small Form Factor) machines in the past but I have to admit nothing beats the cooling and hardware upgrade potential of the Antec Super Lanboy.
14324,1,"ok so I haven't had the squeem for too long to give a long term review (just received today) but I can say that it is torture just putting it on! It took me a full 30 minutes to fasten all the hook and eye closures and adjust it. With that being said, it looks very promising and am excited to see what it does in 30+ days of full time wear. Very excited. I do like it so far (the few hours I've been wearing it)"

14872,0,"Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion ""Lex Luthor"" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"
13883,1,"Once again, Versus is able to capture the very essence of what indie-music is about. In the ""Afterglow"" ep, the band proves their competency in their ability to write unforgettable songs. This proves that you just can't buy any old Fender Mustang Guitar, vintage Twin-Reverb Amp, or analog delay pedal and expect to be a musician. Versus proves that they are real muscians."
6129,1,"This is a technical analysis book, focus on mainly chart pattern and channel lines.I bought the 5th edition and 7th edition on E-Bay.The chapters written by Bassetti simply doesn't match the quality of Edwards and Magee original books.If I had a preference I would choose first the 5th edition first and next I would choose the 7th edition.I returned the 8th edition back to the bookstore for a refund."

11334,1,"First of all let me say i really enjoyed this movie. Not like a regular slasher. Its very good. I actually seen it at the show. Now the main difference that no one has listed out of all these reviews is, just the ending. I didnt see any more gore than was at show. Something unrated doesnt always mean extra gore or sex. Anyway just the ending is different than one that was seen in US theatres. I wont spoil ending for you if you havent seen, but most know from youtube what its really suppose to be. Anyway pick this movie up and add it to your collection. Its a keeper!"

11049,1,"What I consider one of the greatest descriptive writers in the Western cannon, Chandler can transport you in to old Los Angeles. Every story will make you crave a stiff drink and perhaps even leaving a smell of tabacoo in your clothes. I recomend these stories to people who want to understand LA better because Chandler caught the essence of the city that can even be seen today. Look down the 2nd street tunnel at 2 am and see that barrel of a gun or drive to the Rosebowl and see why he makes reference that there are no sidewalks in that wealthy neighborhood. If you want to learn about noir, there is a reason Chandler is considered one of the fathers."
16409,0,"As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."

It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up."

11238,0,"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."

63,0,The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.
758,1,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
12128,0,"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."

13788,0,"""Under The Tuscan Sun"": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."
10984,0,"This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
4986,1,"The Oginski's style is very similar to the Chopin's. Well, they were both Polish and created in the same era. However I think I even prefer Oginski. I only wish that CD encluded the most famous Oginski's Polonaise: ""Farewell to the Fatherland"" (""Pozegnanie z Ojczyzna"")."

11545,1,"I love Jules Verne's writing. This book is small enough to fit in a purse or glove box so you can take it with you anywhere. If you like steampunk fiction, or old west, read some Jules Verne"
12923,0,"""The Greatest Generation"" has an admirable goal, but falls short due to the author's heavy-handed attempts to hammer his point in.Tom Brokaw correctly recognizes the World War II era generation as one deserving of our gratitude and praise, and his approach to this subject is commendable. Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes."
4507,1,"We took this bed camping, and it was very comfortable to sleep on. It did lose some air overnight, so we just reinflated before going to bed. Great mattress for the price!"
4181,0,"There are a few decent things here, for example the author's idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the reader Wall Street ""secrets"", and not enough hard analysis. And even the inventory metaphor falls down: Good stock picks should increase in VALUE, not just in price. And if they do increase in value, and the price does not get too far ahead of the value, they should not be too quickly sold."
16420,1,"Even for someone who wasn't a huge fan of the show, this movie is a must see. Clever story, great flick!"
2500,1,"works fine. Easy to install. Discreet. Directions were easy to understand. We got this because we have a gas fireplace and wanted to be safe. I ordered a battery operated alarm because I wanted more options of where to place it other than being commited to an electrical outlet. However, what was shipped was the electrical kind. I decided to keep it because you know the hassle of returning wasn't worth it and it does it's job."
3418,1,Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
1294,0,"I bought this because my wife had surgery and needed something to use in the shower to reach parts she couldn't bend to get to. The brush cannot handle water very well. It started to get funky and peel and became useless within a month. I guess if one completely dries it off after every use and hangs it in the open air to continue drying, it might last longer and be useful. If you hang it in your shower, though, it turns into some germ ridden piece of junk in no time."

5725,1,"Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film."

3113,0,"Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
6972,0,"This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW."
397,0,"I was completely disappointed in this ""film.""This film was LITERALLY put together by Spongebob Squarepants studio assistants and was a complete waste of my evening. Not funny, not humerous (other than 4 lesbian high-schoolers and the main character's ex-boyfriend who is friggin' hilarious in the few scenes he is in), and nauseatingly slow-paced.I won't go into a long description, but essentially, some girl is totally obsessed with Moz and stops by some of his old haunts in an effort to find and marry him. She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it. You will be disappointed. And remember, MOZ IS NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!"

4990,1,"I was worried this adapter might be different than the others I have seen on the internet or in stores, because it was about $20 less than what seemed to be the going rate. Have no fear, this is the one that will work with your Tivo.It was easy to hook up - just plug the USB into your Tivo unit and follow the setup instructions (on screen in the Tivo Setup menu); I was up and running in about 5 minutes.Signal strength is a little bit less than what i get with my new laptop - My new laptop gets about 65% signal sitting on my bed, this gets about 53% from the same room. But, it's certainly acceptable for downloading program guides and swapping shows with my other Tivo. With a wireless-g network I can transfer an hour TV show in about 15 minutes, and much faster than real time. If I wait about 30 seconds to start playing after I start transferring, I find that I can FF through all the commercials."
3937,0,"I was disappointed.My wife, who is the big stargate fan, was also. She watched it a second time and said she was glad she bought it ... after being really disappointed on the first viewing.If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw. It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.Anyway, glad to give my opinion for what it is worth.Save your money for something that is worth watching."

6787,0,"When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA."
9073,1,I was looking for a shower door that could open from either the left or the right and I did not want one to choose for me. This door ticks and fits all the right boxes in that department. I like the crystal glass effect too. It is very clear and allows a lot of light into the shower hub. It is frameless too which is what was asked for by the wife.Its sturdy quarter of an inch thick glass also is a nice feature. But most of all the pivot door is a feature I got on with too.
3321,1,"WOW ! Batman has finally arrived on the big screen.This movie really deserves a sixth star for sending all previous versions to an early retirement and hopefully their final resting place.Try to forget all the goofy,spoofy and fluffy batman movies of the past - this one finally tells the story the way it was intended, dark with realism so long over-due that it will have you believing in heroes again. A must see movie that will entertain adults as well as children. I was absolutely convinced that Christian Bale is Batman - SUPERB !Buy it!!!"
17464,0,"I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray."
15254,1,"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."

8826,1,"I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring."
19026,0,"To start, I loved the first 4 books. But this was really bad. The characters were very unlikable. Golan was a child hating old grump and Bliss almost broke down in tears every time she stepped on a blade of grass. The same arguments over and over, no action and then he had to throw in a sex, like it's mandatory for the hero to sleep with at least one woman per planet visited or something. Yuck! This and _Prelude to Foundation_ should have never been written or at least cut down to a reasonable size. Each book could have dropped about 150 pages with absolutely no effect on the plot. If you really want to find out what happens, do the abridged version on tape and save yourself from this trash."

1841,1,"I have to admit I'm a recent fan of the Black Crowes and ""By Your Side"" was their first complete album that I listened to, but not the last. Because of this I album I got everything that they have ever released and I have to say, this one is definately their best. From ""By Your side"" to ""Go Tell the Congregation to ""Virtue and Vice"" there is not a minute of music on this album that does not rock. I read a biography of the band at the Apple music store and that writer said it best, ""This album is Criminally Under-Rated"". If you're a Black Crowes fan then you'll love this album."
7110,1,"I had no problem setting times and days for the unit to run it is so easy, I have also purchased 2 of the double outlet timers of the same make so that did make easy for me to set the single timer.

3486,1,"In this innovative novel Wyndham faces todays most intrusive problem, old age, and its cure. A good example of one of the first science fiction novels that aren't merely a diversion but also a peek atthe moralities that might follow those discoveries that at the moment only exist in our imagination. Even though the end is a disappointment, it is appropriate for those who love science fictionas well as those who have under-rated this expanding corner of fiction."

I have used these diapers in varying sizes since day one without any problems (except that they cannot handle all the urine of a 2 year old overnight). I never had rash problems that I can attribute to these diapers."

16746,1,I'm glad that L. J. Smith finally put a witch book in her series. I love vampires but it wouldn't really be good if that's all she wrote about in the Night World series. Now she needs to put in a shapeshifter novel and she'll be on a roll. The only thing I don't get about the book is why Thea got expelled with Blaise when she didn't do anything. I hope she became a famous vet.

Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
307,0,"'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
803,0,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean movie that I could enjoy watching. However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of ""If it feels good, do it."" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."

Plus, even though my baby sleeps through the night , when I used this diaper, she woke up at 2:30am all WEAT. I called the Pampers costumer service and they offered me a $5 coupom...........yes, I could not believe it, at last they offered a $10 coupom, so I'll still need to spend monwy on it? I hopped to have at least a size 4 sent to me. Be carefull, those diapers can work for you, but be concious that whenever you need the costumer service they will not replace the diapers.Not buying Pampers agin........by the way, seventh generation and Huggies are far better!Viviane"
16175,0,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
13849,0,This book needs a serious revision. There are many current Catholic doctrines and practices that are not addressed (i.e. why no married priests in the midst of such a serious shortage?). I would not give this to a person considering becoming catholic or someone who has questions because current issues are not dealt with well.

Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth.

11437,1,"I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection.

18713,1,"I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."

Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."

He doesn't play Holmes well at all and the action in them is slow and stagey. Even the damn credits take too long to roll at the beginning. Mothers, tell your children not to do what I have done--SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Richardson seems like a natural for this role, but it's a disappointment."

The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"

SO, two stars."
7489,0,"I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."
15774,0,"I love Pamper's Swaddlers. I've tried Huggies and both Pampers brands, and out of all of them Swaddlers are my favorite. That being said, the Baby Dry diapers are terrible. With Swaddlers you can adjust the fit, and the diapers are really soft. Baby Dry diapers feel like they're recycled and and I really dislike the sticky waist straps. They're shorter so you can't adjust the fit as easily, and the waist is always loose--with a boy that's a very bad idea because he tends to get his clothes wet through the TOP of the diaper instead of the sides now. I can't wait until we use these up because I will never buy Baby Dry again."
3929,1,"I almost didn't buy this book because it had Christmas in the title and I supposed it would not have much in the way of the pagan holiday. I was very wrong. This is the best book I have ever read on the solstice. It tells of celebrating Yule before Christianity abducted it. ""The Winter Solstice"" has the look of an arty, coffee table book but it is definitely worth the read. It offers a couple of small rituals and some great phrases for ceremonies. It is more of a scholary history than a magickal book. I cannot wait to read it again next December to get me in the Yule spirit!"

However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers. Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music."

My wife, who loves vampire stories probably even more than I do, had never read the book and when I went about trying to find a copy of it for her, it seemed impossible. Thank god for the internet (and to a lesser extent, Amazon). I was finally able to get a used hardback for a sum that wasn't too insulting. My wife tore through it and loved the weirdness as much as I do. It is crazy that this book has not had a recent reprint. Who ever is responsible for that should be slapped once or twice."

The fact that he was comfortable with this awful role says enough about the kind of man he was.

The story and soundtrack couldn't even come close to saving this trash either."

Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap. The Vietnam portion was helpful as well, but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country. I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition, which is *really* outdated."

I think that older people should read this book and not young kids."

Right after the first track, ""Prison Song"", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was.

Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories.

This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs."

THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows.

10634,1,"I was amazed by this book: The author, while travelling from Central America to Canada provides evidence for North America being colonized by Egyptians, Chinese, Phoenecians and other ancient civilizations. The most amazing part of the book was the story of an Egyptian city in the Grand Canyon. Childress reproduces the actual Arizona newsclippings from 1909. Like his other books, this one is richly illustrated, far-out and fun to read!"
10929,1,"All in all this game is amazing!!!I'm sure all yuo old school sega fans out there know what I'm talking about. The ground breaking genre defining Guardian Heroes!orgionally, the first Guardian Hero game came out on the legendary sega saturn and there was and still is nothing like it. If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game! It was a bit sad to know that they've all died, but it was absolutely a must for the developing storyline.If you've played the first one I'm sure you'll agree the way the story goes is PERFECT! I wish I could give this game 10 stars...Long Live Prince Valgar!!!"
13399,1,"What a hoot! I've been a fan of these guys from the beginning, through thick and thin, and this set captures a truly remarkable performance. My only complain is that the audio quality seems to take a dump in the end of disc two. Geoff and Pamela sound way overmodulated, and the weird blurry effect that distorts the image of the two is distracting.The best parts? ""Suite Sister Mary"" from OMCI and ""Fear City Slide"" from OMCII.Awesome stuff!"
13747,0,"Damn i hate all theese courney rappers,especially Nelly.Suit sold better than Sweat,but there were only 2 videosfor suit,one of them were over and over that video didn't getthat many plays.Why didn't he just do that last year....Dummy.And that new single,Grils that song sucks the beat is lamethe video sucks,and nelly's trying to bring the jewell and platinum thing back to rap.When every boby know's that ""Bling Bling"" is played out,Nelly had nothing but a fake grill and gay parts,anybody who likes Nelly is a square. If you already got sweat and suit you don't need this record. if you just want the song Grills or the hits of both albums than it's for you, but i don't see the point in all this southern rap crap.If you are fed up with rap now a dayz than listen to punk,alternative rock.And if you want good videos,watch fuse,IMF'smtv2,not that mtv pop or BET crap."
19979,0,Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals. What was one of the best concert videos that I had ever seen and heard was ruined by someone who thought he could improve on perfection. Don't waste your money if you've seen the original.
19959,1,"This CD is the bomb. GET IT! It's much more organized than the first. Garbage is unique, compared to other bands. I love this CD. It is my life. HELP I""M A SHIRLEY MANSON WANNABE! I love you garbage!! I'm telling you guys, if you don't get this, you are missing out on SOOOO much!GET IT!"
14875,1,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
15640,0,"After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a ""menu decoder"" when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books. Try to find something else."
18347,1,My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!
2699,0,"I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"
12772,0,"I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book."
18946,0,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."

2442,1,"I have to say, I too am one of Clay's ""older"" fans. (Just under 38). He has been labeled as a broadway kind of singer, and the tunes he sang on American Idol were true Clay (belt-em-out) style. I don't hear this on this album. I do like the album, but it wasn't what I expected. I would love to see him do another album, maybe of some show tunes or the like. Don't get me wrong, I could listen to him sing everyday, all day. It just doesn't get any better than that voice... Would love to see Solitaire on the next one. Also got to say I'm loving the articles. Way to go for standing up for yourself and who you are, even though I loved the belly shot on Rolling Stone. I do give you some serious credit. Fighting the big boys can't be easy. Keep the albums coming."

11965,0,"Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
10287,0,"Having been a satified customer of Tivo almost since it's inception...I was blindsided by them when my cable company switched to digial service, doing away with all analog signals. Tivo did not notify customers and have not addressed the issues on their web page. Soooooo.....save yourselves a whole lot of headaches and hair pulling. Don't buy this unit. Also consider before you buy the upgraded models with cable card readers....because I have researched this and have found that there are lots of problems with the cable cards. You have to have your cable company install them, which you will be charged for and there is a monthly fee for the cards. When I called and cancelled my Tivo service, the rep offered me an upgrade model for $99.00.....this should have been an upfront offer to all of those, like myself who purchase the Series 2 dual tuners with the good faith that the service would always be available. Shame on Tivo!"
14289,0,"I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain."
16561,1,"if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
7129,1,"This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain."
19451,1,"I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing ""Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather"". Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand"
11137,1,This is a good product as it helps me keep a better grip on the PDA. It would have been a lot better though if it fit a little more tightly.
3568,1,"Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. ""Special"" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), ""Push It"" and ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."
15218,1,"This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend."
19654,0,"This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak."

3985,0,"I went through three of these, neither one of them would maintain the air pressure and would slowly deflate. This occurred within 2 uses for each of the 3 mattresses i had. I considered maybe the person sleeping on it was too heavy, but alas, the person is 210 pounds and the weight limit is 300, so that wasnt it. I thought maybe it was punctured, but if it was the person would have awoken on the floor instead of on a supper jeloutnous rubber blob, so that was not it either. What conclusion left is there- this thing sucks and doesnt maintain the air."

3180,1,"My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good."
893,0,"Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
4900,0,I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price.
9111,1,This movie is the best Jet Li martial arts flick I have ever seen. The story starts out with action and leaves you wanting more. The little bit of disappointments were that its subtitled and some parts are unreadable & that the ending left me hanging. From beginning to end it was great. I even tried getting the DvD version but it got put on back order and then never came. If you like this movie you might also want to try The New Legend of Shaolin.
12690,0,"The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that."

4853,1,I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered.
17657,0,"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
14098,1,"Asimov wrapped up the Foundation/Robot/Empire saga quite well in Foundation and Earth. I must admit I was a bit confused by the book as I read the Foundation series starting with Foundation before I read any of the Robot/Empire Novels or even Prelude to Foundation or Forward the Foundation. Despite my confusion, I was impressed with the book even then."

8552,1,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new ""cartoony"" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.This ""special edition"" DVD is very dissapointing in the way of extras though, with no features of any kind, not even a trailer! This could be forgiven if the sound and picture quality wasn't so shoddy! Thankfully, a re-release issue will be out later this year...."

17606,0,"This movie is essentially a 2-hour fight scene with about 20 minutes of half-interesting dialogue and story sprinkled in. Terribly violent and uninteresting. Honestly the most fighting I have ever seen in any movie (including Matrix Reloaded). I wholly regret the $1.99 I spent to rent it. Unless you want to see endless stabbings and blunt force traumas, do not see this movie."

10346,0,This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference).
3491,1,This scale is great. It is very accurate and is also accurate for repeatability. It's easy to read. It came mostly assembled. I only had to screw 2 parts together.I would highly recommend it for anyone that wants accuracy to a quarter pound.

12956,1,"For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"

3819,1,"I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."

Since I did not carry this burden, I was able to enjoy Constantine on its own, no preconceptions or rules. This movie rocks, plain and simple, and all of the ignoramus who insist on the ""adaptation"" label will surely fail to judge it on its own right.I am not a comic book fan, and I did not read any of the ""HELLBALZER"" (as a so-called fan of the comic books mistakenly typed, TWICE). I enjoyed ""Constantine"". And as for those who also did, kudos. Don't let the comic book crowd make you feel any less. After all, their limitations and views are theirs alone to suffer..."

Even my husband - who isn't necessarily ""into"" Celtic type music truly enjoyed the concert. I purchased her CD at the concert which she graciously signed for me. It is wonderful! ! Something that I will be listening to for a long time to come. I will also be looking forward to her next CD to see how she has grown with her music. I hope that people will give her Cd a try.

Movies are almost always difficult to be made and expressed in the same way as are books, but the awesome Christopher Walken pieces it together in the most brilliant way. His acting is superb. To see Christopher Walken portray the full range of emotions that overtakes an abductee such as Whitley Striber is to see his greatest acting skills ever!Make no doubt about it, Communion brings forth to the attention of everybody watching it, the fundamental questions of life that we have all been looking for."

To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit."
15276,0,"I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."

This terrorisom against us as a country makes us just as good as those that contributed to the war efforts of WWII. I am taken aback as Brokaw decided that in his godly manor that his father, and his fathers friends were the numro uno. Every generation has its fair share of heros it is horrible to pinpoint one generation to this and cover up what really needed to be said, that we lost thousands of men and women to a cause that needed to be fought. But recent events change the outlook of WWII, September 11 has shown the world that we as a country not a generation are the greatest, WE as a country not singled out retired folks who did do a great job, but in the book it failed to show the real deal it glossed over too much."

(Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler."
17733,0,"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"
11254,1,"Living outside of San Antonio and having friends involved in this project, I remember these kids being here and having prayed for them. I was not expecting to ever see the inside of the stories unfold. My heart is changed forever. Watching the anguish and the joy of these families who are trusting that these Americans are going to heal their children is overwhelming. The beautiful hospitality of the people who opened their homes to these families was deeply inspiring. Their faith in Christ is shown in this remarkable way that leads these Buddhist families to trust in Jesus Christ and to trust and thank Him. I cannot recommend this to you enough. Please watch it. Be challenged from your complacency and moved to heal the broken hearted. Be warned. If you are a parent, this will make you want to go to your children and embrace them.This dvd was graciously provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for review."

1334,0,"I purchased this toolkit from Amazon along with a very high quality Wiha nut driver set (26592). As others have stated, the nut driver is not reversible. It looks to me like the single nut driver is designed to fit both a 2.2 hex nut and a 2.2 - 2.5 star hex nut.However, the Phillips screwdriver is a size 0, and the Costco reading glasses I have that have screws takes a #1 Phillips head screwdriver. The one in this kit is too small.In addition, the Costco reading glasses that I have which have a nut (Design Optics Slim Elite), use a 3.0 mm nut.Don't purchase this for Costco reading glasses.I gave the product a single star because of the misleading description which implies two nut drivers. The single, combo nut driver looks very roughly made compared to the Wiha tools."
8538,1,"I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book."
19113,0,"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."
13914,0,"I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc."

Man this is a classic from the 70's...! a gem from Black Sabbath's vol 4 and I can't understand why Ozzy and Co (Sharon Obsbourne of course) can take a song like this to ruin and destroy it like a pop trash on the voice of this little stupid girl called Kelly (yes with Ozzy but ...) And all for money.If you want to hear the real thing go for Vol 4!

They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."

17969,1,"This is a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work."

4259,1,This is a pretty good product. It fit nice and tight in the doors of my 2003 Accord without having to drill any holes. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to do some customization to get a tight seal around the speakers (5 1/4 in).

14695,1,"So many people here have said so many great things about this startlingly original and innovative film that I'll just simply echo it all. From the music, which fits this film better than any soundtrack ever has before (the visual to music rhythm sync job is incredible), to the break all the rules camera work (not a single cross-cut or quick-cut was superfluous!), to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten. For myself, I'd say it's easily among the top 25 of this decade. Yes, it's that exciting, amazing, and original. I don't have a DVD player yet, but this will almost assuredly be my first purchase, even before THE MATRIX."

After careful selection I bought a Buddy that uses magnets to clean bongs. It cost ten dollars. I also bought this book because it looked good. I also bought a book called Hashish. I recommend this book for growing information and Hashish for the history. I enjoyed reading this book at the cup and I am very sure you will also.

1322,0,"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."

11477,1,"This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. I do have all 3 movies on dvd, but this is one film franchise I don't mind double dipping into. The transfers to blu ray are spectacular. Great picture quality, and sound. My only complaint is that the special features for the first 2 films are non existent, but like I said, I have the dvds so if I needed to get my special feature fix then I could just pop those in. If your like me and love these movies, then do yourself a favor and get the set. You won't be disappointed!"

4822,0,"I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."
16853,0,This book is one of the worst I have read!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to read this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple. Only one thing happens in the entire book and that one thing isn't even exciting!

On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy."
7026,1,"Once I picked it up, I found it very hard to put it down again and ended up reading into the wee-hours of the late evenings! Ms. Gossett's storytelling and ability to keep the reader in suspense was amazing! As I was reading it, I felt Ms. Gosssett was there in the room with me telling me a story!I also loved how she craftfully weaved in diversity themes throughout and it was refreshing to read a story based in Cincinnati where I have lived and worked.It was a real treat living out the story plot and trying to play out in my mind - Who dunnit? I was surprised at the ending and with the very last cliffhanger. I truley believe this would make for a great suspense movie and the book is as good as any Grisham novel I've read (and I have read them all!)!Kudos to Ms. Gossett who has ""come into her own"" and deserves so much success with this book!"
16851,1,Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
16505,0,"Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."

The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"

After some troubleshooting and the problem still hadn't been solved, he agreed to send a cleaning kit to me for free (as it was covered by the warrenty). The cleaning kit came and it worked. I've been using the printer for a couple of months after the cleaning, and it's working with no problems. So if you encounter the same problem, try contacting HP.Just like other users have commented, this printer doesn't automatically get the paper, so you have to stay ready by the printer to feed each page. It gets very annoying. The reason I gave it a 2 star is because of it's quality of the printouts. Also, the ink is fairly priced."

Nadel fills in all the blanks that existed from the Rangers formative years, stories that were too sensitive at the time they occurred, i.e. Rogelio Moret's mental illness, something that was never addressed in the papers of the day. I assume the Rangers had a say in the editing of this book and I commend them for not trying to make Nadel whitewash the team's history.This book is where history begins and ends if you follow the Rangers."

10081,0,"....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the ""stories"" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, ""Brillo"" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."

Bose support has offered me two options: repair them for $100 or replace them with QC2s for $188. I consider neither reasonable and unless I can get them repaired for a nominal charge, I will never buy another Bose product."
7296,0,"I didn't buy the printer from Amazon. But because I like Amazon and value its readers is my reason for writing this. The HP Photosmart 2575xi that I purchased was a great machine. However, when you discover its little idiosyncrasies it becomes a royal pain in the neck! The paper feed does not work correctly and I am not the only one that has had this problem. It completely destroyed my faith in HP when techs tell you turn it off 3 times and then what? Send it back...............You have to hand feed like a little baby.........then the paper jam error comes up................wonder what HP Tech's go to school for.......to learn to say turn it off 3 times and unplug it for 10 minutes..........then repeat it...sounds like level I techs on the Internet Providers..........Get your act together HP....................."
2553,0,My son loves Batman and was looking forward to playing with this toy. My son is very bright and we could not figure out how to put this toy together properly. It kept falling apart and the directions were very confusing. Please do not waste your money. I wasted 45 dollars on a toy that I couldn't even put together!
3255,0,"Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess. They are giving way too much talent and class to a film that has none of their qualities.Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle"
3435,1,"I bought Veggietales for the kids, but the whole family (ages 9 through 65) have enjoyed the excellent animation, the silly humor, and the great story telling. Great for getting your kids into the Bible, but if that's not your goal, they will enjoy the message and have a lot of fun."
9953,0,"I'm sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. There are far too many modern pieces by contemporary Jewish composers, many of which would be considered quite out of place in an actual English synagogue service, particularly of the more traditional style. The leading composers of the Anglo-Jewish liturgical tradition such as Samuel Alman and Abraham Saqui are very poorly represented; even Israel Mombach, the English equivalent of Solomon Sulzer or Louis Lewandowski, only has 3 pieces on the album - and only one of those is typical. Finally, several of the pieces are instrumental (for organ) without any singing at all, which has little relevance to the choral music of the album's title.I have heard the Zemel Choir live, and on this CD they seem rather recessed and timid. Overall, a disappointing release."

13643,1,"This book was a really good book. I especially like how it's a sports novel but also explains life lessons. The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends. By: Dominic, A Sixth Grader from Mainep.s. Matt Christopher ROCKS!!!"
16312,1,I would recomend this book to just about anyone. This book was the best book I read in school by far. I really enjoyed this book because the story had alot of detail and action in chapters. It wasnt like most books and drug on forever. This book had several big events happen per chapter which kept me interested in the story the whole time. The story first begins when George and Lennie are on the run from Weed because a woman accused Lennie of raping her. Lennie was accutally just feeling on her pretty red dress. They take a bus to a ranch where they are going to work but the bus driver drops them off way before the ranch. When they finally reach the ranch they meet tons of nice people and some people who arent very nice. They meet the boss's son Curly who does not like Lennie because he is so much bigger than him. Curly and george later on get in a fight and Curly does not win. This book was a very good book and i would recommend it to any high level reader.
16877,0,This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book.
474,1,"These movies are all gems, confirming the great teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Somehow seeing them together never gets old. I also have The Thin Man series on DVD and this is every bit as good. I would have liked to see a few more extras, including commentaries or interviews, but the movies themselves are worth the price. It's a great chance to see lesser known but great films by great stars."

15208,1,"I bought this as a refurbished item and it wouldn't charge the battery if it was plugged into the bottom, only if the battery was detached. Workable but not what I wanted so I called B&D.; They had me try a couple of things and then immediately shipped me a brand new unit and a pre-paid UPS label. The new unit works flawlessly.You get a very bright lantern and 6 LED lights beneath the main bulb, AM-FM radio which works fine, the NOAA weather band is difficult to tune but that's true with any non-PLL tuner. The AC inverter works fine for charging most AC devices, the 12v DC power socket is handy for some devices but the ability to keep the whole thing charged via the included adapter or by hand-cranking is the best feature.I haven't run trials on the duration of the light since we've had no outages this winter but I'll post them when I can."

14315,1,I've been a fan of Freebo's since the days he backed up Bonnie Raitt on fretless bass and blues tuba. I recently had the opportunity to see him playing with Maria Muldaur. I met him after the show and bought his CD based on hearing him perform one tune from it. This CD is a killer! I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock. I hope he has more of this to share with us in a follow on album. This was worth the wait to hear him leading the way! Try it. You'll like it!

12265,0,"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
3964,0,"There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"

11309,1,"Pampers diapers are one of the best I have tried thus far. I had tried Huggies and they weren't as great as I thought that they would be (being a new dad). The Huggies didn't fit correctly for my baby and would create problems for me. Tried to save on some Wal-Mart brand diapers and they just didn't cut it. I could tell right away that the Wal-Mart brand were ""economic"" for a reason, you get what you pay for. Last but not least, I tried a CVS brand I had bought prior to the baby being born thinking, hmmm, I will take advantage of this offer and show my wife what a great dad I will be. Well, I don't think the outcome affected what she thought of me as a dad too badly, but the CVS brand gave the baby a rash. Out of all of the diapers I have tried, Pampers has bene the best, regardless of the style/model of the Pampers diapers. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this brand to anyone."

14381,1,"Batman Begins is my favorite movie of all time. I watched it 10 times in the theater and I am going to buy a big screen tv for the dvd. Every young man should watch this movie as it features an all star father figure cast of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the immortal Liam Neeson. Watch as they mold an angry young man into a legend. Not to be overlooked is rising star Cillian Murphy as he plays the creepy Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow. After the disastrous Batman & Robin in 1997, this is the movie Batman fans have dreamed about for years."
1155,0,"Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
12816,0,"Oh dear, this was such a disappointment. Diana Ackerman spends too much time in pointless shots (looking a river; admiring her own photos from childhood) and has produced a NOVA series that seriously misses the mark. Too little science, too much irrelevant material. While one can certainly connect art and human experience with scientific knowledge about how the brain works, this series didn't do so successfully. If you were hoping to reveal the wonder of the senses for your students, do not buy this series. Unfortunately, I ordered it through an affiliated store with Amazon and they won't answer my queries about whether/how I can return it."

9916,0,"I have to agree with the ""lousy"" review. It seems to be a decent setup,but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available, what is the point? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster ""shutter"" speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture. I wasn't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera, but this was a total loss. Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization?"

My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it.

3930,0,"For a Finance Professor at NYU this book should be an embarrassment. It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."

Blu-ray players are still very costly, so I am very upset."
3222,0,"I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?"

16799,1,"Well, I am biased, as Warren Brandt was my paternal grandmother's brother. I knew him personally growing up and was lucky to inherit his passion and talent for art. This book is a limited edition, and is beautiful from the beginning, as it is bound in a slipcover and is large in size. As for Brandt's work, it ranges in medium from oil to ink to watercolor, pencil and photography. Each subject is captured in a unique way, and each work tells a story, simply by the subject's pose or by the medium used. If you are a modern American art collector, this book is a treasure."
4491,0,"I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"

I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out.

Even though I was changing my son extra time during night and diaper was not really full, he would ended up in the wet bed. I realized it leaks when he sleeps on the side, but it not suppose to happen. I guess I just got defective box. I bought pampers cruisers for overnight use, and used baby dry only for day time.

I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse.

Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks.

The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day."

16512,1,This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.

More experiments with intense, emotional music will be on the next album. If you like this, check out Diary and the Pink Album."
2414,0,"This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"
8371,0,"This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
9584,0,"I like the Mr Coffee cup warmer in most respects. However, a couple of features that are sorely missing and I am surprised that this product can be marketed without them.There is no auto shutoff switch. I have had other cup warmers in the past that would shutoff after an hour. They also had a sensor that would shut off if no cup was present.I have left my cup warmer on with no cup sitting there a burning all night when I was sleeping. How much more would it cost to add these important safety and energy conservation capabilities.I would gladly pay the difference."

She didn't like the collar at first, but I am sticking with it and she is adjusting. It is well made and working out great. It also comes with some training tips that are helpful. I would definitely recommend this collar."

5221,1,I think that this book had great characters with awsome personalitites and description. I loved how the story changed from a college like setting in a university to an adventures setting in the middle of the fiery ocean. The book ended great satisfying the reader(me). I would reccomend this book for anyone ages 10 and up.

7346,1,"This CD is great for some people, but I think a lot of other people are buying it who maybe shouldn't.For the Nirvana fanatic with money, get the full boxed set, you will probably find the DVD and the book to be worth the extra money, even if you don't listen to the added tracks.If you aren't a fanatic, stick with the albums. You will not like the low sound quality of the recordings.Now, for the Nirvana fanatic who's a bit short on cash, but absolutely has to have ""Do Re Mi"" as part of his collection, that's who this is for. ""Do Re Mi"" is an excellent track, one of Nirvana's best...so if you are a serious Nirvana fan, you DO need to have that one."

6648,0,"Be aware these diapers may cause an irritation on sensitive skin, to my son it was like he was burnt on his tummy, genitals and bottom. Each changing time was hell and cries like I was peeling off his skin. I switched for huggies natural cotton and evrything is fine now."
710,1,"I haven't actually read Cienfuegos - yet. However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"
589,0,"Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average ""broadway musical"" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."
11950,1,This book came in excellent condition and arrived on time. it was more than i expected and just what i could hope for. i am very glad i purchased this.
9401,1,All the other statements are true about download speed due to its ability to help in decompressing data. However I have a Mac and you can't do Tivo to Go but over all I think it is very helpful no matter what and I just bought another one for my S3. God Bless Tivo
13912,0,"I order alot of merchandise from Amazon. But will have real reservations about doing so again. This product I did not realize was not from Amazon and so difficult to return I said lesson learned and kept it. But I will think long and hard about using Amazon again. This product was marked with a sticker that said $0.75 I was charged $3 something and then $3 something for delivery and that was suppose to be free. So I paid $7 dollars for a $.075 book. Not happy next Christmas I will just hit the stores and remember this expierence. Before I told friends Amozon is great so guick and easy , now I say watch out what you are getting some things are a real rip off."

1578,0,"Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."

Bart sez: Ay Carumba - Get it man or eat my shorts!"
7802,0,"I bought this book planning on checking the Feng Shui for my house for the year 2002 and find out after reading several chapters that Lillian Too assumes your house was built since 1984 or has had major renovation during this period. If this is not the case then the rest of the book (i.e. the most important part) is totally useless. Buy another book, any book except this one."
13713,0,"Argento used to be one of Italy's best film makers, unfortunately with ""Trauma"", this and ""Phantom of the Opera"" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying"
18973,0,"The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!"
2075,0,"I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story. Throughout the book there's not anything very exciting that the characters say or do. I also thought that the ending was too happy. Every character in the book was very happy at the end and i thought that it was too much. I think that if i were to give this book a grade it would be a C-. And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10. If you like history, romance, and happy endings, then I very strongly recommend this book for you. Otherwise you will most likely find this book very boring."
13290,1,"Pat and Mike is a lovely story of a star athlete, played by Katharine Hepburn, who is discovered by a sport's manager, Spencer Tracy. Hepburn's character realizes that she is going to be watched every minute of every day while in training. This companionship between athlete and manager finally turns to love.In Pat and Mike, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy again play opposite each other. Hepburn also gets to show off the skills in sports and physical agility, which she posesses in real life."
12345,1,"Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL."
14436,0,"When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game."
10456,0,"Watched this some weeks ago and really can't remember it other than to say it was not what I was looking for. Thought it would give more info about how the mind works, diseases of the mind, basic anatomy and physiology but seems that it only focused on a few stories of people with mind issues. More of a bio on those few featured rather than an overview of the mind itself. Returned this one immediately and again got great service/full refund from Amazon.com, thanks!"
7395,0,"This was by far the stupidest movie I've seen this year. Keanu Reeves proves yet once again that he's one of the authors of how to be a one-dimensional actor (see all the usually mediocre movies that he's done, such as Speed or one of The Matrix sequels if you don't believe me), second only to Vin Diesel (TWO DAYS. dUR-HUR-HUR!!1!111!!1!!). OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund."
8694,0,"I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will."
2273,0,"This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
2971,0,"Well many people have made this point. This album was rushed. Clay's voice is just fine, but this album takes no chances. in a word it's ""boring"" It is as vanilla as vanilla can be. Clay and his producers need to remember what got him here..Clay is a soft and easy crooner. What do we all remeber Clay for??? The song,""Don't let the sun go down on me."" Face it Clay, you're the next Barry Manilow...and what's wrong with that? Barry is still touring and his records are still selling. So Clay, take some time, find a good composer like Josh Grobin did and sing what you do best, don't sing what teenagers want because you know what my friend...you're past that."
19388,1,"The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."
7874,0,"I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package. I installed it, I made sure my photos were .jpgs, etc. I mean, I'm not stupid and I can read the simple instructions. It previewed on my computer just fine. I'm running XP-Home. Anyway, I can't burn the CD... it goes through the motions then it gives me one of 4 different reasons it won't burn. I called Tech Support. One guy was really rude, the next guy was good and said he'd send a new installation disk that day. Two weeks later, I got it. Uninstalled the program, reinstalled from the new disk, and OH BOY! A FIFTH ERROR MESSAGE. My computer is new, fast, and has an extra graphics card. 10GB hard drive, 512, the works. I am so sorry I got so excited about this worthless piece of software. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
10227,0,"Being a WWII buff, when I heard about this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. However, shortly after reading the first few stories, I was deeply disappointed. I have utterly lost all respect for Mr. Brocaw's journalistic ability. The book is simplistic (written at about an 8th grade level), repetitive and boring. It feels more like an article from People Magazine than any sort of historical record or work of literature. Devoid of facts and details, it contains very little of anything else.The generation he is writing about deserves a better tribute than this. I suppose it is to be expected that a member of the info-tainment industry would write something with such little substance. I used to be a loyal viewer of NBC News, I think I'll switch that loyalty to Jim Lehrer and PBS."
4432,0,This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read. I do not knowingly purchase anthol;ogies. O would not recomend this book unless yoy want all 3 books in one.
17376,1,"I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."

2537,0,"I was expecting a lot more out of this movie then what I got.It's basically about a girl who lost her short-term memory in an auto-moblie accident and some guy tries to get her to fall in love with him, yadda, yadda, yadda...There was a lot of jokes that fell flat on their backs' in this movie, after awhile it really begins to annoy you.The acting is nothing great and the diolouge is flat-out horrible.Sandler doesn't give a good performance and Barrymore is okay.Basically, it's a repeatitive movie that delivers lame jokes and the same thing every ten minutes.If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere.This is a very lame, unfunny, boring and stupid movie. Save your money for something worthwhile."
5427,0,"Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch ""The House On Haunted Hill"" (1999) or ""Thir13een Ghosts"" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"
11295,1,"I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it. I think it would have been even better if he had gone with them to save the world at the end, but regardless of that I still have to give the movie 5 stars."
