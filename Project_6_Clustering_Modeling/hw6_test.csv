3,"No desire to visit mother in jail, am I a bad person?
My mother has been in and out of my life for most of my life (i'm 19). She recently went to prison for violation of probation   because She is an irresponsible crack addict. I take her phone calls but I have only gone to visit her once. Am I a bad person for this?
No! To clear your concience, you should write her a letter telling her why you are not coming to see her and how you feel about everything. I think you should try to love her because she apparently doesn't love or truly value herself.She as well as you need to know that your past does not determine your future unless you allow it too. MY advice to you is to love your mom and be something you are proud of and maybe an inspiration to her. Bad person NO You ARE NOT. If you were you wouldn't feel guilt over this. It  sounds like you are a hurt person, don't get bitter . Just get better. Do something good with yourself."

2,"what is teleportation? why an unknown indian is being made a guiney pig?
The stunning scientific invention, what one can describe as the invention of the century or perhaps millenium, has also in the process is violating human rights. One unknown indian has been made as guinney pig for 'TELEPORTATION EXPERIMENT'. Three instrument has been kept inside the head of that Indian in 1996 without his knowledge, and is still continuing for almost 10 years. His life now is an open book and that person has lost his privacy. These days even criminals are not treated like this. What is the media the world over doing? What is the human rights activist the world over been doing on this blatant violation of human rights? When does this experiment going to end? How long this Indian going to be tortured. Can anyone throw more light on this to help this Indian whose mind seems to have been taken over by the American and other European scientists. This stunning invention could help the society only if this Indian survives the attack. But the million dollar question is WILL HE
Yes you are correct about the unknown Indian bit!! I haven't heard about either him or the experiment, and I haven't found any one else that has, but I think my 'teleportation' gear is playing up a bit, I'll get it re-tuned and try again later!! I thought teleportation was a means of transferring physical matter almost instantly? Not brain waves!!\nAre you sure your brain waves haven't been transfered??"
1,"Do you have to read the whole Bible to get into heaven?
Please don't answer if you are not a Christian
If you read the whole Bible, you'll probably stop believing in Heaven.  That is if you read it with an open mind.\n\n\n\nNotice all the people saying you don't have to read the Bible to get into Heaven.  If that was the case why would people have spent so much time writing the instruction manual?  How can you believe in something you know nothing about?

3,"6 yr old son with a Deviated Septum!!!!?
My son is 6 yrs old and he has a deviated septum. He has had this problem for yrs now and has also seen numerous doctors about it. They all keep doing the same thing. My son is to the point where he has to sleep sitting up cause he has really bad nosebleeds and im scared that he will drown in his own blood. Does anyone know what else i can try or knows or anyone that could help us with this problem? The doctors say that they can't do surgery on it cause it isn't that serious yet. I have to send my boy to school with 2 sets of clothes cause he has nosebleeds so bad at school. He is also having a hard time breathing at times. So will someone please help me I am up to listening to what everyone has to say. Thak You for taking the time to read this and respond.
A deviated septum is a VERY common condition..and probably not the reason for the nosebleeds.  Try going to a different doctor with just a complaint about the nosebleeds and let them look further into that problem first and foremost.  Environmental factors such as very low humidity can lead to frequent nosebleeds as well as high blood pressure and trauma to the nasal tissues.  Rule out everything else before subjecting him to surgery when it might not even help."

3,"smoking and bad health...?
why do people smoke when they know its bad for them? it's not called a cancer stick for nothing. why are people so ignorant about it.  i was wondering also what you think may be a cause for all the cancers and diseases out there... i mean, look at all the stuff we inhale through our lifetime, and all the stuff that goes into our bodies, couldnt that contribute to why so many people get cancer and diseases.  Just curious on opinions cuz its ridiulous how much this stuff spreads...
Read this \nSmoking is one of the worst things kids or adults can do to their bodies. Yet every single day nearly 4,400 kids between the ages 12 and 17 start smoking. Why? There's more than just one simple answer. Some kids may start smoking just because they're curious. Others may like the idea of doing something dangerous - something grown-ups don't want them to do. Still others might have grown up around lots of people who smoke and they might think it's the way to act like an adult.\n\nYou've probably heard that smoking and tobacco use can cause cancer and heart disease. That's true, but sometimes kids can't really think that far into the future to worry about an illness they might not get for 20 years. So let's talk about the problems that might affect kids more quickly:\n\nbad breath \nyellow teeth \nsmelly clothes \nmore colds and coughs \ndifficulty keeping up with friends when playing sports \nempty wallet - cigarettes and tobacco products are very expensive! \n\nWhy Is It So Bad for You?\nCigarettes and smokeless tobacco kill hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. You know those rubber bracelets that were created to bring attention to different causes? The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids created a red one with the number 1,200 on it. Why 1,200? That's the number of people who die each day due to smoking.\n\nThe nicotine and other poisonous chemicals in tobacco cause lots of diseases, like heart problems and some kinds of cancer. If you smoke, you hurt your lungs and heart each time you light up. It also can make it more difficult for blood to move around in the body, so smokers may feel tired and cranky. The longer you smoke, the worse the damage becomes.\n\n\n\nThe Other Cost of Smoking\nUsing tobacco eats up a lot of money, too. A pack of cigarettes costs $4, on average. That means, even if you buy just one pack a week, you'll spend $208 in a year. Some people smoke a pack a day, which adds up to $1,460! That's a lot of CDs, computer games, and clothes.\n\nWhat's It Like?\nUsually, people don't like smoking or chewing tobacco at first. Your body is smart, and it knows when it's being poisoned. When people try smoking for the first time, they often cough a lot and feel pain or burning in their throat and lungs. This is your lungs' way of trying to protect you and tell you to keep them smoke free. Also, many people say that they feel sick to their stomachs or even throw up. If someone accidentally swallows chewing tobacco, they may be sick for hours. Yuck.\n\nI don´t know why people smoke when they know it is dangerus, bad, murderous   for them?  bye..."

7,"are fourth quarter (10-Q) SEC filings along with annual filings?

That Depends.  A company can file its 10-Q and its 10-K at the same time, but they don't have to as long as both are received by their required due dates.  Also if a company does not use a calendar fiscal year, say October, then the 10-K would be due well before the 4th quarter 10-Q."

3,"what is the average size of a mans penis.?

This is in my own writing, it wasn't copy and pasted, enjoy it, it took me a while to write it and hope is beneficial to everyone. Thanks.\n\nSince I have answer to many of these question regarding penis sizes, i recollected most of my answers, read it and you make be satisfy with a correct answer.\nIs a little less than average, but i could predict that at least 20% of males are of that size or under ;) , well actually height does not matter, some people over six feet tall dont have a 5 inch dick! I came up with this after researching it! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >4.5-5.0 moderate > 5.0- 6.3 (average 65% of any male u encounter are around this size!) > 6.7 (10-20% of popul) more than average > 7.2-9 less than 10% (gifted) > 9+ thats a big ******* story! ahhaah 0.1% of the male population *(Different web site and researches show these stat as the average penis 5.1, 5.7, 5.9, 5.877 from these numbers you can conclude what’s average, since all those are say to be average, I guess they are diff because are taken in different regions, let say if u take the same test in china you would find out that 4.7 is average! and 6 is to big. well other internet survey say to be 6.2 so is funny because it does not match with true measurement, so self measurements adds more than 2 cm. Be proud of what you have, the average vagina is about 3-4 inches so there is no problem filling up that space! and if the woman loves you, there is no problem.. but everyone wants a bigger penis even I and i have 7.3 :) .... **** dont they say smaller pennis stand up longer? enjoy \nyou don’t worry; I bet money that 80% + those that make fun of other with small organs have less than 6.6 inches! cuz only 10% of the population have over 7 inches!\ndo stretching it may give u a few cm\n<proud! \nwill know ur final size when u reach 17... you will gain from .2-1.5 inches from that age up to 17! \n\n\nBUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE IDEAL AND DREAM SIZE, Here goes **\n\nThe ideal penis would be above average size (if you were given a woman what would you pick the same girl with smaller or bigger breast? yes is possible you pick above average and not to big either, is the same thing for penis..) what would that size be? hmm I would definitely say 7-8 inches x 6 inches of circumference..thats a bit bigger than porn actor though, most porn actors have between 6-7 inches but since their are bellow 6 feet their penis look bigger on them... and so there are porn actor with more than 8 inches...(note that those male actors on the internet with mega penis are mostly the same people...there aren’t many with over 10 inches...) like I said is preference some woman may prefer something smaller then 5 inches... or something bigger than 7 ... but at the end you will love a woman with small tities you usually never dump her for that.... it happens to be the same with women and our penis... Hope this helps..\n\nforget the motion of the ocean.... sorry girls but a 4 inch guy can do what a 7 inch penis do ( if they know what they are doing of course)vaginas are 2-2.5 inches wide therefore a penis with girth of 6 inches will reach and stretch you so all ur nerves are receiving pressure, so is ur G spot everything is done by PRESSURE, NOT THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN learn that....a 5 inch penis can almost do the same thing but give the same person different sizes and u will see the different of course anything over 9 inches can hurt and less pleasure but anything from 7-8.5 inches is the BEST of sizes of course if it has 6-6.5 inches of girth\n\n\nI had like 6.5 when I was 16 and now I am 18 it is 7.3,.. Don’t feel bad, try doing exercises like stretching! maybe u gain something in 1 month! keep going if u see any gain maybe instead of gaining 1 inch.. u gain 2-3! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >5.2 moderate > 5.5- 6.3 (average 60 % of any male u encounter are around this size!) > 6.7 (10-20% of popu"

Hinduism is the term used to describe the vast diverse religious thought that is based upon the Vedas and has its history in ancient India. It's also the religion I practice.\n\nIt is the oldest religion in the world and the third largest religion in terms of the number of followers (about 3 billion).

Hinduism is also the official state religion of the nation of Nepal (the only nation where Hinduism is the official state religion).

2,"what is the boiling point for polyacrylonitrile?

The boiling temperature of acrylonitrile *monomer* is 77.3°C at 760 torr, 64.7°C at 500 torr, 45.5°C at 250 torr, 23.6°C at 100 torr, and 8.7°C at 50 torr.  Melting point is -83.55°C.\n\nHowever, the BP of the polymer -- polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -- would depend on the chain length of the polymer.  Here's a link to a generic MSDS:\nhttp://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/PO/polyacrylonitrile.html\n\nI would agree with the other answerer that, if you tried to boil PAN, it would melt first, then decompose and char, possibly releasing toxic fumes, before ever getting to the boiling point.

3,"Can someone tell me if I have lyme disease or not?
So over the weekend I encountered a tick.  It was lodged under my right arm and I needed help getting it out b/c it was stuck in there pretty good.  So on Monday and Today, my whole body is aching a lot.  When I walk up and down the stairs my knees hurt and the right side of my stomach hurts a lot, even more if I cough or sneeze.  Once a while I get a headache.  It looks like a tiny ring is starting to form where the bite mark is.  So I went to my DR and he looked at it and said ""no, you don't have lyme disease, if you did the ring would be about 2 or 3 inches big.""  But what I don't get it is, I have some of the symptoms, so how is it not lyme?  Can anyone tell me or give me some advice?
Forget your idiot of a doctor. Something is definitely wrong here. If it isn't Lyme disease you might have an infection. Maybe you did not get the head out. Get to the E.R. right now. Do not play with your health. I'm serious. Stop waiting to see what everyone on yahoo has to say and get to the hospital. I am really worried that something is wrong here and you need medical attention.\n\nI found some info online:\n\nTicks\nThe very worst out there, in my opinion, is the tick. The very thought of having one of these parasites feeding on you is enough to make your skin crawl. It's not so much that they are known vectors of Lyme disease and that they feed by plunging their beaklike mouthpart deep inside you and then secrete a cement-like saliva which literally glues them in place. It's the fact that they prefer dark and moist places on your body to attach themselves to; places like armpits, bellybutton holes, and, you guessed it, your crotch. These are all places I'd rather not have something nibbling at.\nPerforming regular tick checks are crucial in heavily tick infested areas. It's best to use the buddy system for this. Of course, this can get embarrassing at times. I'll never forget when my wife and I, while traveling through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, began our nightly routine of stripping down and checking each other's private parts for embedded ticks, when a group of Boy Scouts paddled by. I tried to explain to them what we were doing, which, according to my wife, made the scenario even worse.\nIf you do find a tick lodged into your skin, make sure not to panic and start yanking away at it. You're just liable to pull the thing in half, leaving its head inside you and increase the chances of infection. The best way is to first spray it with a good amount of bug repellent. This will definitely force it to relax its grip, since the tick actually breaths out of its butt while its head is lodged into your skin. Don't burn it with a cigarette or match like some older guide books recommend. This will just make the tick hold on tighter and become more difficult to get out. After allowing some time for the repellent to take effect, place a pair of tweezers (tick pliers can also be purchased at most outdoor stores), and, without squeezing the tick, reach inside, beneath the body, and gently pull it out. Then disinfect the area with antiseptic or soap and water. \n\nSymptoms of Lyme disease: \n\nA circular red rash forming around the bitten area \nFlu-like symptoms \nPainful joints \nInsomnia \nLocal paralysis \nSkin sensations \nHearing loss\n\nMore info from another site:\n\nLD symptoms can imitate other diseases and can be misdiagnosed.\n\nEARLY LOCALIZED DISEASE\n\nSigns and symptoms of Early Local Lyme Disease often starts with flu-like feelings of headache, stiff neck, fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. About 60% of light-skinned patients notice a unique enlarging rash, referred to as erythema migrans (EM), days to weeks after the bite. On dark-skinned people, this rash resembles a bruise.\n\nThe rash may appear within a day of the bite or as late as a month later. This rash may start as a small, reddish bump about one-half inch in diameter. It may be slightly raised or flat. It soon expands outward, often leaving a clearing (normal flesh color) in the center. It can enlarge to the size of a thumb-print or cover a persons back.\n\nTo be considered local disease the rash must be at the tick bite site with no other major organ system involvement. A rash occurring at other than the bite site in an indication of Disseminated Lyme Disease.\n\nDon't confuse a local reaction to a tick bite, with signs of infection. A small inflamed skin bump or discoloration that develops within hours of a bite and over the next day or two is not likely to be due to infection - but rather a local reaction to the disruption of the skin.\n\nDISSEMINATED LYME DISEASE\n\nSome people do not notice these early "

Oxygen usually has 2 valence electrons (unless reacting with fluorine, in which case it can be 6). Fe has variable states of oxidation, most frequently 2+ and 3+.

3,"Would gluten intolerance or celiac disease show up on a fasting lab?

all tests must be done while the person is on a gluten containing diet. Antibodies are reduced and intestinal damage begins to heal immediately upon removing all gluten from the diet, so the risk of misdiagnosis is increased if the person is not eating gluten. For those who have already commenced themselves on a gluten-free diet, professional guidelines recommend a re-challenge of 2-6 weeks with 10 g of gluten (four slices of bread) before repeating the investigations. Those who experience severe symptoms earlier can be regarded as sufficiently challenged and can be tested earlier.["

They never tell you that the fillings you get will need replacing in the future, do they?  \n\nI don't know if the teeth are MORE likely to get more decay than unfilled teeth, but I do know that they can develop more cavities.  If your new cavity is near the old filling one new filling maybe used for both, but if the cavity is not near the other one, the tooth will have two fillings.\n\nI've had both kinds."
3,"Do I have ADD?
Whenever I show symptoms of havig ADD(hyperness,talking on and on, wanting to be on the go.) my mom says that I need to calm down bfore she takes me to a therapist, and that she doesn't want to see me have to take Ritalin. So I was wondering if I have ADD because I frequently am hyper, can't stop my thoughts, I can talk on and on and on, and I seem to always be on the go. Should I see a therapist?
Oh gosh, NO!  Just being a hyper person does not mean you have ADD.  Do you have trouble concentrating?  Bad grades in school?  Personally, I think parents resort to medications too soon.  Let kids be kids."

Only a certified accountant could answer this for you---and surely you have one (?) and if not---you better get one-----The number of stores that you have---even the level of actual business you are doing has but certain input into whether or not your business is solid in its entirity---alot of factors go into this summary----Major companies with unbelievable cash flow go under on a regular basis for any number of reasons---too rapid in expanding being one of the culprits---assumation of debt loads beyond the business' capabilities is another---Major Repeat Problem with alot of business that fails is the fact that the people running the business are very familiar with their product or service and are emersed in that and have no skills or focus on the actual bottom line of the overall business---So there is no way anyone here can answer your question with any certainty---YOU NEED AN ACCOUNTANT---NOW"
7,"any good tips on stocks in the $2.00 - $3.00 market????

Don't focus in the price per share. You could buy an over-priced $1.00 stock. Focus on good companies with sound financials and a good business model that you believe is going to keep the company growing. Even if the price per share is $100. You can buy as little as one share. Another couple of things: always diversify, and think looong term. Good luck!"

A Prophet’s Counsel and Prayer for Youth\nBy President Gordon B. Hinckley\n\nText of a talk given to youth and young single adults on 12 November 2000 at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City and broadcast by satellite throughout the Church.\n\nGordon B. Hinckley, “A Prophet’s Counsel and Prayer for Youth,” Ensign, Jan. 2001, 2\nI think there never before was a meeting anything like this in this Church. There are so many of you here tonight. How good you look.\n\nSome of you have come with doubts. Some have come with high expectations. I want you to know that I have been on my knees asking the Lord to bless me with the power and the capacity and the language to reach into your hearts.\n\nBeyond this hall are hundreds of thousands of others who are participating with us. To each of you I say welcome. I am glad for this tremendous opportunity to speak to you, and I recognize how important it is.\n\nI am now old in years—90 plus. I have lived a long time, and I have lived with great love for the young men and young women of this Church. What a truly wonderful group you are. You speak various languages. You are all part of a great family. But you are also individuals, each with his or her problems, each wishing for answers to the things that perplex you and worry you. How we love you and pray constantly for the genius to help you. Your lives are filled with difficult decisions and with dreams and hopes and longings to find that which will bring you peace and happiness.\n\nOnce upon a time, a very long time ago, I was your age. I didn’t worry about drugs or pornography because they were not available then. I worried about school and where it would lead. It was the season of the terrible economic depression. I worried about how to earn a living. I served a mission after I finished the university. I went to England. We traveled by train to Chicago, made a bus transfer across that city, and went on to New York, where we caught a steamship for the British Isles. While riding the transfer bus in Chicago, a woman said to the driver, “What is that building ahead?” He said, “Ma’am, that is the Chicago Board of Trade Building. Every week some man who has lost his fortune jumps out of one of those windows. He has nothing else to live for.”\n\nSuch were the times. They were mean and ugly. No one who did not live through that period will ever understand it fully. I hope with all my heart we never have anything like it again.\n\nNow, here you are on the threshold of your mature lives. You too worry about school. You worry about marriage. You worry about many things. I make you a promise that God will not forsake you if you will walk in His paths with the guidance of His commandments.\n\nThis is the age of great opportunity. You are so fortunate to be alive. Never in the history of mankind has life been filled with so many opportunities and challenges. When I was born, the average life expectancy of a man or woman in the United States and other Western countries was 50 years. Now it is more than 75 years. Can you imagine that? On average you may expect to live at least 25 years longer than someone who lived in 1910.\n\nThis is the season of an explosion of knowledge. For instance, when I was your age there were no antibiotics. All of these wonderful medicines have been discovered and refined in more recent times. Some of the great scourges of the earth are gone. Smallpox once took whole populations. That is gone entirely. It is a miracle. Polio was once the dreaded fear of every mother. I remember going to visit a man with polio in the county hospital. He was in a great iron lung that moved his own lungs as it pumped up and down. There was no hope for him; he couldn’t breathe on his own. He died, leaving his wife and children. This terrible disease is now gone. That too is a miracle. And so it is with other matters.\n\nOf course you face challenges. Every generation that has ever walked the earth has faced challenges. W"

Help. Dose anyone have any good dieting tips?? I exercise and try to watch what I eat but I can't loose. what's the fastes way to loose?
I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.\n1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.\n2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).\n3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.\n\nIt will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  \n\nA sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.  Check it out.\nhttp://www.caloriesperhour.com/\n\nCheck out my before and after pic at my yahoo 360 page\nhttp://profiles.yahoo.com/gorillamyke\n\nStay motivated, and get up and walk every day.

3,"Do I have PID?
I happened to come across the disease on the internet, and I had ALL the symptoms.

Is this PID or something else? I'm very scared.
It's highly unlikely that you have PID,so,please stop worrying yourself.Abnormal discharge,particularly if discoloured COULD indicate a mild infection..you dont have to have sex to get that.\nAs for the right-sided pain,it COULD be your appendics,so,again consult you GP.\nPain during a period is normal for a lot of women,sometimes to the point where it prevents you from taking part in every day activities.When it gets as bad as that just take a couple of pain-killers or anti-imflamatories and rest up with a hot-water bottle until you're feeling better.\nAbove all..dont be scared!"

well i have been eating junk  food none stop and  eating like twice the amouont im used to eatting.I moved out of my dads house and we never could  just go in the kitchen and find something to eat so i think that might  be it but  im not shure
Lots of things affect the amount we eat, and what we crave.\nMoving out of your home can cause stress, and we often eat foods that are high in empty calories to try to feel better.  Starches, fats, and sugars all help increase the endorphin levels in the brain (those are the chemicals that can create a temporary feeling of satisfaction and well-being).\nHormonal changes are common in teens, so it could be your hormones are just a little more pronounced right now - add the stress of moving out and you have a powerful physical combination.\nWinter weather can also make us feel like eating - kind of like squirrels gathering food to store up for the long winter ahead.\nPlus, believe it or not, junk food contains a lot of chemicals and ingredients that can become addictive.  The body craves the fats, carbs, and salt you find in junk food and makes us want to eat more each time.  Salt especially is really like a drug, especially in young women.\nAnd if you couldn't just snack anytime you wanted, and now all of a sudden you can, its like releasing the pressure on a spray can -you can go overboard with the new freedom.\n\nBut being on your own means you have to take complete control of your life and your eating.  \n\nA teen, especially one that is underweight, needs the vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients (that means the stuff found in food that isn't a vitamin or mineral) to grow strong and put on the proper weight.\nJunk food can cause acne, bad hair, brittle nails, and irregular periods. Not to mention the wrong kind of fat in the wrong places that is just impossible to get rid of later (trust me, I know all about it).\nSo my advice - find something healthier to eat when you get those cravings for junk.  Popcorn (without the butter) is a better choice (though not the best as there are no nutrients in it).  \nOr a big juicy apple - has a lot of good things in it, and believe it or not will satisfy your cravings to snack.  Add a few pieces of cheese and you have a great balanced snack you can eat whenever you feel like it - even late at night.\n\nYour body may be able to burn some of the excess calories now, but that won't last and you'll find yourself putting on unhealthy fat and running out of energy.  This is a time in your life to party and enjoy life - but keep this up and you'll fall asleep on the couch while your friends are having a good time.\nTake control, hon.\nGood luck."

3,"my husband ejaculated in me around april 28 how long will i know if i'm pregnant?

it would all depend on your cycle. obviously if your period is usually around the 10th, then if you are late, it might be time to take a test. it is difficult for a woman to become pregnant immediately after her period or immediately before. most women ovulate in the middle of the cycle. this means that if april 28 was 2 weeks after your last period and two weeks before your next period, then you have a pretty good chance a baby will be on the way. if you had just had your period end on, say april 25, then it is highly unlikely."
1,"For all you Catholics out there, how many of you know  today is Divine Mercy Sunday, a mandatory  feast day?
Also, do any Christians, Catholic or not, know the background and message from Jesus to St. Faustina about His Divine Mercy, and the amazing promise He made? For any and all true believers reading this out there, this promise is one of life and death - eternal life and death. Decades ago, Jesus promised to St. Faustina that any Catholic who went to Confession and Mass the week after Easter, performed a work of mercy after that, and offered up a prayer for the Pope would have all of his or her previous sins forgiven and abolished instantly, like at baptism, so that person would be starting a new spiritual life. This promise only applies to Catholics unfortunately, but fortunately, it applies to all Catholics, even the most unfaithful. So any of you Catholics that may happen to read this today, if there is still any time before the last Mass at your parish today, and you haven't gone to Mass yet today, go to Mass. If you didn't go to Confession yesterday, at least get more info aboutthis
I believe you are referring to the plenary indulgence that was available for saying the Chaplet of Divine Mercy in a church on Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nA plenary indulgence is a complete release from the *temporal effects* of sin (such as Purgatory).  Our sins are forgiven only when we go to Confession.  But even when they are forgiven, there still remains temporal effects that we must live up to.  For example, if I spill something on the floor, my mom will surely forgive me, but she will also make me clean up the mess.  Having to clean up the mess is the temporal effect of our spilling something on the floor.  Whenever we sin, even if we are forgiven, we still have to ""clean up the mess"" we made.  \n\nThe conditions for receiving a plenary indulgence are: to do the indulgenced act (such as praying the Chaplet of Divine Mercy in a church on Divine Mercy Sunday), to receive the Eucharist, to participate in Confession, to pray for the Pope's intentions, and to be detached from all sin, even venial--i.e. to be willfully set against commiting even the least sin.\n\nIf not all of those conditions are fulfilled, the indulgence will be partial instead of plenary.  So part of the temporal effects of sin will be taken away.\n\nNote that there are many ways to earn indulgences.  Saying the Rosary in a church or in a family group is one way to earn a partial indulgence--you can earn those every day!  Indulgences can be applied to yourself or to the dead who are in Purgatory, but not to other living people."

I was told that in the bible it says: “If girl or woman is raped she is to be stoned to death. This is because she is unclean in the sight of God.” I would like to know exactly where it says this in the bible.
I am surprised by the amount of Christians that answered this question that apparently have not read their bible.  Yes it does say that in the bible, in the old testament in the laws that God gave to Moses.  Although it does give different scenarios like if the woman is raped inside the city she should be stoned to death because she should call out for help before it happens but if she is outside the city where there is no one to call for help, then she has committed no sin and should not be put to death.\n\nNo wonder people don't want to convert to Christianity when supposed Christians answer this way and apparently have not read what they claim to preach."

Whether you like him or not, you have to respect Dr Phil just because of one thing.\n\nHe continually asks his guests one simple question: ""How's it working for you?""\n\nSuccess in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.\n\nI am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.\n\nBefore I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. \n\nSo how does your body burn fat?\n\nIt is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:\n1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then\n2.You can burn the fat\n\nThat process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.\n\nHow does your body release the fat from the cells?\n\nBefore you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.\n\n1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.\n2.Include small amounts of good fats.\n3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods\n4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.\n5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.\n\nThe most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.\n\nReleasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.\n\nThe reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…\n\nYou need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. \nDoing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime \nsoon. Here is what you need to do:\n\n1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate\n2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...)\n\nThe world most efficient “fat burner” is FREE and You already have it.\n\nBefore I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. \nWeight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so e"

I had a regular period for the longest time, and I'm almost 18. They started getting irregular about a year ago. I would skip a month, have two in one month, or it would come early. If the pregnancy tests have come back negative for all of them, I wouldn't worry about being pregnant. If you continue to stress about it, that can also make your periods skip. If you go to the doctor for a test, maybe that will ease your worrying?"
2,"can any1 tell me about population graphs?
1.) J shaped or exponential graph\n2.) S shaped or sigmoid graph
The exponential graph does not take into account that eventually a population will reach a point where it has fully exploited its resources.  It rises slowly at first, but then increasingly steeply, because as the population grows, there are more organisms reproducing. However, the rate of reproduction per organism is constant.  If the graph is drawn on semi-log paper, it will be a straight line.\n\nThe S-shaped curve considers that as a population fills its habitat, resources become scarce, and the population can only then grow slowly.   The initial portion is very similar to the exponential curve.\n \nAs the population fills its habitat, the rate of growth declines, until eventually, the population is stable at some maximum, called the carrying capacity.  This is called the stationary phase.\n\nIf populations grow quickly, they can exceed the carrying capacity, degrade the environment and experience swift decline.   After the population crashes, the environment can rebound.  \n\nThis is illustrated in some population of predators versus prey.  Where populations cycle between growth and decline."

If the Trans-Am would be massless and the tires would stick perfectly to the underground it would really accelerate suddenly when the driven wheels hit the ramp and would fly up the ramp with 60 mph relative to the truck or 115 mph relative to the ground. But with an finite mass this sudden acceleration would need a HUGE amount of power. The engines power is limited as it takes a finite time to accelerate a car to a given speed. So the car can't accelerate suddenly from 60 mph to 115 mph.\n\nBut that's only half the truth: From a viewpoint of the tires the underground changes it's speed. There are no tires in the whole world that could keep the grip while such a sudden change of speed. They will simply spin and by that accelerate the car even less then the engine could do. This gives the stuntman a comfortable amount of time to step off the gas and reduce the engine power to roll the ramp up slowly."
1,"Is the plural of a mouse for the PC also mice or is it mouses?
The plural of mouse (the animal) is mice. Does this also go for a computer mouse?
According to Saugus.net (http://www.saugus.net/Computer/Terms/mouse/view) it's MOUSES, but you should read this article by By Andy Walker, Cyberwalker Media Syndicate   \n\n\nIs it mice or mouses? A discussion of the pural form of 'computer mouse'\n \nQuestion: We have a different kind of question for CyberWalker. What is the plural of computer mouse, ""mouses"" or ""mice""? \n\nAnswer: I've been on the trail for an answer for this question for a week and in the process I was snubbed by the very inventor of the computer mouse. \n\nI started my search for the truth about mouse plurality with Douglas Engelbart, who invented the device at the Stanford Research Centre in California in 1963. \n\nYou may recall that he was recently named the winner of the 1997 Lemelson-M.I.T. Prize for his inventions, which besides the computer mouse, include windowing and videoconferencing. \n\nWell, he didn't answer my e-mail and I'm a little indignant about it. I browsed his Web page at www.bootsrap.org anyway and discovered that in his 1970 patent application for the device, he called it an X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System. \n\nBy extrapolation, Engelbart's plural of mouse is XY-PIDSes. Not exactly catchy. Good thing he didn't go into product-naming as a career. Then again I shouldn't complain, if he had we might be eating the Agrandized Multi-Layered Hamburger Sandwich at McDonald's. \n\nThe next stop on the rodential syntax search was M.I.T. After all, they're a bunch of bright folks and they did give Doug a half-million dollars for his badly named, but nifty invention. \n\nOn their Web page was a media release about the prize. In it they refer to the plural of the device as ""mice,"" quotes included. That suggests to me that they don't quite take the word very seriously. \n\nAt a bit of a loss, I headed for Logitech's home page at www.logitech.com.They're the world's largest makers of the mouse. \n\nI sent them an e-mail too, asking for a definitive answer. None arrived. \n\nIn their marketing material they refer to the word ""mice."" But who can take marketers seriously? I mean on the same pages they refer to scanners and video cameras as ""imaging solutions."" That's like calling your feet ""transportation enablers"" or your mouth a ""communication output orifice."" \n\nCompletely frustrated and at my wit's end, I punched in a few search terms into the Altavista search engine and came up with what may be as close an answer I as can find. \n\nI found the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing and one of its co-authors Paul Mayer, a chemistry grad student and research associate at Princeton University. FOLDOC is a searchable dictionary of computer terms that spans jargon (try ""mouse arrest""), technical terms and anything to do with computing. \n\nIf you punch in ""mouses"", it reveals the definition for ""mouse."" If you try ""mice"" it also points to the mouse definition. \n\n""This an interesting and I'm sure very debatable question,"" Mayer told me in a lengthy and much appreciated e-mail reply. \n\n""I will share some insight, but correctness is not implied or guaranteed."" \n\nHis frankness and willingness to indulge me was refreshing. He even checked a real dictionary, something I'd neglected to do. \n\n""Webster's 7th Collegiate Dictionary would appear to give mice as the plural for mouse in all instances,"" he explained. \n\n""However, the plural of this device should be determined by common usage. If this is the case then it would appear that both mice and mouses are acceptable."" \n\nIn researching his answer for me, he did a search on Altavista for both terms. \n\n""Both turned up an abundance of hits,"" he said. \n\n""But one could even argue that 'mouses' is preferred because it avoids confusing a few p"

7,"Is is stupid to quit a job you otherwise love just because you can no longer tolerate your a**hole supervisor?
I work in a satelitte office with one other worker, who is above me in the chain of command but not my ""boss"" and not the owner. He power trips, doesn't treat me respectfully or like a human being, and is all around unpleasant. I've explored the possibility of changing offices, but my chances are slim and I'm thinking I might just have to quit.\nMy job has so-so salary, but excellent benefits and great people (just not in my office). My job is occasionally satisfying, just unsatisfying because I can never seem to please the guy I work with and I seem to always make these end-of-the-world mistakes that warrants him to give me a 15 minute disgused lecture on why I'm stupid.\nI've brought it up to him (politely). He told me to just ""bear with it"" and that it was my job to put up with it. I've brought it up to my boss using euphemisms (I find it's hard to criticise people above you) and the resolve was to assign me projects that don't involve my coworker.\nShould I quit?
Oh my gosh, did you work at the same place I did?  Your story sounded exactly like the situation I had.  Management and supervisory positions had changed at my work and from then on, the nightmare began.  The witch who rose to power was a narcissitic, egotistical backstabber who made it so unbearable for everyone. She continuously found it amusing to berate, belittle and degrade each and every employee in the company by telling us that we were underworked and so grossly over-paid (we all made more $$$$ than her). Someone who is in the psychology field said that this supervisor's had low self-esteem issues (she weighs close to 300 lbs.)and it is satisfying to her to put others down in order to feel better about herself.  She can't control her weight so she tried to control others.  Unfortunately, confronting this supervisor only compounded to the problem, as she could not take constructive criticism from ANY employee...and talking to the owner of the company proved to be useless, as he always avoided any type of problem or confrontation issue.  Since I did not have an advocate or anyone I could really turn to, the stress of going to work every day was taking it's toll on my health.  For peace of mind and sanity, I gave them my two weeks notice but did not burn my bridges upon my resignation. It is a good idea to have something lined up to go to, especially if you need the income and medical benefits.  You really don't want to be at the mercy of your current employer when it comes to recommendations or verifications.  Good luck....."

2,"Why is our moon just called a ""moon"" when the other moons have specific names attached to them?
....yet we generalize them as ""moons""? Yes, it is a stupid question, but if you could shed some light on the subject....it will be much appreciated.
The name of our planet is the Earth. The name of our moon is the Moon. The name of our solar system is the Solar System. \n\nNotice that I capitalize them, because when used as names, they are proper nouns. This also helps us distinguish between the planet Earth and earth (meaning soil), between the Earth's Moon and moon (meaning the natural satellite of a planet), and between our Solar System and any other solar systems (since any system containing a star and a planet or a planet-forming disk can be called a solar system.) \n\nThis is the usage approved by the International Astronomical Union, the body in charge of naming celestial objects. It may seem odd that these important objects don't have names, but if you think about it, it just reinforces their importance. For example, the Moon is the Moon, not just any moon. It requires no other name, because it's the most important moon! \n\nYou may read or hear people using Luna for the Moon, or Terra or Gaia for the Earth, or Sol for the Sun, but these are poetic terms, often seen in science fiction stories, but not used by astronomers in scientific writing."

Are there certain questions I really need to ask the builder. I am worried that I might get tricked or ripped off. Thank you!
Well you should ask first of all for a good faith estimate from each lender, to see which one of the is giving you a better deal. You also need to know if they're giving you a pre-payment penalty, If so for how long. (average pre-pay is about 2 years, unless you have really bad credit) If you have Excellent credit you shouldn't get a pre-payment penalty. thae situation varies depending on your Fico Score. Also Find out how many points they're charging you up Front and if they're getting anything back form the lender after close of escrow. All this matters because. Also if you're financing 2 new loans make sure that they're Fixed, so that your monthly payment doesn't change every month. Also HELOC's loan interest rates change every month, and the rate is going up, which means that your payment will also go up.  So be very careful about this."

I don't know if I should take it though, because it comes from one of those vitamin stores, and i've heard of people getting sick from taking vitamins from these stores where the sales clerk isn't very informed.
I think one of the biggest misconceptions about store-bought vitamins is that they are the same vitamins we get from food.  Most often, they're actually synthetic forms of what occurs naturally in food, and that synthetic, manufacured for is really scary!\n\n""Taking the synthetic form of vitamin C, for example, can actually thicken the arterial walls of the heart by as much as 2.5 times which can lead to heart disease and can do harm to the body! Ascorbic acid ( synthetic vitamin C ) is the word that you need to watch out for!\n\nTaking the synthetic form of vitamin A is proven to actually increase the rate of cancer which can do more harm than good to your body! But the whole vitamin A ( from vegetables ) actually does the exact opposite. Whole Vitamin A significantly reduces the rate of cancer! Most Vitamin nutrients on the market today use stripped down synthetic vitamins rather than whole vitamins straight from vegetables and fruits like our vitamin! Why? Synthetic vitamins are much cheaper to produce. \n\nTaking the synthetic form of Vitamin E is proven to actually suck vitamins and minerals right out of the bones which can do more harm than good to the body! Once again, most vitamin supplements today are using all the synthetic vitamins because they are cheap to manufacture.""\n\nIt seems to me that synthetic vitamins, those that we normally find in the sotres, aren't the best option.  I use a food-based multivitamin so I get all those nutrients in their original form.\n\nHow do you know what you're getting?\n\n""Remember, next to the name of any vitamin, if you don't see a name of a food or an asterisk leading you to a place on the label that tells you the food source of the vitamins, you are more than likely looking at an inexpensive, processed vitamin that is stripped of all other compounds that are normally present with vitamins that are found in fruits and vegetables. If you see the name of a food referenced to the vitamin, be excited to know that you are getting vitamins direct from the whole food and, therefore, you are also getting the essential precursors, enzymes, activators, antioxidants, and micronutrients (essential compounds) that are naturally found with vitamins. These essential compounds make it much easier for the body to absorb and utilize the vitamins you are taking!

It's likely that these aren't pubic lice, or ""crabs"". Crabs inhabit pubic hair, rarely venture away from it, and are much smaller than an engorged Tick. If the animals are stuck to your skin, they're likely ticks. Warning: because of the sensitivity of the skin on you penis, take care in removing them. Rubbing alcohol can make them release, DO NOT use petroleum jelly. The best method, while maybe the least comfortable, is to grasp the tick with tweezers at the head, and pull with a constant force until the head detaches. Once out, you should preserve the ticks in rubbing alcohol (which will also kill them) in case your doctor needs to test them for any diseases. If you get both heads, and have minimal damage to your penis, you don't need to go directly to your physician. If you see signs of infection (swelling, redness, warmth at the area, pain) go see him/her immediately. Also, keep your eye out for the common ""bulls eye"" sign for Lyme disease."

""Key Derogatory"" means they want to rate you as ""chargeoff"" but they can't because they're missing some bit of information in the file. For example, you stop paying your bills, move and leave no forwarding address. The creditor may have a good idea where you live now (perhaps the post office sent them your new address) but they've not actually heard it from you. So you become a key derogatory instead of a chargeoff because they can't confirm your new mailing address."
3,"how can i overcome polycystic ovaries syndrome?

Although there's no cure for PCOS, there are several ways that the condition can be treated and managed. If you are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend losing weight.Weight loss can be very effective in lessening many of the health conditions associated with PCOS, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Sometimes weight loss alone can restore hormone levels to normal, causing many of the symptoms to disappear or become less severe. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can look at your food intake and your exercise and activity to tailor a weight-loss program for you. Exercise is a great way to help combat the weight gain that often accompanies PCOS as well as a way to reduce bloating.  Sometimes doctors prescribe medications to treat PCOS. A doctor might first have you try birth control pills to help reduce the androgen levels in your body and regulate your menstrual cycle. Birth control pills may help control acne and excessive hair growth in some, but they don't work for everyone. Other medications used to treat PCOS include antiandrogens, which counter the effects of excess androgens in the body. Antiandrogens can help clear up skin and hair growth problems. Another medication, metformin, which is used to treat diabetes, can lower insulin levels. In some, it can help control ovulation and androgen levels. This can make your menstrual cycles more regular. Some treated with metformin have also experienced weight loss and lowering of high blood pressure."

3,"I am suffering from mild to moderate impotency, should I marry with Viagra's help or not?
I want to get married to my sweetheart, but I suffer from a degree of mild to moderate ED(impotency), although I can perform a bit. Any suggestion please? Remember that in our culture, people don't have sex before marrige?
You should be honest about this with your girlfriend/wife-to-be. Hiding the truth will only build up performance anxiety and add to your impotency. It will make things worse if you hide the truth. I believe she will accept you despite the circumstances and she will respect you for being honest, I hope. \n\nUse viagra if you have to but lets look at other alternatives first. Here's a little tip: in the recent 1.5 to 2 years, I have been sseriously stepping up on my exercises. I am 36yrs old and I can complete 2.4KM in 9min and 30sec. I have observed that I have become more potent in my sexual intercourse as I became fitter. Why not get into shape in the name of love and reap the benefit of better sex at the same time?

I have to work outside a lot and do not like wearing shirts on hot days , I like a tan anyway and despite the risks love to be in the sun. Is there a product anyone knows of that does a great job of prolonging a pretective tan and keeps the skin well mositurized for a long time to help keep it as healthy as I can. I drink a lot of water. The sun has so many benefits to mood as well as vitamin D so it should not get a bad rap entirely. I use some protective sun tan lotions at times if I know I have to be out a prolonged time doing a job. What products do you guys recommend? Only serious answers please!!!!!All jokers go to another site,LOL.
Dion,\n\nIt sounds like you are fortunate enough to have skin that tans well enough to eventually handle full sun all day.\n\nThis is really a good thing.\n\nI've used coconut oil as a moisturizer in this way, and it is close to perfect.\n\nI don't know if it has any sunblocking capability, since I'm not trying to block the sun.  I have felt the great effects of improved mood from the sun, and I have read a lot about the large amount of vitamin D that the skin produces from the sun.\n\nBut is is one heck of a moisturizer.\n\nBe sure to get the organic kind, like a health food store has."

The idea was started by royalty. The real rich would have their Bible pages outlined and decorated in red ruling(all the words not just Jesus').This was to make it easier to read due to the extremly small print of Bibles back then. It wasn't until the 1900's that book publishers decided to incorporate this idea into a useful tool and put the words of Christ in red, also helping make the Bible easier to understand. I don't know which company started it first but it wasn't King James, he was dead long before this. Today the antique red ruled Bibles bring a much higher price than non red ruled, still catering to the royalty."
2,"What is cryptobiosis?

Cryptobiosis is an ametabolic state of life entered by some lower organisms in response to adverse environmental conditions such as desiccation, freezing, and oxygen deficiency. In the cryptobiotic state, all metabolic procedures stop, preventing reproduction, development, and repair. An organism in a cryptobiotic state can essentially live indefinitely until environmental conditions return to being hospitable. When this occurs, the organism will return to its metabolic state of life as it was prior to the cryptobiosis.\n\n[edit]\nForms of cryptobiosis\nThere are several forms of cryptobiosis. These are outlined below.\n\n[edit]\nAnhydrobiosis\nAnhydrobiosis is the most studied form of cryptobiosis and occurs in situations of extreme desiccation. The term anhydrobiosis derives from the Greek for ""life without water"" and is most commonly used for the desiccation tolerance observed in certain invertebrate animals such as bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, brine shrimps and nematodes. However, other life forms, including resurrection plants, the majority of plant seeds, and many micro-organisms such as bakers' yeast, also exhibit desiccation tolerance. Invertebrates undergoing anhydrobiosis often contract into a smaller shape and some proceed to form a sugar called trehalose. Desiccation tolerance in plants is associated with the production of another sugar, sucrose. These sugars are thought to protect the organism from desiccation damage, and studies have shown that anhydrobiotic organisms can survive for decades in the dry state. In some creatures, such as bdelloid rotifers, no trehalose has been found, which has led scientists to propose other mechanisms of anhydrobiosis.\n\nA new application, 2004, of anhydrobiosis is being applied to vaccines. The process allows some organisms to survive dried-up by replacing water with a sugar solution that keeps cells in a state of suspended animation until rehydration occurs. In vaccines, the process can produce a dry vaccine that reactivates once it is injected into the body. In theory, dry-vaccine technology could be used on any vaccine, including live vaccines such as the one for measles. It could also potentially be adapted to allow a vaccine's slow release, eliminating the need for boosters. This proposes to eliminate the need for refrigerating vaccines, thus making dry vaccines more widely available throughout the developing world where refrigeration, electricity, and proper storage are less accessible. (source BBC News: [1] )\n\n[edit]\nAnoxybiosis\nAnoxybiosis isn't considered a form of cryptobiosis by some. It takes place in situations lacking oxygen, and involves the organism intaking water and becoming turgid and immobile. Studies have been done about survival rates of organisms during anoxybiosis, but have achieved conflicting results.\n\n[edit]\nChemobiosis\nThe cryptobiotic response to high levels of environmental toxins.\n\n[edit]\nCryobiosis\nCryobiosis is a form of cryptobiosis that takes place in reaction to decreased temperature. To initiate cryobiosis, the organism freezes all of the water within its cells. This allows the organism to endure the freezing temperatures until more hospitable conditions return. Studies have shown that the longer an organism remains in cryobiosis, the longer it takes for the organism to come out of cryobiosis. This is because the organism must use its own energy to come out of cryobiosis, and the longer it stays in cryobiosis the less energy it has.\n\n[edit]\nOsmobiosis\nOsmobiosis is the least studied of the four types of cryptobiosis. Osmobiosis occurs in response to increased solute concentration in the solution the organism lives in. Not much is known for sure, other than that osmobiosis appears to involve a cessation of metabolism.\n\n[edit]\nExamples\nThe most commonly known organism which undergoes cryptobiosis is the tardigrade, or water bear. It is the most studied as well, partially because it can undergo all f"
3,"skin biology?
Discuss ways in which product use(cosmetic and toiletry) can protect\n\nor harm the skin and its appendages.(if possible please give\n\nreferences)
There are so very many ways that applying substances to the skin can\n\ncause harm. The skin is an organ. It's function is to allow water\n\ncarrying some chemicals out of the body. It features in the body's\n\nability to regulate temperature. The hair on your skin helps with this\n\ntask. When you get cold the hair is raised to protect your skin.\n\nAlthough most of us don't have enough hair any more and all this does\n\nis create ""goose bumps"". It needs to breathe - to have free access to\n\nair - in order to function.\n\n\n\nIt also acts as protection. The same hair raising effect that we get\n\nwhen we are cold is a protection. Have you ever seen a cat fluff up\n\nit's fur and hiss? That's the same thing your hair fillicles aretrying\n\nto do when a scare gives you goose bumps. If you had a lot of hair, it\n\nwould stand up and make you more frightening to whatever is scaring\n\nyou.\n\n\n\nThe skin also reacts to foreign substances that can cause damage by\n\nsending signals to the brain - these may include itching, stinging,\n\nburning, pain and other warning signs of danger to our body.\n\n\n\nIt also lubricates our skin with oil through pores that attach to\n\nglands in the lower levels of the epidermis (skin).\n\n\n\nPutting on a cover of makeup blocks the pores that allow oil and water\n\nto escape to the surface of our skin. These blocked pores can become\n\nclogged and infected. Simple infections are called pimples and are\n\ncleared up by using an astringent that causes the pores to expel the\n\nblocked oil. But using astringent can dry your skin and cause it to\n\nproduce even more oooil to moisturize the dry areas. Keep using makeup\n\nand astringent cleaners and you interfere with the natural balance of\n\nyour skin.\n\n\n\nCreams and lotions can harm your skin, too. Some reactions are due to\n\nskin sensitivity to certain products. Lanolin is a big offender and is\n\nused in a lot of softening products, but other ingredients amy be just\n\nas offensive to your skin. Allergies exist to all sorts of ""natural""\n\nand man made things.\n\n\n\nPerfumes can cause all sorts of reactions. If they contain a lot of\n\nalochol (most do), they act as astringents and can have the same\n\neffect as astringents that you use for cleaning blocked pores.\n\nAllergies are another problem with scents. Oil based perfumes can\n\nsignal your skin to stop oil production and you wind up with skin that\n\ngets too dry."

2,"What is the Pope's most current statement about the Catholic church's stance on evolution? ~ 4 Science in KS

In 1950, Pope Pius XII wrote an encyclical addressing the Catholic teachings about the origins of human life, and what parts of ""evolutionary theory"" can be compatible with Catholic Faith.  You can find the english version here:\n\nhttp://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html\n\nBasically, Catholics must believe that Adam and Eve were real people and that God created the human soul directly.  As far as how He created our bodies, it is acceptable to believe in some form of evolution, as long as you believe God created the universe from nothing.\n\nSo the concept of Darwinism (we came about from random mutations that were not guided or designed by a creator) is unacceptable.  We (as Catholics) can still believe in evolution as long as we believe that it is a process that was designed by God."

7,"Is being a pilot or flight attendant hard?

Both jobs are difficult in that you are required to be away from home 3 or 4 nights a day and usually work 10 hour days in different cities. Flight attendants are often on their feet for hours, the air in the plane is dry, and the perks of working for an airline are deteriorating.\n\nTraining to be a commercial airline pilot takes years and $$$$$. You would need a college degree, and then become a pilot instructor for a few years, and then work as a private pilate (unless you go into a military flight training program). Once you work as a private pilate, you need 1000+ hours of flying commercial and aircraft type ratings to be considered. Besides that you need presence, leadership, and customer service/people skills.\n\nMost airlines have their own flight attendant training that takes up to a month. You have to have a solid work record and pass a background ck. Initially, for the first few years, you get the worst shifts and work on Holidays and weekends.\n\nWhy do people do it? Once you get past all the training, it is fun. You see the world, and can make good money after a few years. Plus, you can get a few days off a week in a row."

No economy is a true economy.  Capitalism, as is the dominant form of economy in the US allows market forces (supply, demand, cost of production, etc) to determine the price of goods and services.  There are factors such as govt. regulations, ceilings, and floors that also affect the price of these goods.  The role of government in true capitalism is to stay out of the way.  This also has consequences, such as monopoly and other forms of dubious activity.

7,"the mystery of bermuda triangle, is it real?
need a friend to invite me to visit sweden on business purposes
The Bermuda Triangle, also known as Devil's Triangle, is an area of ocean roughly defined by Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and the southern tip of Florida. It is claimed that within this zone many ships and planes have disappeared under highly unusual circumstances. The United States Coast Guard and others disagree with the assessment of paranormal activity, arguing that the number of incidents involving lost ships and planes is no larger than that of any other heavily traveled region of the world.\n\nThe first mention of any disappearances in the area was made in 1950 by E.V.W. Jones as a sidebar on the Associated Press wire service regarding recent ship losses in the area. Jones' article notes the ""mysterious disappearances"" of ships, planes and small boats in the region, and ascribes it the name ""The Devil's Sea."" The area achieved its fame mainly because of the 1974 book, “The Bermuda Triangle” by Charles Berlitz. The book consists of a series of “mysterious” disappearances of ships and aircraft, including the December 1945 loss of five U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bombers, known as Flight 19.\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle has been attached to many bizarre theories to explain the nature of the disappearances. The list includes transportation by extraterrestrial technology, a ""temporal hole"" of some form, the lost city of Atlantis, and other supernatural causes.\n\nSolid research done by Lawrence Kusche, and published in 1975 as “The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved.” show this area of water to not be such an unusual place. It showed that the proportion of boats and planes to go missing to be no greater than any other area of water. Of course the debate still goes on about the area and the statistics are spun in whatever direction a new report or book wants them to lean.\n\nIf there is mysterious goings on in the area the most likely explanation is the abundance of methane hydrates in the area. A methane hydrate is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystalline structure and is solid up to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Ruptures of the hydrate can release vast amounts of methane gas. This gas could cause the density of the ocean to reduce enough to sink a ship in the effected area. The gas could also affect aircraft by lowering lift, giving false altimeter readings, and even stall and aircraft’s engine. These effects of methane gas have all been experimentally proven."

I helped a 15 yr old walking home in the cold by welcoming her into my car and taking her home. I feed the homeless, I donate money to CHKD, and do my best to give Thanks. What do you do? You don't have to be a millionaire to donate money. I'm nowhere near that.
Wow, I was just going to feed my family.  I have and do try really hard to do nice things, give a compliment, pay a tab if someone doesn't have the $, and always be a good friend and listener.  The highway thing, wow, that gets yu at least the halo, if not the wings. \nRandom acts of kindness, put money is someones meter, stick up for the ones who can't for themselves, love your children, teach them well and they will pass it on.\nI am thankful for people like you who give without the expectation of something in return.  Keep up the good work...the wings are on the way."
2,"a yellowish,grey orbrown form of quartz beginning with the letter C?

that'll be chalcedony. it differs from quatrz in it's shape, as it usually occurs in botryoidal masses, whereas quartz occurs more in hexagonal prisms. chalcedony is similar to opal, but can be distinguished by its higher specific gravity. it can be formed as a dehydration product of opal, hence the connection. the colour is highly variable, as it can be white, blue, red, green, brown or black, and varieties of chalcedony include jasper, agate, chrysoprase, onyx and carnelian. it's formed in rock cavities, especially lavas, and it develops at relatively low temperatures, whereas quartz occurs in any rock type, and usually formed at higher temperatures"
3,"medical advice?
a really close friend of mine told me that she's having episodes where she starts to bleed or spot a little bit during sex and then for the next 2-3 days after. she says this hasnt happened before and she also said that it doesnt happen everytime she's with him. i'm not sure if she's been tested or not but i told her to do that just to be safe and she said she already did and nothing was positive. could she be lying and really have something or is it possible that something else could be causing this? i'm worried about her but it's hard to talk to her about it because i'm clueless on the whole subject. i've never had that happen to me before and she thinks i'm avoiding answering her. i'm not avoiding, i just dont know. any ideas???
Your friend really needs to go to a doctor and have an examination down below. I don't know what age your friend is, but post-coital bleeding (bleeding after sex) should always be investigated as it can be a sign of cervical cancer, which is a cancer which tends to affect younger women from about the age of 25 upwards.\n\nThe other possibility, and the one which is probably more likely, especially if she is on the pill and has been for a while, is that she has something called cervical ectropion. This is a non-cancerous condition where the sensitive inner lining of the cervix ""rolls"" out and can be damaged slightly during sex, which leads to bleeding.\n\nHowever, she really does need to have an internal examination to rule out the more serious causes of post-coital bleeding."
7,"I need help with an invention idea.?
I have a few ideas, but I don't know where to go from here. All of the web sites I looked into seemed to be scams. Does anyone know of a legit company that could help me patent and market my invention(s).
I don't know what to tell you other than what happened to me. I paid $500 for a patent search. The company told me that this was a great idea and nothing else like it was on the market. They could get me a patent and help me present it to people who could make it. I would make X-amount of dollars and would be rich (lol). The patent cost me another $5,000.\nThey did get me a patent. A Design Patent. This patent just covers what the product looks like, not how it works. If you design a telephone with the buttons in a certain place, this is a Design Patent. What makes it work (the guts to it) is a Utility Patent. Someone can come along and change the way that it looks, you're out of luck. \nCheck with BBB and past clients. \nI felt ripped off and that was 14 years ago, I still see their ads on television everyday. Every ones idea is a winner, just watch ""American Inventor"". Be careful!!"
7,"How to be impressive on an initial interview?
I'm needing tips on what should i doto make an impressive resume, i used to give false statement on the info about me in my application letter( not at all) and it really works. Is it advisable?
make it interesting enough so that they invite you in for the interview and then show up naked with flowers for the ladies and cigars for the men. \nSeriously.. Stretching the truth is accepted as the normal standard nowadays.. but outright lying on something that can easily be looked into will always get you fired before you are even hired..\nChances are they are looking at several prospective leads for the same job.. if you are to have any chance of getting it. and all are equally qualified.. it will come down to the smaller things.. like...  looking professional, paying close attention to the wording of your resume.. punctuation/grammar .. that sort of thing. Look smart on the inside and you will build confidence in them to think highly of you.\nAnd, duh ... show up on time :)\nGood Luck :)"

7,"what is marketing planning?

A Marketing Plan is a written document that details the actions necessary to achieve a specified marketing objective(s). It can be for a product or service, a brand, or a product line. It can cover one year (referred to as an annual marketing plan), or cover up to 5 years.\n\nA marketing plan may be part of an overall business plan. Solid marketing strategy is the foundation of a well-written marketing plan. While a marketing plan contains a list of actions, a marketing plan without a sound strategic foundation is of little use."

1,"how do you say good-bye to a co-worker who is dying soon?
I have worked with my friend over 26 years and she is dying of cancer that cannot be treated. She is a wife and mother of two young girls ages 11 and 9.
I recently have experienced this. I have in the past as well. I suggest deep respect in any connection without exhibiting deep sadness or regret. Also saying ""I'm sorry"" isn't a good approach.\n\n   The best, most effective approach however, may be, chat about the positive aspects of that person, and their accomplishments. Be lite hearted without being overwhelmingly humorous, but let it flow, from them as well.\n\n   For me, I know even now, that tomorrow isn't promised. Share with them the value of every upcoming moment, get involved more closely in sharing yourself with them as a friend, not someone who has already buried them.\n\n   Celebrate with them all the good that has been and still can be, even when terminal.\n\n   They already know that the end is imminent. They don't need to be reminded of it from others, especially friends.\n\n   My only regret truly is in what I'll end up not finishing.

If you sleep alone and have no pets nor do you have an insect infestation, you are scratching yourself in your sleep.  It's not really to uncommon, especially if you have dry skin.  Try putting a heavy cream (not lotion) on your arms before going to bed at night to hydrate your skin.

is this human nature to belittle someone who is good to you? why can't people be good, honest and helpful?
I don't know why, but it seems that there are many people who simply enjoy hurting others.  I suspect it stems from them feeling powerless and insecure, so they get a small charge to their own egos when they can make someone else feel bad. \n\n There are, also, others who simply take advantage of people - they see goodness and kindness as a kind of weakness they can exploit for their own means.\n\nDon't let this turn YOU bitter, though.  Remember to tell yourself that those people, in the end, will suffer for it when they find they lack solid, real and loving friendships in their lives."

We all know that creationism is superstitious nonsense... but people believe in superstitious nonsense all the time - like astrology, luck, destiny, souls etc. - and the world doesn't grind to a halt because of it.  Personally, it grieves me to see people embrace irrationality like this, but unless someone actually wants to work in biology, how much harm does a belief in creationism do in practical terms?
I agree with mainwoolly (and not for the first time); I suspect that nonsensical beliefs of all kinds actually have a real-world, real-time effect, on the human mind if nothing else.\n\nWe all know people who never make a decision without first performing a tarot card reading, or faithfully check their horoscopes every day, or whatever.  They simply do not hear you when you point out that it's a pile, no, a truckload, nay, a Matterhorn of horse-hockey.  These same people retain enough sense to enable them to pass their drivers' license tests; to get and hold jobs; to raise children who stay out of prison (the majority of them, at any rate).  \n\nAnd they never notice the contradiction, they never notice that their own brains are divided against them.

2,"How do muscles get shorter?

They contract. Muscles are made up of overlapping fibers of myosin and actin. The myosin fibers have ""heads"" that attach on to the actin filaments and pull on them, which slides the fibers along each other.\n\nIt's more complicated than that, but I don't know how much you want to know. The myosin heads require ATP in order to latch onto the actin filaments. Additionally, the bonding sites on the actin are usually hidden, and require calcium ions in order to expose those sites."

Most peoples' normal sleep cycle lasts 90 minutes.  When you first fall asleep you are in a light sleep, then you go deeper into sleep and back to a light sleep after about 90 minutes.  The longer that you are asleep the shorter your cycles are.  If you slept for 3 hours, you probably had two full sleep cycles and awoke naturally when you were in the lightest stage of sleep.  When waking from this stage of sleep you feel most awake and refreshed.  If you are awoke from a deep sleep you will more likely still feel tired."

It may just be that your estrogen levels are low.  This can happen at any age due to low body-weight/low body-fat.  Estrogen is produced by fat cells,  the fewer fat cells, the lower your estrogen levels.  \n\nLack of menses, presence of hot and cold spells, nightsweats, hair loss, dry skin, brittle nails can all be signs of low e2 levels. \n\nThis can easily be remedied by using an estrogen patch or taking estrogen orally (not the same as birth control pills).

Religion is not God it is socially constructed to guide and control the masses if you read plato and aristotle or socrates you can see how our current pop religions were fashioned after some of these beliefs when the greeks were searching for a just society and they were trying to figure out how to avoid chaos and if you read their answers they all stated they needed some God or Gods to help keep a just society \nI there are both positve and negative feelings and choices that we choose to live with and it is up to the individual to make his own life a living hell by holding hatred ignorance shame and guilt in him and making those dominant forces in there lives or the individual can strive to make positivity the dominant force in his life and enjoy love and possibly find profound inner peace for a little while and love living and life these are all personal choices we are all responsible for making ourselves and off of the spiritual level on downto eatrh one we can live like we do spiritually feeling sorry for ourselves and pointing our fingers blaming everyone else for what is wrong including god who wont make it better like we wairt for they whoever they are and the government to magically correct its own faults and start serving our interests rather than its own or we can choose to become aware active participants in our own lives and communities and empower ourselves and others and live with a sense of satisfaction and purpose as we strive to become more enlightened and pursue our goals and dreams and positivity. whoever or what evr the individual chooses to follow or believe it is right for that individual one persons reality does not negate anothers instead of clinging to our closed minded dogma and looking at things life as some flat mirror this side is right and that one is wrong maybe we should consider spirituality and life more like a diamond a multifaceted element of many coexistng perspectives and all other perspectives appear distorted from where we sit I highly doubt ghandi goes to hell and the pope who prtects pedophiles in his church doesnt I think it is much more complex than that and we need to realize thatwe are aal part of this same creation whoever God is whether he be a force of energy positive and negative or other or a personified being something created this universe and that was enough we need to take responsibility for our own fate and stop crying and waitng like whiny babies for something else to come along and make it all better and fair all those other labels christian muslim etc are irrelevant"
3,"how do you know when a person is bipolar?

OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them."

This is not especially a big deal. It happens. What you expect is pretty much what you will get. So if you expect anxiety and concern, that is what is going to happen. Better to take action. If you feel anxious in any way, simply slow down, stop what you are doing. As soon as you can, lay down for a while. Have some music playing on the radio. Then think calm, and count your breathes, in and out, to 100.\n\nOn the other hand, it is good to work some exercise into your daily routine, as simple as taking a walk. Make it short at first, and then a little more. Keep this enjoyable. There is nothing like doing something physical like this to give you confidence that you really are in control."

Advertisers normally provide/pay for the finish material, install the poster and pay contractual rates for advertising displays.

I would be willing to work vitually anywhere, except the obvious place like Iraq or Afghanistan, etc. But I would like to go to South America (not USA or Canada again been there on holidays), Europe (bar Britain, preferably Eastern, Moldova and Belarus and the likes, I have seen a lot of Western Europe on holidays), North Africa (ie Morocco, Chad, Sudan, Mali, etc), Asia (including Middle East) and Oceania. \nThanks!
jobs teaching english are easy to get.  you are usually herded in with other english speakers and paid very poorly.  it is a good chance to get out and about.  friends of mine have backpacked around most parts of the world picking up day jobs here and there to keep them going.  its easier picking up jobs in countries that are less structured than western europe and the united states and canada.  they even turned decent profits in south america because depending on where you are its very very inexpensive to live -- a notable exception is venezuela -- part of why chavez got elected -- the old government was as bad the united states."
1,"Is everyone born an atheist?
YES!\n\nWhen you are born there is no idea in your mind about a god or some sort of creator. It is only put their by your parents or society.\n\nTherefore, friends, we are all brothers and sisters in atheism. I just believe that the theists just had a bad experience with atheism and are rejecting it. They need to open their mind and look at the beauty of the world and realize that no religion provides all the answers.\n\nI ask you this? What if you are wrong believing in a god? Then you have wasted your whole life on this beautiful earth believing in and devoting your whole life to something that doesn't exist. If I am wrong about being an atheist, at least I got to enjoy paradise while here on earth!\n\nThere, how do you respond when the tables are turned and the shoe is on the other foot?
Of course everyone is born an atheist. Adults believe in a great variety of religions, but you'll never see a 3 year old who believes in something different than their parents. They just believe whatever mumbo-jumbo is shoved down their young throats at home....."
1,"Why disagree that God is one ?
A short story:\na young christian of 13 , asked his mother >>> what were people worshiping at the time of Adam, Noah, Abraham,......until Moses?\nshe answered >>> God !!!.\nhe asked >>> why we worship jesus then?\nshe answered >>>because it is written in the bible.\nhe asked >>> what will be the faith of the people before the coming of jesus ? \nshe answered >>> I don't know.\nSo, After thinking about this even more, knowing that there is\na religion ( Islam) that worships only one God , like the people\nbefore. Again ,he too believed this. And became a muslim at\nage 17 himself. Why? Because he could not accept or find reasons to believe in the trinity concept. None of the people before nor after any of the phophets believed in this. This belief\n is only in the bible( new testament) not in the old testament or\nthe Quran.Can we trust or believe blindly in the bible and ignore\nwhat most people on the earth have all believed.\n\nhttp://www.al-sunnah.com/muhammad_in_the_bible.htm\nhttp://www.muslimworld.co.uk/truereligion.htm\nhttp://www.thetruecall.com/home/\nhttp://www.islam-guide.com/life-after-death-by-wamy.htm
Jesus (pbuh) teachings were exactly the same as Muhammad(pbuh) , they called for the same God which is ONE and Almighty. Jesus and Muhammad both were Holy prophets But Alas !!! Sait Paul has changed the whole concept of christanity and its totaly different now .And they did more damage to their religion by changing Bible hundred of times. there are number of confusions in their religion but wish they admit and seek for the truth. May Allah guide all of us Ameen !!!"
3,"how is anit-venom made?
just wondering how it is made from the venom itself?
Antivenom (or antivenin, or antivenene) is a biological product used in the treatment of venomous bites. It is created by injecting a small amount of the targeted venom into an animal such as horses, sheep, goats, or rabbits; the subject animal will suffer an immune response to the venom, producing antibodies against the venom's active molecule which can then be harvested from the animal's blood and used to treat envenomation in others."

I am writing a report on domestic violence and am focusing on abused males. What I am looking for are personal testimonies (confidential, of course- a first name is appreciated). Statistics and reasons why you would/would not come forward are also welcome.
It's a lot more common than you think. The liberally biased media only shows the one side that affects women, but of couse as usual they never show the balance of both sides. Have the two dolt morons who ansered prior ever heard of autopsy reports from HBO? They chronicle how men were beaten, abused and poisoned prior to dying? Women abusing or trying to kill their sopuse is becoming a common orruccence more and more and it is an alarming problem that needs to be addressed."
1,"What are the characteristics of asians?
please describe each characteristic from each region of asia.
Umm... If you are looking at the region of Java in Indonesia, You would find them very friendly. Take away the political propaganda in the world and you will find people who are really kind and family orientated. They are traditional folk who like others and are very kind. THe javanese have a lifestyle of not killing their enemies because without them they wouldn't be in check like the Yin and Yang. Yin can not exist without the existence of Yang. This is similar in Bali and I am really pissed off that people still think indonesians are cold blooded killers. The majority of the people who are muslim are moderate muslims who don't want to hurt people. It's the chaotic extremist conservatives that are making things bad.\n\nPhilippine people are social, adaptable, flexible, and hard working. what makes a filipino unique is their ability to love others for who others are plus the social, adaptable, and flexible stuff. This is what makes them so successful in the field.\n\nI know this is only two areas that i know of. I hope i have adequately given you a good response."

3,"What are the risk factors of smoking while you are pregnant?

Low birth weight, increased risk of birth defects, increased risk of miscarraige. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, it constricts your blood vessels, decreasing blood flow within your body. Smoking while your pregnant will decrease the blood flow to the baby. Also nicotine crosses the placenta and can enter the baby's bloodstrem, causing vasoconstriction in the baby's developing system. It's best to quit if you're pregnant, or if you're planning to get pregnant."

3,"Is there a law in PA that FORCES generic drugs on you?
My husband just went to our local drugstore to pick up his Rx for Flonase, which he's done for over a year. He got home and realized they'd given him a generic instead. When he called to complain and have it switched, he was told by the pharmacy that a new law in PA _REQUIRES_ them to give out generics if they're available, no matter what the patient wants. \n\nI've never heard of such a thing - I've checked online and the only thing I've seen relates to Medicare/Medicaid recipients - and we have Blue Cross/Blue Shield! - and they don't require generics on our plan.\n\nAnyone run into this? Is this really a new law or does my pharmacist just not know what he's doing?
The doctor has to write ""dispense as written"" or ""DAW"" on the script, or else the generic equivalent will be dispensed."

I tried one from GNC a while ago. All it did was make my heart beat super fast. It was terrible. I'd suggest if you need to lose weight to try Weight Watchers. I'm on it right now and I've lost 50 pounds. It's the only way I've been able to lose weight. Good luck! :)"
7,"What is Performance Management Framework? What items should it include?

A performance management framework is a process to manage employee performance. \n\nItems that should be included in an effective performance management framework would be clear job performance expectations. These expectations should defined by:\n\n(a) specific tasks to be completed;\n\n(b) measureable tasks (i.e. it has to be measureable to be managed);\n\n(c) achieveable tasks (i.e. employee has the ability and resources to complete the assigned task);\n\n(d) releastic tasks (i.e. it has to be doable); and\n\n(e) time lines (i.e. you need to make it clear when the task is to be complete). \n\nThe next item to be included in a peformance management framework is feedback. Timely and specific feedback (positive or negative) is to be provided to the employee on whether or not tasks are completed properly and in line with the defined parameters.\n\nIf work is not being completed to expectation then coaching, training or modification of expectations may required.\n\nIf work is being completed to expectation, then the performance management has been successful."

People have been brainwashed to think Muslims are bad. Only if those people could see past the cloak of media, then they'd know what's up, but unfortunately, they can't. It's not a certain religion, race, or group that's bad; it's an individual(s) who did bad thing(s). It's just a cruel world out there, dude, a cruel world.

3,"Anybody hip to Stevia here?
I've ALWAYS been skeptical whenever any governmental body tried to tell me to do or not to do anything. Turns out I was right all the time! I've been a diabetic, since 1974, and thanks to the FDA aspartame, Nutri-Sweet, has been legally poisoning me and everybody else. Aspartame, Equal, Nutra-Sweet and other names, has been shown to cause Cancer in an Italian study and is TOTALLY banned from Japan. Now these stuffed shirt's have had other, harmless, sweeteners banned from the US market, until 1994 I believe Stevia a herb that has been in use, almost, everywhere but here. Free market? Well, if you're wondering why those Artificial Sweeteners cost so much; the lobbyists cost big bucks. And guess who pays? Kind of makes me wonder WTF the Petroleum Industry, a much more powerful group especially with Bubba as President, is having banned currently? In about 50 years, by use of the Freedom of Information Act, we may discover somebody thought up a way to get energy from water but the Grease Monkeys kept it off the market. It would NOT be the first time such a thing has happened. For more info about Aspartame go here; \n\nhttp://www.holisticmed.com/aspartame/\n\nhttp://www.total-knowledge.com/~willyblues/
Yeah, alternative health care providers have had this information for years. You have to look out for YOURSELF in this day and age.  Stevia isn't bad, but a bit too sweet for me. I am not diabetic, so I prefer Xylitol.  I don't know if a diabetic could use it though.\n\nTruth is, the general public wants to have a diet soda so badly that they would only get mad at a governmental agency that would ban it."
3,"What organisms are present in a healthy bowel?
I'm trying to get my cats to have firmer stools.  Nothing is working that is in the norm, like strongid, albon, antibiotics, or immodium, changing to better food or to dry or wet food.  In the past i noticed a modest improvement if i disinfected the water bowl daily (like it gave them too much bacteria from their fellow kitty's mouths).  I've started giving brewer's yeast which seems to help the kittens that i foster, but not my grown cats.  So what besides bacteria and yeast live in a healthy bowel?
typically human bowels contain anaerobes, gram negative bacili and gram positive cocci. Animals' bowels, you should be talking to a vet or asking this question in the pets section, good luck"
2,"Is there a difference between hard contact and soft contact perscription scales?
I have an astigmatism and have had hard contacts for years. they irritate my eyes horribly, and want to know if switching to soft lenses is possible
Hard and soft contact lenses are prescribed and fit differently.  (You can't just take your hard lens prescription and order soft lenses from it.)  Astigmatism in general is correctable with either type of lens.  Only your eye care provider can tell you if soft lenses will work for you, so make an appointment to see your optometrist or ophthalmologist.  You should also be sure to have a yearly complete eye exam to make sure that there aren't any problems with your contact lenses and to check the overall health of your eyes."
2,"Are there aliens?

Although poorly worded, I expect that you mean aliens (non-earth species) from elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe answer is simply, possibly on the earth and most likely somewhere in the universe.\n\nIf there is non-earth intellegent beings present on the planet earth at this time, they are not saying and frankly I would'nt blame them considering the mess humans are making of this planet.\n\nAs for somewhere in the universe other than here. Just look at the studies of the universe that show an enormous number of planets, suns and a lot of galaxies out there. To consider that man is the only intellegent life in the universe does no justice to the intelligence of man.\n\nWith the incredible number of planets and suns in the universe there should be life out there, only at this time we do not have a great deal of capability in the location of such life, but science keeps advancing and someday it will happen that we will, or just maybe, they might visit us."

1,"How much care, effort and time do you put into decorating your Christmas tree?
Do you have a special approach?  Are you extremely precise (re: anal) about how the ornaments are hung?  Or do you just throw caution to the wind and let the ornaments hang where they may?
God is going to get you for this question. \n\nOk I admit it....I'm anal! lol Alright...I admitted it to the world!!\n\nMy dad is very much the artist. He taught me how to have an eye for art. He taught me how to have an eye for photography. He taught me about symmetry and he taught me how to decorate a Christmas tree. *sticks tongue out*\n\nSo decorating a tree is a very precise art in my house. I literally place (not put.....but place--how anal is that??? lol) an ornament on a limb and then step back to see how it looks. If it's wrong...... well it's removed. I actually have my ornaments divided into ""tiers."" (You're dying laughing right now aren't you? I sense it.... I sooooo sense it.) I have those ornaments that go on the bottom of the tree......those that go in the middle... and those that are small and delicate and go on the small thin limbs at the top. I also have the heavy large ornaments that must go ""inside the tree"" where the larger limbs are that can hold them. Ok needless to say...... my children hate me. They used to want to decorate the tree when they were young and I was that horrid person that I so hate that would say..... ""Oh no, honey..... you should put that here!"" and then remove her ornament and  place it elsewhere. I soon realized that I was totally and completely alienating my family. (Ok...... at last I recognize my horrid faults...lol) so now we get TWO trees. One that the girls decorate however they want..... and one for mom to make into her work of art. Life at my house during Christmas time has been much better since we came up with this plan. lol"

ask her if she is involved in the church in any way, like choir or bible studies. most of the time if you ask a girl a very small question about themselves they will like to talk about themselves for a long time, and when she stops just ask her how she feels about something that she has revealed to you."

I read somewhere that it's not.
Yes, but because they only interact only by weak interaction with other objects you need laaaaaaaarge detectors, simply because the chances that a neutrino simply goes through your detector whitout causing any effect is so high. Most of them even go through the whole earth whithout having any interaction. From wikipedia: ""For typical neutrinos produced in the sun (with energies of a few MeV), it would take approximately one light year (~10^16m) of lead to block half of them.""\n\nThat's why these detector experiments (Super-Kamiokande in Japan for example consists of 50,000 tons of pure water surrounded by about 11,200 photomultiplier tubes.) have to be so large."

there are people who kill themselves because of depression, which is a physical illness in that brain chemistry is so distrupted that the thoughts become disordered.  a depressed person will believe others are better off without them and think others will feel that way.  for many of these people, life feels so empty, meaningless, and hopeless that being alive requires more courage than pulling a trigger in front of your face.  for some people, antidepressants may work just enough to make them capable of pulling off a suicide.  for other people, their antidepressant might make them suicidal.  \n\nher act is highly unusual for a woman - women don't tend to use guns. she seems very angry.  i wonder if she had a personality disorder - borderline - and this actioin a way to hurt everyone around her and keep everyone crazy forever.  \n\neither way, it's a terrible thing that's happened to you, too.  your anger is very normal; most survivors of suicides have lots of anger.  \n\nyou might literally want to scream in the shower or when driving alone.  you may find this happening already.  \n\nkeep expressing your feelings - on paper, with friends, in the shower or car.  \n\nif she was depressed, maybe she thought, in her muddled thinking, that calling you in advance would leave you feeling guilty you didn't stop her.  she may have thought, in the strange way of depressed people, that she was sparing you.  \n\ni'm so sorry this happened.  fight back by embracing life."

3,"I recently heard a psychologist on television speak about the calming effect of marriage in men. what is it?
What behavioral changes that happen in men when they become married?  I heard something of a ""calming"" effect from some psychologist on television.  Whats the opposite effect of men not marrying?
I've also heard of this affect. Males are naturally more aggressive due to their hormones. But when the stimuli related to love are activated, they naturally become more docile, so they're easier to approach and be close to. Humans are still animals regardless of our high opinions of ourselves. Emotions Hormones and pheromones affect us as though they do any other animal. I could see how naturally, with it being in the subconscious that one is married, they're less likely to be aggressive with other males, in order to impress other females. This no longer applies to them, I would suppose it's the same mentality that allows the female gender to let themselves go. Perphaps this is just a scientific study proving that this phenomenon also happens in males. It makes perfect sense."
7,"After going bankrupt.  What's the best way to get your credit back in track?

when you go under chapter 7 you can finance a home the day you are discharged in most cases. To establish your credit you do need to get secured credit cards. Have someone you know and that trust you add you to their credit cards that always helps. Pay all your bills and accounts on time. When you go under chapter 12 that takes longer, you really can't do much until you are discharged. Chapter 12 takes longer to discharge because you have to pay back all your debt. Those payments all have to be on time along with your payments that are not in the bankruptcy."
1,"how has orientalism turned into prejudice or racism in the last century against muslim and arab americans?
I need some information on this for a school project.
Orientalists were revered scholars. In a Muslim country,all sculptres of colonial generals, princes and queens were removed from main Boulevards,after 15th August 1947, but the statute of a revered Orientalist continues to adore The Mall in Lahore Pakistan. To begin with, the orientalists were openminded. Later, they framed an opinion first and then gathered so called facts to prove they were right. So, ever since prior prejudice formed the student class of Orientalism, this noble branch of knowledge began its downfall. In the past, there have been great names among Orientalists who had reasons to respect Islam, The Holy Qur'an, The Holy Prophet, The Muslim Spiritual traditions. They rendered noble services to humanity and to their own Faith (other than Islam).The True Faith calls for respect to the Holy Persons of all other Faiths. Past Orientalists were True-and-Faithful. They were respectful and respectable."
2,"what do u do when u have two varibles on one side of a algebra question?

It all depends on what result you're hoping to get.  For example, if you want to solve a system of equations in two variables, you would try to get the variables on the same side in both equations.  If you want to express the equation in slope intercept form, you would move the y variables to the left side and the x variables and constants to the right side of the equation.  If you're trying to express the equation in standard form, i.e. ax + by + c = 0, you want both variables on the same side."
2,"Project: scaling of standard astrophysical objects and distances?
Goal: each group will scale one of the following sets of sizes and distances to the 2ndfloor\nwalkway in front of the library. The walkway is approximately 375 feet in length.Scale the sizes or separations to the walkway.\n1. Earth: separations of major cities choose\nabout 810\nfamiliar cities (recommend: San\nAntonio to , New York, Washington, London, Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Cape\nTown, Sydney)\n\ni have the distances in miles, km and ft: example to washington dc its 1389.55 miles, 2236.26 km, or 7336824 ft.  Just need to know how to scale a large distance to the 375 ft of the walkway, i know if i keep it metric its easier but i just need the ""formula"" to which to plug in my data.
Step 1) Make a list of all the distances you need to scale expressed in feet.\n\nStep 2) Examine the list and find the largest distance you need to scale. Let's call this distance L.\n\nStep 3) Divide 375 by L. This is the scaling factor. Let's call it S. It will be some quantity that is much less than 1. For example if the distance to Washington were the largest number on the list then the scaling factor would be 375/7336824=0.0000511120343080. To facilitate calculations, you should save this scaling factor into the memory of your calculator.\n\nStep 4) Multiply each distance on your list by S. This will produce a new list of numbers where the greatest distance has been scaled to 375 feet and all the other numbers are proportionately less than 375.\n\nHope this helps."

Keeping them could cause problems with your other teeth as they are pushing against them and this could cause crowding or even decay on the tooth it is pushing against as you aren't able to clean this area very well."

I have one and it is really irratating. Do they go away or do I have to go to the doctor? If I go to the doctor what will they do? THanks
Can Hemorrhoids be Treated?\nYes. Medical treatment of hemorrhoids initially is aimed at relieving symptoms. Symptoms can be reduced by: sitting in a a warm tub, Ice packs (to help reduce swelling), usage of a hemorrhoidal cream. Increasing fiber and fluids in the diet will also help (makes softer stool).\n\nIn some cases, hemorrhoids must be treated surgically. The doctor will shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue.\n\nWhat are Hemorrhoids?\nHemorrhoids are swollen but normally present blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum that stretch under pressure. Hemorrhoids are very similar to varicose veins in the legs. The increased pressure and swelling may result from straining to move the bowel. Factors contributing to hemorrhoids are: pregnancy, heredity, aging, and chronic constipation or diarrhea. \n\nHemorrhoids may occur inside the anus (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). An internal hemorrhoid may protrude through the anus outside the body. This is called a protruding hemorrhoid.\n\nSymptoms of Hemorrhoids?\nThere are many symptoms and everyone with hemorrhoids will not experience all of the symptoms. Some of the symptoms are: bright red blood covering the stool, painful swelling around the anus, a hard lump around the anus, fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or irritation and itching (pruritus ani). Excessive straining, rubbing or cleaning the anus may worsen symptoms.\n\nWhat Causes Hemorrhoids?\nHemorrhoids are caused by too much pressure in the rectum, forcing blood to stretch and bulge the walls of the veins. Sometimes the pressure ruptures the veins.\n\nAre Hemorrhoids Dangerous?\nNo. Hemorrhoids usually are not dangerous or life threatening. In most cases, the symptoms of hemorrhoids will only last a few days. Not every one with hemorrhoids will experience symptoms.\n\nAre Hemorrhoids Common?\nYes. Hemorrhoids affect both men and women. About half of the population will have hemorrhoids by age 50. Hemorrhoids are also common among pregnant women. Hemorrhoids are common among pregnant women because the pressure of the fetus in the abdomen, as well as hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, cause the hemorrhoidal vessels to enlarge. These vessels are also placed under severe pressure during childbirth. For most women, hemorrhoids caused by pregnancy are a temporary problem and given the right care will go away.\n\nHow Are Hemorrhoids Diagnosed? \nHemorrhoids are diagnosed by a doctor. The doctor will examine the anus, and rectum and look for swollen blood vessels. A digital rectal exam will also be performed. The doctor may also examine the patient with an anoscope, or a proctoscope. An anoscope is a lighted tube useful for viewing internal hemorrhoids. A proctoscope, is used to examine the entire rectum.\n\nCan Hemorrhoids Prevented? \nYes. The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep stools soft so they pass easily, with little straining.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n™"
2,"Which animal has become extinct in India as a result of indiscriminate hunting?

Most of the previous answers include animals that are not actually extinct yet:  there are still tigers and lions and elephants and bears in India, although many of them are critically endangered.\n\nThere are only a few hundred Asian lions left in the wild, and they were killed off primarily through indiscriminate hunting.\n\nThere are several species that have gone extinct in India in historical times.\n\nThe Dang's Giant Squirrel in 1940, the Long-horned Indian Buffalo (1850), and the Burmese Sumatran rhinocerous (1990 - actually a subspecies that went extinct) are some of them.\n\nThere are also species which have been extirpated from India (they are no longer found in India, but still exist elsewhere in the world), such as the cheetah.\n\nThere were also members of what has been dubbed the Pleistocene Megafauna, that lived in India and went extinct along with many other species at the end of the last ice age, such as the Stegodons, which were once found out as far as the Indonesian islands."

7,"what happens if i quit the co that has keough plan? do i get to keep what is earned?

That's a GREAT question and an important one. If you quit a firm that has a 401K (I presume you mean that by the Keough) you can TAKE IT WITH YOU in a single traditional IRA account. YOU GET TO KEEP WHAT YOU EARNED in a traditional IRA. This is advisable, as you can put the investments into funds or stocks that you choose. Your 401K has choices made by your HR dept, not always for how good an investment it might be, but based on choosing a 401K plan that can be administered cheaply by the benefits department. While you can leave it at the 401K plan, you are far better off to transfer it to your own IRA account.\n\nSo, to better your results, transfer your 401K when you leave by contacting the HR dept and asking for a distribution form. DO NOT take the check yourself, have the 401K transfered directly into your IRA account you've set up at a brokerage. Your broker will direct you into better investments, or you can research this yourself and do it yourself with fund companies or online brokerages if you feel you are willing to spend the time on the research."

2,"What is 'Temperature' ? why not use the term 'Heat' only to describe thermal incidents?
When we say ""It's Hot !"", do we mean its got more ""Heat"" or ""Temperature"" ?
Temperature, property of systems that determines whether they are in thermal equilibrium (see Thermodynamics). The concept of temperature stems from the idea of measuring relative hotness and coldness and from the observation that the addition of heat to a body leads to an increase in temperature as long as no melting or boiling occurs. In the case of two bodies at different temperatures, heat will flow from the hotter to the colder until their temperatures are identical and thermal equilibrium is reached (see Heat Transfer). Thus, the terms temperature and heat, although interrelated, refer to different concepts, temperature being a property of a body and heat being an energy flow to or from a body by virtue of a temperature difference.\n\nTemperature changes have to be measured in terms of other property changes of a substance. Thus, the conventional mercury thermometer measures the expansion of a mercury column in a glass capillary, the change in length of the column being related to the temperature change. If heat is added to an ideal gas contained in a constant-volume vessel, the pressure increases, and the temperature change can be determined from the pressure change by Gay-Lussac's law, provided the temperature is expressed on the absolute scale\n\nHeat, in physics, energy transferred from one part of a substance to another, or from one body to another, by virtue of a difference in temperature. Heat is energy in transit; it flows from a substance at a higher temperature that is placed in contact with a substance at a lower temperature, raising the temperature of the latter and lowering that of the former, provided the volume of the bodies remains constant. Heat does not flow from a lower to a higher temperature unless work is done."

my wife says she gets yeast infections when I drink beer,I only drink a six pack a week.
nVarious conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease (STD), can cause vaginal symptoms similar to those of a yeast infection. If you need help determining which condition you have, \n\nWhat is a vaginal yeast infection?\nA vaginal yeast infection is an excess growth of yeast cells in the vagina. Yeast infections are very common in women of childbearing age but can occur at any age. Although they can be uncomfortable, vaginal yeast infections rarely lead to serious health problems.\n\nWhat causes a vaginal yeast infection?\nA healthy vagina normally contains many bacteria and small numbers of yeast cells. The most common bacteria found in the vagina, Lactobacillus acidophilus, help prevent other organisms, such as yeast, from growing in excess and causing an infection. About 70% to 90% of yeast infections are caused by a strain of yeast called Candida albicans. 1, 2 \n\nWhen there is a change in the normal balance of organisms in the vagina, yeast can overgrow, causing symptoms. This imbalance can be caused by many factors, including use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for other conditions, high estrogen levels (as during pregnancy or hormone replacement therapy), or certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or HIV infection. \n\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe most common symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection are: \n\nVaginal itching. \nIrritated genital skin. \nPain or burning in the genital area with urination or sexual intercourse. \nIn some cases, white vaginal discharge that is usually curdlike and odorless. Some women have no noticeable discharge. \nSymptoms of a vaginal yeast infection are more likely to occur during the week before a menstrual period.\n\nHow is a vaginal yeast infection diagnosed?\nVaginal itching and a white vaginal discharge that is odorless and looks like cottage cheese are classic signs of a vaginal yeast infection. However, it's easy to misdiagnose a vaginal infection. If your symptoms are not typical of a yeast infection, you aren't certain of your diagnosis, or you're pregnant and have symptoms, see your health professional. A vaginal exam and possibly a culture of vaginal discharge can help diagnose whether another type of organism is present.\n\nHow is it treated?\nA vaginal yeast infection is usually treated with a vaginal antifungal cream, tablet, or suppository for several days. While some women prefer taking a tablet by mouth, oral treatment may be reserved for recurrent infection that may be caused by yeast throughout the body. This is mainly because oral medication affects the entire body, and vaginal treatment limits its effect to the genital area. Oral antifungal medication can cause side effects such as headache, nausea, and abdominal pain; vaginal treatment is unlikely to cause side effects. \n\nNonprescription vaginal medications are available for treating vaginal yeast infection; vaginal boric acid capsules are another option. If you have had a vaginal yeast infection before, are not pregnant, and are certain your present symptoms are the same as during the previous infection, you can self-treat your infection. If you have a yeast infection that keeps returning despite treatment, see your health professional. A recurring yeast infection can be a sign of another health problem. \n\nYeast infections are common during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, do not use any medication without first discussing your symptoms with your health professional. \n\nCan vaginal yeast infections recur?\nYes. A yeast infection is considered to be recurrent if you have four or more infections that cause symptoms and are unrelated to antibiotic use within 1 year. Severe or persistent yeast infections are a problem for about 5% of affected women and can be related to diabetes, pregnancy, or another health condition. 2 \n\nIf you have a recurrent vaginal yeast infection, your health professional may do a culture to confirm that yeast is present.

how much can you lose weight if you only ate one celery a day and you fasted for 10 days,  i got 56 day left til a big event, soooo, just to say , what if i water fast for 10 day and ate one medium size celery a day ( five cals, actually burns more when digested) and dont give me that health crap, cuz i dont want to here that shit, so please just tell me how much do you think i lose.... 56 days people. thank you for the time
When you faint from starvation, the nurses will pump you full of calories via IV. Just thought you should know. If you actually go through with your plan, by day eleven you will probably collapse. So that gives the nurses plenty of time to destroy your plan. So just don't faint until day 57, and you'll be all set. Good luck with that."

2,"what began the pliocene epoch?

In addition to the Wikipedia answer already given, Episodes: Journal of International Geoscience indicates the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Pliocene as being the base of the Trubi Formation (in Italy). At that location the change in stratigraphy marks the end of the Miocene and the start of the Pliocene. Worldwide climate changes and faunal succession at the time of deposition are among the reasons for a need to place an Epoch boundary at that level. The cause or causes of these changes are still largely speculation.\n\nThe primary marker for global correlation for this boundary is the insolation cycle (a cycle of well documented long term changes in the amount of energy reaching earth from the sun). Secondary markers include paleomagnetics (changes in the earths magnetic field recorded in the Earth's crust), along with the first appearance of some nannofossils and foraminifera and the disappearance of others. \n\nSo the simple answer is the same for this boundary as most other geological boundaries. Global changes in climate and life forms. Interestingly, changes you can observe the Earth undergoing at the present will likely make enough of a mark in the future geological record to deserve a new Geologic Period if not a whole new Geologic Era."

3,"What is serotonin syndrome?

I've cut and pasted this information from the link below.  If you want to see the tables, follow the link.  For more information, try a google search and you'll get tons of responses.\n\nSerotonin syndrome is described in the literature as a potentially serious drug-related condition characterized by a number of mental, autonomic and neuromuscular changes.1 Although serotonin syndrome can cause death, the condition is mild in most persons, and with supportive care alone they tend to recover completely. The syndrome, first described in animal models in the 1950s, was referred to as the ""serotonin behavioral"" or ""hyperactivity syndrome.""1 Reports of serotonin syndrome in humans followed, and have become increasingly frequent since the 1960s. The earliest reports involved persons who were taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Some of the early reports included patients who were also taking tryptophan, a serotonin precursor.1,2\n\nSerotonin syndrome is most often reported in patients taking two or more medications that increase CNS serotonin levels by different mechanisms. The most common drug combinations associated with serotonin syndrome involve the MAOIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the tricyclic antidepressants.3 Because of the dramatic rise in the use of SSRIs, it is predicted that emergency room physicians are going to encounter the serotonin syndrome more frequently than in the past.1\n\nSerotonin Syndrome Risk Factors\n\nRisk factors for the development of serotonin syndrome are unclear, but some trends are becoming apparent as more cases appear in the literature. Some researchers have suggested that peripheral vascular disease and atherosclerosis may lead to severe vasospasm and hypertension in the presence of elevated serotonin levels. This seems paradoxical, since in peripheral areas of the body serotonin usually causes vasodilation. However, in patients with vascular disease serotonin can lead to profound vasoconstriction.6 \n\nAnother risk factor relates to drug metabolism rate. Slow metabolizers of SSRIs (approximately 7% of the population) may produce higher than normal levels of these antidepressants in the blood. A slow metabolizer receiving an SSRI in combination with another agent that raises serotonin levels is therefore at increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome.6\n\nClinical Features and Differential Diagnosis\n\nMental status changes are the most frequently reported symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome.2 Other commonly reported features include motor abnormalities, cardiovascular changes, gastrointestinal problems and miscellaneous changes such as diaphoresis and fever (TABLE 1).2,4 Martin refers to three categories of symptoms that are present: altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction and neuromuscular abnormalities.1 Sporer indicates that at least three of the following must be present for a diagnosis: mental status changes, agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, fever (hyperpyrexia), shivering, diaphoresis, ataxia and diarrhea in the setting of a recent addition or increase in dose of an agent that raises serotonin levels. Sporer also points out that there should be no other obvious causes of the confusion and/or fever, and that no antipsychotic medications have been used or increased in dose prior to the onset of symptoms.3\n\nPoisonings and other diseases, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), can cause symptoms that are very similar to serotonin syndrome (TABLE 3). Martin offers suggestions that may be useful in differentiating serotonin syndrome from these conditions. One is an observation that bromocriptine has been proposed as a treatment for NMS and a cause or precipitant of serotonin syndrome. Another is that NMS occurs from prolonged exposure to neuroleptic agents or withdrawal of dopamine agonists, and there is lead-pipe rigidity with NMS, in contrast to myoclonus or hyperreflexia seen in persons with serotonin"
2,"In what general ways would the development of a starfish zygote differ from that of an amphibian or bird? Why?

I don't think you mean development of the zygote....that is a fertilized egg.  Do you mean all the embryological stages after fertilization? There are similarities and differences in all three of these organisms' embryology.\n\nThe starfish zygote and amphibian zygote are both slimy-jelly coated and are vulnerable to fungus-bacterial infections in the water they are laid in, and vulnerable to being eaten by misc hungry aquatic organisms. These eggs are laid and fertilized as a result of external fertilization in the water.  Starfish just release the gametes in the water at a specific time in breeding season without a mating act per se.  If you are standing on a hill above a tidepool while groups of male and female starfish shed their gametes you can see the cloudiness in the water from the huge quantities of sperm and egg they release quasi-synchronistically. \n\nFrogs and other amphibians actually have a mating act called amplexus. The male does all the ribbiting to audition for the job of dna donor.  If she is ok with it, he jumps on the back of the female and he squeezes her eggs out while he releases his sperm on them. Starfish zygotes go thru many many larval stages-metamorphoses (they are part of zooplankton) and eventually mature to the adult on the tidepool rocks.  The bipinnaria larva of echinoderms are famous for their DEUTEROSTOMATE development like other vertebrates-chordates (see below)!\n\nAmphibian zygotes eventually turn into ONE aquatic tadpole larval stage which uses gills and then grow appendages-lungs to be eventually become more terrestrial.  \n\nAmphibians do not have an amnion in their eggs and are therefore anamniotes. Birds and reptiles produce ""land eggs"" that can resist dessication pretty well and are therefore called AMNIOTES, those who have the amniotic sac to help protect the developing embryo from the drying air on land. The amniotic fluid is in the amniotic sac. Mammals can lay eggs (monotremes) but most are placental mammals who have the amniotic sac in the uterus, but amnion and amniotic fluid with the fetus is not inside a shelled egg like the birds and reptiles.So placental mammals are the most advanced amniotes\n\nOne way these three embryo types do NOT differ: starfish and amphibian and bird are all ""deuterostomate"" animals.  . All animals you listed on your question are deuterostomate. Most invertebrates are ""protostomes. So it is said to be an evolutionary LINK, that the echinoderm-starfish bipinnaria larva shows deuterostomate embryology! ""Proto means ""first,"" deutero means ""last"" and stom means ""mouth."" Again, both echinoderm bipinnaria larva and chordates-vertebrates (amphibians and birds) are deuterostomate. \n\nWhen embryos change from blastulas to gastrulas, there is an early indentation-invagination process of the tissue to begin the formation of endoderm and the future GI tract from MOUTH to ANUS.  In protostomates, most invertebrates except the echinoderm-starfish group, the mouth is formed first at the first indentation or invagination of blastula to become gastrula, and the anus is formed last.  \n\nIn the deuterostomates, the mouth is formed last and the anus is formed first.  The Echinoderms which includes the starfish, are deuterosomates like the chordates (bird and amphibian), including us humans. Aren't you glad you now know that your anus formed before your mouth?"

Yes there is usually some redness for a day or two.  Generally it takes several treatments to get a good result.  Only the hairs that are in the active growth cycle are killed with the treatment.  Since a third of your hair foolicles are dormant at any time, we generally tell people to return every 6 weeks or so to optimize the number of hairs we catch in the growth phase.

3,"Should urine be more acidic or alkaline in order to prevent Urinary Tract Infections?

Urine pH as measured by urinalysis has a normal range of about 4.5-8 with a pH of 6 being the average. Neutral pH is 7. Anything having a lower pH is acidic and anything with a higher pH is basic. \nUrine is actually a fairly good growth medium for bacteria and is sometimes used in labs for this pupose. However urine with a lower pH (more acidic) has been found to inhibit the growth of bacteria. \nUrine that is high in ammonia on the other hand with its higher pH (more alkaline or basic) has been found to impede the bodies immune responce to a UTI. In fact Proteus species of bacteria which is a common cause of UTIs produces a substance called urease which breaks down uric acid (an end product of nitrogen metabolism found in urine) into ammonia and carbon dioxide, thus causing the urine to become more basic. The ability of Proteus of produce urease increases its ability to cause pylonephritis (infection of the kidney as opposed to the blatter or ureters).\nTaking substances that will alter the pH of your urine however may have unforseen side effects. The pH of the urine helps determine what is and what is not filtered out of the blood by the kidney. Also altering the pH will have an effect of the formation of kidney stones. Certain particles will become ""un-dissolved"" at a higher pH and some at a lower pH. If enough of the particles come out of solution, you will get kidney stones. In fact the Proteus bacteria that cause the urine to become more basic are associated with an increase in kidney stones.\nI general however pH has very little to do with get or not getting a UTI. The urinary tract from the distal urethra up is mostly sterile and the few bacteria that do get into the urinary tract are usually flushed out when you urinate. Some bacteria however such as E. coli have molecules on thier outer membrane that can adhere to the urinary tract lining. It can do this reguardless of pH and pH in general has little effect on E. coli which is what causes about 85% of UTIs not contracted in a hospital. E. coli is found in the digestive tract and most UTIs are caused when the E. coli finds its way into the urinary tract. While in the digestive tract the E. coli has had to endure the extremely acidic pH of the stomach and the very basic pH of the small intestine.\nMost bacteria that cause UTIs are from the digestive tract. Often they are aided in migration to the urethra by sexual intercourse. The use of spermicides is associated with an increase in UTIs because the protective bacteria of the vagina are killed by the spermicide and this leave the vagina vulnerable to colinization by UTI causing bacteria.\nAlso some women are genetically predisposed to UTI because they have more adhesion molecules on their vaginal walls.\nCranberry juice is helpful in preventing UTI. Studies have shown that cranberry juice inhibits the ability of bacteria to adhere to the urinary tract.\nIf recurrent UTIs are a problem you may want to speak to you doctor about methanamine. It is used to prevent UTIs especially those caused by E. coli which is the most common cause of UTIs."
2,"can someone clearly explain the difference between the principle of segregation and independent assortment?
I'm having a little trouble on that
Mendel's First Law (Segregation) states that during gamete formation, each member of an allelic pair (the two 'copies' of a gene) separates from the other member and forms the ""genetic supply"" of the gamete. That is to say, as each allele is on one of a pair of homologous chromosomes, they will separate from each other during meiosis. \nThis may appear as very basic, but the realization that there were _pairs_ of ""factors"" (the term 'allele' did not exist in Mendel's time) that separated and then could combine was important because until then, it was thought that inheritance meant some kind of ""blend"" between elements from both parents. It was very difficult to figure out how, for instance, a flower color that skipped a generation and then appeared again could remain as a discrete element (the reasoning was: if I mix red and white plants, I'll get plants with rose color. Mixing rose with red or white should yield lighter or darker color, but not the originals).\n\nThe Second Law (Independent Assortment) can only be understood when studying _more than one_ allelic pair. The simplest case is the dihybrid cross, in which you analyze the outcome of a cross with respect to 2 different allele pairs. What Mendel found is that the segregation of the alleles of one allelic pair is independent of the segregation of the alleles of another allelic pair. That is to say, if one pair codes for flower color and the other for seed size, in the 2nd generation you will get all the possible combinations of these allele pairs. Remember we're talking of genotypes and _not_ phenotypes (that is, all the alleles will be present, but some will not be 'visible'). \nThe 2nd law works perfectly when the pairs of alleles in question are situated on different chromosomes. If the two pairs are on the same chromosome, there are more possibilities of certain combinations to occur; this is called genetic linkage."

Anything outside is at normal time and speed obviously.\n\nTheoretically, if you travel 30 mins out into space at the speed of light and travel back to earth, you're only an hour old (by the way, at that speed, you've traveled an equivalent of six of our solor systems).  However, as you return to earth get ready to meet your great great grandson.\n***\nI don't know why.\nIf I did I'd own this freaking corporation.  *L*"

2,"If it is 65 degrees in the house, we feel cold, but 65 degrees outside would feel WARM. Why?
(This question applies to those of us in the cold weather areas of the U.S., where it is currently about 20 degrees F.)
Sun on your skin can make you warmer than the ambiant tempurature. When you are outside you feel the sunlight in addition to the 65 degrees.\n\nAlso, your body measures warmth in relations to experiences.  Your body knows what normal room temp feels like.  If its colder than that, you feel cold.  Same when you go outside.\n\nI hope that all made sense."

2,"Why the ozone layer is more depleted over antartica where there is no pollution?

The Recipe For Ozone Loss\n\nTo summarise then, we have looked at the 'ingredients' or conditions necessary for the destruction of ozone that we see in Antarctica. The same applies more or less to the loss of ozone in the Arctic stratosphere during winter. Although in this case the loss is not nearly so severe.\n\nTo recap then, the requirements for ozone loss are:\n\nThe polar winter leads to the formation of the polar vortex which isolates the air within it.\n\nCold temperatures form inside the vortex; cold enough for the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs). As the vortex air is isolated, the cold temperatures and the PSCs persist.\n\nOnce the PSCs form, heterogeneous reactions take place and convert the inactive chlorine and bromine reservoirs to more active forms of chlorine and bromine.\n\nNo ozone loss occurs until sunlight returns to the air inside the polar vortex and allows the production of active chlorine and initiates the catalytic ozone destruction cycles. Ozone loss is rapid. The ozone hole currently covers a geographic region a little bigger than Antarctica and extends nearly 10km in altitude in the lower stratosphere."

2,"do you think it's life on Europa , a satellite of Jupiter?

Europa is unlike any other body in the solar system, it is not jupiters smallest moon rather the smallest of the galilean moons of jupiter with a diameter of 3100km. Its surface is among the brightest in the solar system, a consequence of sunlight reflecting off a relatively young icy crust. Its face is also among the smoothest, lacking the heavily cratered appearance characteristic of Callisto and Ganymede. Lines and cracks wrap the exterior. If you were to scale Europa down it would probably be a smooth as a billiard ball. Scientists believe that beneath Europa's icy surface lies a liquid ocean which has the possibility of harbouring life. Let me make myself clear, we're not talking about intelligent life, but rather life that could be very similar to what is found at the bottom of our oceans. I personally believe that there could be some form of microbial life lying somewhere down there. \n\nNASA is planning to send a probe to Europa hopefully in 2015. Thinsprobe will land and have a device that will either melt or drill its way through the ice layer which could be a extensive a 10 to 15km. Once through the probe will launch a second probe which will act as a submarine and explore Europa's oceans. The Galileo spacecraft which arrived at Jupiter in 1994 confirmed that there is a liquid, briny ocean at some depth below Europa’s surface. It would also be an environment in which primitive unicellular organisms, called extremophiles on Earth, might be able to survive. \n\nAs a result, any mission planned to land on Europa will have to pass extremely strict “planetary protection” qualifications in order to prevent the contamination of Europa by Earth organisms. \n\nAs a marine scientist and a person with a huge passion for astronomy, Europa is one of the most exciting bodies in the solar system. The things that could be learnt from this moon are endless and scientist are very eigar to try and draw comparisons to the earths oceans, but if there one thing the universe has taught us is to always expect the unexpected."

2,"using uniform distribution; diet varies between 5 & 10 Ibs. what is probability that more than 9 Ibs are lost?

Uniform distribution? So if 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 lbs of loss are all statistically equal, then since there are 6 'numbers' of weight loss, the probability would be 1/6. Think about when you flip a coin: heads or tails. Two options. Odds of it landing heads is 1/2. Same goes for tails of course."
2,"does osteomyelitis spread in the bone/s once it has become chronic?

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection commonly caused by the Staphylococcus aureus organism. There is, believe it or not, an effective treatment for it should antibiotics not prove to be successful. \nMacrophage therapy (Bacteriophage therapy) has been used in Eastern Europe for many years and with great success in the treatment of certain infections. Although it has its limitations, it does seems to work well with bone infections. \nTry doing a search on this and learn something about it. Perhaps if enough of us made enough noise about this, it would be looked upon as a favorable alternative in America. In the meantime, if one is seeking treatment, a trip to the Institute of Macrophage Therapy in Tsiblisi, Russia should be considered.\nThe large pharmaceuticals would probably have an interest in it if it were a patentable process."
1,"Have U ever had an 'emotional affair'?
Have u ever had an emotional affair.. ?  Was is 2 sided or 1 sided ?  Did it remain strictly emotional- or did it ultimately turn physical?
Well, that depends on how 'emotional affair' is defined.... but I believe that I have had one.  \n\nMine seemed to be 2 two sided at first but became increasingly 1 sided as time went on.  It also went from only emotions to becoming physical, which made my emotional attachment even stronger.  \n\nI don't think I really loved the man, but I would have done anything to keep him in my life.  In fact, if I had the opportunity, I would still take him back.\n\nI think an emotional affair begins because someone, like myself, has been so emotionally deprived for so long that they react in the extreme the first time someone feeds into what they are so hungry for."
2,"How do you know if a molecule is polar or has polar bonds?

A molecule is polar when it has a dipole moment that does not cancel out. For example, consider the molecule CH4 (methane) which is nonpolar. It has a carbon atom bonded to 4 hydrogen atoms. Bonding is the overlap of the electron density. So you have an electron from a hydrogen and an electron from the carbon forming each of the bonds. Carbon is just very slightly more electronegative (tendency of pulling electrons closer to itself) than hydrogen. This means that the electrons are pulled by carbon away from hydrogen, but not by much (the difference is very very small). This shifting of electron density allows for the carbon to be slightly more negatively charged and hydrogen slightly electron deficient. This makes the C-H bond just slightly polar. However, because there are 4 hydrogen atoms that are bonded to the carbon, this bond polarity cancels each other out...meaning that the bonds are slightly polar, but the overall molecule is nonpolar. \n\nTo determine if the bonds are polar you just have to know the electronegativity differences. To know if a molecule is polar, you must know the correct geometry. Since electrons are negatively charged and repel each other, they want to be as far away from each other as possible. If you have a carbon bonded to 4 hydrogens, you will have a tetrahedral geometry with the hydrogens 109.5 degrees apart from each other creating the best possible arrangement. Also, if you have a lone pair of electrons, then the molecule will always be polar because of that charge separation."

2,"What is aerodynamics? How does it work?

Aerodynamics is a branch of fluid dynamics concerned with the study of gas flows. The solution of an aerodynamic problem normally involves calculating for various properties of the flow, such as velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as a function of space and time. Understanding the flow pattern makes it possible to calculate or approximate the forces and moments acting on bodies in the flow. This mathematical analysis and empirical approximation form the scientific basis for heavier-than-air flight.\n\nAerodynamic problems can be classified in a number of ways. The flow environment defines the first classification criterion. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane, the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket or the flow of air over a hard drive head are examples of external aerodynamics. Internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe."
2,"does anyone not believe in the theory of plate tectonics? If not, why?

I agree with the above posters that Plate Tectonics is a theory that has achieved a broad scientific consensus, and that there is no debate about its general accuracy among geologists. But that doesn't really answer your question, does it?\n\nThe answer to your question is ""yes,"" lots of people don't believe in Plate Tectonics, or at least don't believe in the scientific theory of plate tectonics as understood by geologists. These people are Creationists. If you believe the earth is only 5,000 years old, you can't well believe the continents spent 5 billion years drifting to their current locations. (Well, I guess you could, it's not much of a stretch compared to the rest of creationism. </editorial opinion>). \n\nSo Creationists tend to not believe the continents move at all, or to come up with alternative, Biblically consistent alternate theories to try to reconcile observable facts with their religion. They come up with things like ""catastrophic plate tectonics,"" a non-scientific creationist theory that during Noah's flood, the continents moved 3,000 miles apart in a couple of months and then stopped."

Yeast is part of the normal flora of the vagina.  For various reasons, it can colonize and overgrow and cause a whitish, odorless, cottage cheese-like discharge.  Some of the reasons for overgrowth are, sitting around in a wet bathing suit after going in a hot tub, high consumption of sugar or sugar laden drinks, and wearing underwear made of nylon or non-breathable fabrics.

2,"The light reactions of photosynthesis take place ___?____.?
answers:  in the thylakoid membrane , in the cytosol , in the stroma , on the cristae or in the inner membrane .
The light reaction happens in the thylakoid membrane and converts light energy to chemical energy. This chemical reaction must, therefore, take place in the light. Chlorophyll and several other pigments such as beta-carotene are organized in clusters in the thylakoid membrane and are involved in the light reaction. Each of these differently-colored pigments can absorb a slightly different color of light and pass its energy to the central chlorphyll molecule to do photosynthesis. The central part of the chemical structure of a chlorophyll molecule is a porphyrin ring, which consists of several fused rings of carbon and nitrogen with a magnesium ion in the center."

hi there, i have had natural long nails since your age and i just want you to know if you take this route you will be very upset when one breaks, you will even consider yourself clumsy.  it takes a graceful person with hardly anything physical(handwise) to do. i was a ballarina for most my youth so this is what i spent 6 + hours a day doing, not out with friends going to parties getting my nails broken because i opened a can beer without an opener or  boyfriend doesn't open the door for you.  the list goes on and on.   One more thing in life to worry about and to be pisst about.  but wait the good news,  long nails are easy to grow, if you always concentrate on them.  imagine thinking about your nails all day!  when you reach about 20 or so, 8 yrs thinking about your nails it will be second nature hence you no doughtfully will be very graceful as well.  long beautiful nails take alot of care, not from a nail lady but from you.  i would never dream of letting anyone touch my nails with a emery board.  i drink lots of water,  eat right, vitamines,  hands are always very nourished with oils and lotions, i wear special gloves when ever at home and every evening i put a clear coat on.  having long beautiful nails requires products, just like long beautiful hair.   the good news is how wonderful my hands look compaired to everyone elses.  men automatically treat you different, like a lady.  but you don't need long nails for that if you are a true lady, right?  \nno product on nails - sorry babe but you will have dried our crack ugly nails.

3,"What is the best way to DETOX in a HEALTHY and SAFE way??

There is no such thing as a ""detoxification"".  These are all fraudulant.\n\nYour body naturally eliminates toxins through various means.  The idea here is to limit/eliminate most toxins and allow your body to do its job and not to do things that interfere with this process.  For example, drinking alcohol, even a little bit, regularly, will dramatically decrease your liver function, preventing it from detoxifying most things in your body.  In extreme cases, all those toxins running around in your body will result in extreme cluster headaches....one of the common forms of headaches people experience.  Stop drinking and the problem disappears...duh.\n\nEat a healthy diet, free of processed foods, and additives like MSG and nutrasweet, and drink only water.  That is the ONLY way to detoxify your body.\n\nAlso, a good source of anti-oxidants like grape seed extract will prevent free radicals from mucking around your body and causing disease.\n\nFor example.  Atherosclerosis is caused when cholesterol in your body is oxidized by free radicals, which then adheres to your artery wall, where it calcifies.  Antioxidants prevent this.  If you interupt the process long enough, your body has a mechansim (not well understood) for removing those plaques.\n\nThe practical application of this knowledge is you can prevent atherosclerosis (and a whole bunch of other nasty diseases) by ""detoxifying"" your body of free radicals with anti-oxidants....provided you arn't stuffing garbage into your body 24/7.\n\nIn fact, the new classification of drugs for reversing atherosclerosis are powerful anti-oxidants.  They were developed to prevent restenosis after angioplasty but have been found to reverse athersclerosis all by themselves.  How do they work?  By interupting the process that causes atherosclerosis (oxidation of cholesterol) and restensosis after angioplasty, allowing your body to naturally heal the atherosclerosis on its own.\n\nThis is similar to how drugs like Fosamax work for oseoporosis.  You have cells that break down bone and cells that build up bone.  Osteoporosis happens when the net break down is greater than the net build up.  Fosamax slows down the cells that break down bone allowing the cells that build up bone to ""catch up"".  Over a few years time, this cures the condition.\n\nMOST long term, chronic disease follows this model.  If you interupt the ongoing disease process, your body ""catches up""\n\nSame thing with toxins."
1,"which came first - dinosaurs or adam and eve?
science says that dinosaurs were here long before people,  but the bible says that god made everything in a week. so if everything was made in a week, that would mean that there was only a couple of day between the two. what do you think?
I don't really know which was first, but I would have to guess dinosaurs.  Remember, that one of God's weeks is probably not a week to us.  There are some rules on time in the Bible, and in one scripture (can't remember where it is in the Bible), one day for God is a thousand years for us."

when area is increase ,the volume get increase so pressure should decrease.because velocity increases
its basically how u see the question.\nin fluid dynamics, eq of continuity specifies that a*v = constant so with inc in area, velocity decreases,hence pressure increses\n\nwhile in solids, the case is not the same , pressure = force/area hence assuming force constant with inc in area, pressure must dec"

3,"Is there anything women can do for hair loss that really works and doesn't cost a ton of money?
I'm to young for my hair to be falling out at the rate that I'm going I wont hardly have any left when I reach my forties. I stress about really bad every time I go to fix my hair. I try not to do to much with my hair because it worry about it so much.
Many people don't realize that hair loss is a problem, even for women. It is particularly distressful, and I sympathize with you since you've already got a plate full of stressors. The good news is there is help. There are all kinds of medical remedies available. If you're serious about remedying hair loss, see your doctor. You can also take steps to preserve the hair your have. One easy thing, only comb your hair from roots to ends. Anything else tangles and then pulls out hair in the detangling process. Follow this pattern also when you wash and condition your hair. Also, keep your hair cut short as weight will also increase fallout. Finally, Mane and Tail shampoo seem to help, and some judicious use of hair gel will make the hair you have seem thicker. \n\nBeyond all of that, find a way to squeeze some time for yourself into your hectic schedule. Do something that relaxes you -- read a book, window shop with a friend, just sit and enjoy a cup of coffee on the porch. You have to take care of yourself or all of your body systems will suffer. Believe me, I've been there. Take care of you so you are able to take care of the important relationships you have -- with your children. \n\nSending you tons of good wishes,\n~Tia~"
7,"What is the current state of the market for on-demand software?
I am writing a marketing plan for class based on an on-demand software offering (think Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Basecamp).  How much is the market worth?  How fast is it growing?  How many consumers or small businesses are involved? etc...
On Demand Software (ODS) is much more popular than people think, simply because the concept of on demand software has been ill defined and is generally concieved ad limited to ""Net Licensing"" Here are a couple of recommendations to round out your research paper.\n\n1) Start by breaking the mold: Define ODS in it´s full conception. On Demand is a service definition not a product spec. The whole idea behind On demand, is to have your service when you need it. Bluntly put, almost all net transactions and particularly all DOWNLOADS are delivered on demand. so the biggest consumer of ODS is really the home end user, and the real market is in the ""Upgrade and fringe bennefit"" segment of ODS rather than the ""Full Service application""\n\nThe best example of this (other than the all powerfull i Tunes) is probably the MS Office Clipart gallery, absolutely on demand, but dellivering only a fraction of all the suite's functionalities.\n\n2) Proove the market assumptions before you measure the market. as the old saying states, ""to assume is to make an A** out of U and ME"" so before you bring out your calculator and start adding customers Proove the real motivation behind each consumer and service segments.\n\nSome less looked at segments may be ""Patches"", ""Demos"" ""Add ons"", ""Advertising on Demand (Which actually acounts for most of the profit of web based e'mail)""\n\nThen there is the classics ""WEB MAIL"" as the king of the ODS software services, which led to ""CONTACT MANAGEMENT"" and ""SCHEDULING"" ""MEETING MANAGEMENT and MESSAGING"" Services, then and only then consider SUITE Services and ERPs which are at the pinnacle of complexity and thus have a smaller segment.\n\nIf you can make a case for each relevant service segment you will see that your customer count is high, composed of many interdependent market response surfaces. \n\n3) Round out by explaining some of the unique attributes of the ODS business model such as. . .\n\nA) the money is in the service not just the license fee. . explain how service creates and audience and the audience creates a media profit (Once again the case of web based e'mail)\n\nB) A different service calls for different measures. .  the importance of measuring transactions and consumers, badwidth and feature richness.\n\nC) Data management builds uncontested loyalty. (ask how much you value your information, thats how much you will want to stay once you decide on an ODS service provider.)\n\n4) Last measure the size of the market according to simple facts. If your cost to run is $1,000,000/mo and your profit margin per account user is $10/mo Than your real market is the top 100,000 consumer over the total response surface of the features in your ODS platform."

My husband and I have been trying to have our second child for almost a whole year.  I had all of my periods this year except for August, October and November.  I have been going to the bathroom every five seconds it seems like and my breasts are a little tender.  I know this sounds bad but I am afraid to take a pregnancy test for the fear of it being negative.  What do you think I should do?
If I were you I would take the test because if your pregnant you need to know. You need to start taking the vitamins and going to the doctor for check-ups and everything. If your not pregnant just keep trying and if you still have problems getting pregnant go to your doctor and get put on the medication that helps a woman to get pregnant. Good luck to you."

i used to be so shy, until i found my now best friend. she was so confident and encouraged me to do the same. maybe try and find friends on your own, so you aren't relying on your now friends to have a good time. Make conversation with a person in a bar or pub, thats usually a good way to get more confident, and if it doesnt work out then you can just leave it at that!\n\ndo things in public that you wouldn't normally do, like singing and dancing when messing about with friends.  Most of the problem is that you are thinking of what others think of you.

Are they the same person n diff names in diff languages?
no.way. there are very fundamental differences in teachings. krishna is much more rich philosophy. i am not saying this as a hindu. just read Bhagvat Gita. even a few verses will make u get that.\n\nthe most striking feature is while moses talks about chosen people(i guess he was the firs to coin that idea) and only true god and that thou shall not bow b4 any other god than me.....\n\nkrishna says ""those who pray with devotion to another god, it is to Me that they pray."" \neven those who worship other gods (anyadevatah), ancestral deities, elemental powers, if they do so with faith, then their faith is justified, for the Divine accepts every form conceived by the worshipper. \n krishna started the theory of Karma.\n\n krishna was not raised as prince though he was one. he was raised by a village chief . the only similarity is that kansa, his uncle tried to kill him because of a profecy that devaki's son (krishna) will kill him ultimately. so first he killed all his brothers at the time of their birth. but  his father was successfull in smuggling him out declaring him stillborn.. when kansa found out that he ordred that all new born children should be killed in that area. \n\n the truth is that original story of krishna had many colors added to it. the story of child masecar could have been borrowed later."

Hi,im new and im a High School Student in my Junior year. My biggest problem is im very embarresed when my stomach starts making noises and stuff.I try to eat alot of food to compensate for it but it dosent work that well.I can eat 3 eggs with 3 peices off whole wheat toast with apple juice for breakfast and be hugry about 4 hours later.People my age can go without breakfast,and eat a regular lunch.When i eat breakfast and lunch,i can barely make it to the end of the day without my stomach growling.Its really embarising and i want to know if there are anyways to supress appitite indefinatly.My father used to eat alot,and now he dosent get hungry that much cause hes been eating healty,but thats cause hes been doing it for a couple of years.I need something quicker.Im thinking about getting the new appitite suppresant HoodiaGordonii.I also have Hypothyroidism(which i would think would make me less hungry).If you can help me that would be great cause it's really effecting my life.
You're hungry four hours later? That's no surprise! That's a long time to go without food when you are growing. And you are still growing. You need more calories.\n\nI used to get embarrassed when my stomach would growl in class when I was in high school, too. Everyday in algebra. I know it's embarrassing now, but, you know what? In a few years no one will remember. Besides, everyone knows that people get hungry. And you are not the first person whose stomach has grumbled. :-)\n\nHaving 5 small meals a day can curb your hunger better than having the traditional 3 meals a day. Do you have some time in your schedule for a midday snack? Is there any chance of having a quick snack between classes? \n\nSomething fibrous and filling might help: an apple, granola bar. Or something that will give your stomach something to work on for a while: cheese, meat.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you are eating breakfast. You might also try something more filling for breakfast: oatmeal, peanut butter on your toast...\n\nDon't bother with appetite suppressants. That's crazy. Also, you have a condition. I don't think you want to mess with medications that might affect your metabolism.\n\nYour dad also probably doesn't get hungry because he is older and doesn't need as many calories as you do. Talk with your parent(s). Maybe you'll get some ideas from them.\n\nGood luck. I hope that you won't let this affect your life too much. It will pass. You won't be in high school forever. Keep the big picture."

We are all 6 in our department in our office and we usually eat together during lunch, one of my co-worker is a very talkative, even while eating, while he has a food all loaded in his mouth. And it really annoys me, and he talks like there is a megaphone stuck up his throat. WHICH REALLY SUCKS.
Many times a person who needs to be loud in conversation or the ""Know-it-all"" type, or the type that seems to not allow others to talk...is a person who is insecure and feels very low about themselves.  Their loud boisterous opinions and lack of being able to let others in on the conversation says that that person needs extra attention and has very poor communication skills.  Trying to tell them to ""shut up"" is NOT going to get the point across.  As a matter of fact...it might worsen the objective.  Perhaps if you make copy of this answer with your question and quietly and in private present it to this person...you may get somewhere.  Start with a ""Hey...(his name)...can I please talk to you for a moment in private.  Then take him aside and let him know that you appreciate his input on things...however..""I'd like to let you know that there are people who have some input into the many conversations we have...as we have listened to you...perhaps you would be fair to listen to what some of us have to say.""  ""And by the way...eating/chewing with your mouth open or full is socially unacceptable...perhaps you didn't realize you were doing this...and as a friend, I thought I might let you know.  \nTwo wrongs never made a right...instead it makes a war.  So treat his rudeness with corrective/non-judgemental kindness and see if a greater response comes from your directives.

2,"Is it true that when you have an itch that it's your body replacing dead cells?
When you get an itch is it true that it's caused by your body replacing dead cells?
an itch is when something causes histamines in your skin cells to be released. then your sensory cells become depolarized and signal to your spinothalamic tract. itches are controlled by your spinal cord if i recall from anatomy class, because it is not really needed to be noticed by your cortex. if you noticed every single itch in your cortex you would most definetly go insane. \nanti-histamines are usually in allergy medication to relieve itchiness.\nim pretty sure you might scratch hard enough to remove cells, but i dont think scratching is used for removing dead cells.\nthis might be a a bit vague or not quite correct but its the best i could remember."

I once tried to catch my girlfriends cat. It ran off towards the abandoned grain elevators by the railroad tracks, so I followed. On the catwalk between the grain elevators I saw a shadow like form that was about 10 ft. tall and about 6 ft. wide. Closer inspection revealed it to be a solid form and by no means a shadow. It was pure black, hence my originally thinking it to be a shadow. Something that size in no way could be human. It stopped as if looking at me(I was a good 20 ft away) then walked across the catwalk into the grain elevator that exploded years ago. I did the natural thing in that case, ran like hell and never looked back. I had heard ghost stories about the place but that looked nothing like a ghost to me.

The air inside a balloon is exerting pressure on the outside of the balloon. When the air escapes, that pressure is concentrated in one direction. the fast moving air near the opening strengthens pressure on the current of air, and so it pushes the balloon forward. This is also expressed in Newton's Third Law of Motion."

Two 2.00 kg masses are connected by a 50.0 cm long rod of negligible mass.  This rod can rotate in the vertical plane around a horizontal rotation axis through its middle.  Initially assume the rod is balanced and sitting along the horizontal as shown below.  Suddenly a 50.0 g spider drops onto one of the masses with a speed of 3.00 m/s.  (a) What is the angular speed of the system just after the spider lands? (b)  What is the fraction of kinetic energy after the spider lands to just before it lands?  (c) Through what angle will the system rotate before coming to rest?
This problem satisfies the conservatin of momentum law but not conservation of kinetic energy since it is an inelastic collision.\n\nSolving \nm1*v1=m2*v2\nm1*v1/m2=v2\n3*.05/4.05\n=.0371m/s\ndivide by the radius for radians/sec\n=.0371/.25 m/s\n\nFor the angular displacement, conservation of energy is held, so the rotation down and back to horizontal will result in the same energy as when the spider landed, so the spider's weight times vertical displacement will be the height of the spider before equilibrium:\n\n1/2*m*v^2=m(spider)*g*h\n.5*4.05*.0371^2/(.05*9.8)=h\nh=.0057 m\n\nwith this we can compute the angle above horizontal\nsin(theta)=.0057/.025\ntheta =13.18 degrees\nso  the spider rotated through\n90+13.18\n=103.18 degrees\n\nSorry for the previous incorrect answer using conservation of energy for the collision.\n\nj"
2,"What`s a pheromone?

A pheromone is any chemical or set of chemicals produced by a living organism that transmits a message to other members of the same species. There are alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, sex pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented, although many vertebrates and plants also communicate using pheromones. The existence of human pheromones is debated.\n\nInsect pheromones of pest species, such as the Japanese beetle and the gypsy moth, can be used to trap them for monitoring purposes or for control by creating confusion, disrupting mating and preventing them from laying eggs. Bombykol is a chemically well characterized pheromone released by the female silkworm to attract mates.\n\nIn mammals and reptiles, pheromones may be detected by the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson's organ, which lies between the nose and mouth, although some are detected by regular olfactory membranes.\n\nTerence McKenna proposed in his book ""Food of the Gods"" the controversial idea of exopheromones as chemical signals between, as opposed to among a single, species. He suggested that certain chemicals produced in abundance in various hallucinogenic plants and fungi, such as dimethyltriptamine and psilocybin may act as pheromones produced by one species (the vegetal) waiting for absorption by various others (for example, early primates or hominids). In this way a kind of ecological pheromonal system may be at work among species and ecosystems that have coevolved closely for long stretches of time."
1,"A question about baptisms vs dedications?
I was baptised Luthren when I was 4 months old. While I was growing up it was always important for this to be done at an early age. Several years ago I pretty muched stopped going to church because I was always working on Sundays so my husband (then boyfriend) started taking my daughter (from a previous relationship) to church with his parents and himself. When I quit my job to stay home and have another baby I decided to start going to his family's church because my duaghter had a bond with the people there since she had been going there for 2 years. Well this church is a Brethern In Christ. When our baby was born I wanted to get all of our girls baptised. Well this church does not baptise they dedicate. Also I wasn't asked to choose Godparents. Long question short, What is the difference, does it have the same spiritual effect and why aren't Godparents a part of it?
Child baptism is a church tradition that was started somewhere in Middle Ages because of high infant mortality. Parents wanted to make sure their children were burried in a christian way and the church would not do that except they were baptised. Godparents were the ones who accepted the responsibility to raise the child in christian ways in case something happened to the parents.\n\nA brethren church believes in biblical baptism - the way John the Baptist did baptise. He baptised the adults, the babies were dedicated at the temple and the parents themselves had in charge to raise the children under jewish tradition.\n\nIt is based on the fact that the baby cannot decide himself if he/she wants to follow the christian faith, so the parents are charged during the dedication to raise the child in a christian way until the age when the child can decide for himself whether wants to live in a christian way: baptism is the outward sign of his decision (something similar with what the lutheran church has for teenagers, called confirmation, did you have it?).\n\nDedication has the same spiritual value as baptism and the parents are in the role of godparents.\n\nI also was baptised as a baby in a traditional church, then I had the confirmation and at 25 I joined a protestant church which had adult baptism and baby dedication - so I got baptised again. It was great."
1,"Why do gay men and women sometimes date same sex partners who act like opposite sex? i.e. butch v. queens...?
If it's just about the person, then could gays date the opposite sex if there was the same mental/personality connection? If it's a genitalia thing, does this imply that homosexual relationships are built primarily upon what a person has in their underwear and, therefore, shallow?  Shallow meaning focusing on sex alone as basis for compatibility.\n\nPlease note:  Not anti-gay, just wondering...And yes, I suppose the same could be said for heterosexual relationships..With that being said, I guess the real question is....Do people focus too much on genitalia in relationships and not enough time on genuineness.
Femininity and masculinity come with different angles. It is actually the aspects of feminity and masculinity, not sloely the presence of either that makes the attractiveness of a person. Actually these labels are TOO comprehensive and are not person-centered. If one really thinks about it, a drag queen can be a total butch queen they are not painted. I have met a few who are. Also, a guy who likes ""guy things"" can have some truly ""girly"" features. In essence there are many hybrids in the gay community just as there are queens and butch men. So, I have to speak from the level that it truly the balance of two people that makes it work and not the ambiguities of external qualties. In our community, they can be overly portayed and very misleading. Therefore its the deeper balance of internal virtues that makes you TRULY appreciate a person, however you must look past what I call ""acute attraction"" to see them. As always, it takes effort. Yet what i understand is there is a dimmension of experience, needs, emotional wavelengths (as well as change) that makes gay men and lesbian women WHO THEY ARE. These things fit into their ""eyes of atraction"". What they need is very much different, because as people they ARE different than opposite-sex partners. Although I can find a woman atttactive, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, I can NEVER have the kind of relationship with a woman beyond being a friend, as I do not like to take leadership and would rather be told what I should do. Therefore, for that very reason, I chose a realtionship with an older man who is 25 years my senior and it has proven to work. We have been togther for almost 2 years now. Where I am physically atracted to guys in thier 20s, for the very same reasons, a realtionship with another guy my age would also likley not work for me. Would an older woman guide me like he has while allowing me to help him? I cant say for sure no, but I can almost suspect that the balance would just not be there. It is so much more than whats in the underwear, so much very much more."

Most of the time people simply adopt the religion of their parents - so for all your Christians out there who preach your particular brand of dogma - you would be Muslim if you had been born to Muslim parents.\nMore important than faith though is geography and wealth or should say wellbeing. Just thank yoursleves that we were born inteh developed world where we have frsh water and food in the fridge - now thats more important thatn any religion."
1,"Was I created from nothing, or have I always existed?
Was Life, or more specifically, was I, created ""creatio ex nihlo"" by a Supreme Being or has it/I always existed, co-eternal with a Supreme Being or Creator?
That which begins ends.\nOnly that which does not have begining does not  end.\nIf you only know your self as body and mind, than you have a beginning and end.\nIf you know yourself as one with the whole, then you are not separate, or different from ""the Supreme Creator"", and the question of being created does not arize.\n\nDo you have the courage to be that big?"
3,"What is the difference between the diagnosis of Sociopath and that of Psychopath?

Unfortunately, neither are actually official diagnoses... \n\n\nAntisocial personality disorder (APD) is a personality disorder which is often characterised by antisocial and impulsive behaviour. APD is generally considered to be the same as, or similar to, the disorder that was previously known as psychopathic or sociopathic personality disorder. Approximately 3% of men and 1% of women have some form of antisocial personality disorder (source: DSM-IV).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR, a widely used manual for diagnosing mental disorders (see also:DSM cautionary statement), defines anti-social personality disorder as a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:\n\n   1. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest\n   2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure\n   3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead\n   4. irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults\n   5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others\n   6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations\n   7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another\n\nThe manual lists the following additional necessary criteria:\n\n    * The individual is at least age 18 years.\n    * There is evidence of Conduct Disorder with onset before age 15 years.\n    * The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of Schizophrenia or a Manic Episode.\n\n\nI would say however, that the above is mostly a 'sociopath'\n\nI would consider a 'psychopath' to have a psychotic disorder, such as \n\n# Brief Psychotic Disorder \n# Delusional Disorder \n# Schizoaffective Disorder \n# Schizophreniform Disorder\n# Schizophrenia \n# Shared Psychotic Disorder \n\n\nBut then, it's very difficult to tell sometimes between psychotic and delusional!\n\nHope that helps!"

Max only wants to sleep, is wheezing when he breaths, has the occasional seizure and is not a happy pup now!!!  The vet wants to run 1 test that will cost approx $1500, however, he is unable to tell us what the problem may be, or how we can help Max for now.  We are at a loss right now as what we can do for our little puppy friend.  Does anyone else have a Maltipoo with these symptoms, or can offer some advice.  Max wont eat and is not his usual happy self.  Desperately looking for help!!!

I used to take my dog to the animal shelter for shots because I couldnt afford the $200 tab annually for just rabies and basic vaccinations. Hope that helps."
2,"What is the approximate size of a black hole with about 5 Solar masses?

A 5 solar mass Black Hole (assuming static, non-rotating, non-acreting) would have a radius of about 15 km.\n\nThe Swartzchild radius gives the radius of a static, non-rotating, non-acreting black hole as:\nR = 2GM/c^2\nA rule of thumb is that the radius is about 3km per solar mass."
7,"how would you find business storage customers?
How to advertise self storage
Most of your customers would be local, or need a place local to where you are to store their possesions if they are outside the area.\n\nThe best way is with newspapers and the phone book.  If your on a busy street, make sure you have a sign that gets noticed.  Any local advertising, such as high school football games or yearbooks, if you can go for it some radio spots or late night tv commercials.  Local newspapers, county papers, and don't forget the auto trade or RV magazines and maybe those free local deli publications for various purposes or those mailer coupon people in your area.  \n\nAdvertising is a cost of doing business, and you need to have a budget as part of your overhead and consideration for what rent you charge.  As a local business owner, check out your local chamber of commerce.  If you can afford a website, contact me.  (ok, maybe uncalled for).\n\nAlso, if you have other friends or aquaintences in the business, ask them what they do.  Sponsor a little league team.  Check out those business card people you see that distribute them in restaurants.  Find out what works best for you.\n\nI'm sure you already know not to limit your customers to people but also other businesses, like seasonal ones, or flea markets that need you kind of service, but I'm sure there are many more."

2,"lim sin5x/sin3x?

If it is the limit as x approaches 0...\n\nThere's a great trick called L'Hopitale's Rule which states that if you plug in the value x is approaching and get 0/0, then you can take the derivative of the top and the derivative of the bottom (not a quotient rule, just straight derivatives) and then try plugging in the value x is approaching.\n\nHere, sin5(0)/sin3(0) is 0/0 so we can use the rule.\n\nDerivative of the top is (-5cos5x) and derivative of bottom is (-3cos3x). So, (-5cos5x)/(-3cos3x) is the result. Now plug in 0 for x. You end up with (-5)(1)/(-3)(1) = 5/3."

2,"During the winter they say to stay warmer you should cover your head--to prevent heat loss. Does the (more)?
theroy work the other way in summer, so if you take off a hat, you will stay cooler?
This is a great question!\n\nIn winter your hat is providing insulation, and trapping the heat from your head, which is warmer than the outside air.  \n\nIn summer, the hat COULD provide insulation from the heat, but only if it is hotter outside than your head.\n\nHowever, our body sweats, and when the sweat evaporates, our skin becomes cooler.  The type of hat we wear in winter would prevent this sweat from evaporating and interfere with our natural cooling.\n\nThis is why a straw or mesh hat is good in the summer.  A summer hat can also provide shade, and if it is a lighter color than your hair, it will reflect more light and help you be cooler due to reflection also.\n\nSo, you will want to where a hat both summer and winter to be comfortable!\n\nMake sure it has a wide brim to provide more shade, and also protect you from sunburn!"
3,"what does it mean to be developmentally handicapped?
It is a learning disability.
Learning disability and developmental handicap are different things, though easily confused.\n\nIn referring to a child it generally means the child is significantly delayed in one or more areas of development - language, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, self help skills, etc.  In some places the term is used until a child is about 8 years of age when the reason for the delay, and the potential degree of the delay, is uncertain or unknown.   The thinking is that by 8 years of age or so the child would have either ""caught up"", or the reason for the delay would be identified and we would know whether the chiid has a mental handicap, autism, Down syndrome, etc.  \n\nMy understanding of ""developmentally handicapped"" is that it is often used as a kinder way of saying mentally handicapped. \n\nA quick way to explain learning disability  is that the individual is usually of average intelligence but for whatever reason has had difficutly with some skills, usually reading, spelling, writing or math.\n\nI hope this is of some help."

Regardless of what supplement you choose, make sure the supplement is ""Chelated"". This means that it is tagged with an amino acid so that your body can actually recognize it, and absorb and use it. Most once a day type vitamin supplements that you can purchase off the shelf at any retail store are not chelated. If you are using a supplement that is not chelated, then you are putting it in one end, and flushing it when it comes out the other! That equates to nothing more than a waste of time and money. I personally have a complete wellness system that I use, and all of my family members use. It has truly impacted my overall health and well-being.

(Your can run an airline with only one plane and only one route)\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nCrafts are EXTREMELY expensive to run/maintain/service\n\nFuel is extremely EXPENSIVE.\n\nPilots wages are EXTREMEMLY expensive.\n\nPolitics and newspaper headlines can SEVERELY DAMAGE your airline business. eg 9/11. \n\nThe industry is EXTREMELY competitive.\n\n\nMajority of your business is from holiday makers/vaccationers every summer and is NEVER guaranteed."

Those are two diferent questions. And the answers depends on your country law and the company that calculates that.  \n\nHere some examples of how they're calculated in my country.\n\nCalculate actuarial gains? \n\nFor example, for an insurance company, you first calculate the present value of the insurance (without gains or administrative costs) and after that you calculate the commercial value of the insurance:\n\nCV=  PV /  (  1 +  G  + AC)\nwhere CV= commercial value\n           PV=present value\n            G= percent of gains\n            AC= percent of administrative costs.\n\nIn almost all actuarial procedures, you calculate first the expected value of the service, and after that the commercial value , just adding the percents that you want to get paid for gains or administrative costs.\n\nIn pension plan Assets, you calculate the value of the pension, and for estimate the unexpected returns (or lost) you use the variance of the pension (that can be calculated in an actuarial form, or just as a variance using old info).\n\nThis is a good page:\n\nwww.soa.org"

Truck is financed thru ford credit and i have made 2 payments as though he had still been making them how can registration be transfered?Insurance is also being paid so can i legally drive it?
Generally, if you are not a surviving joint owner of a vehicle there are two ways to transfer title of a vehicle previously owned solely by the deceased.  Both require official court documentation in order to transfer title. If the vehicle is subject to an abbreviated or standard probate proceeding, only the deceased's personal representative may assign the vehicle. If the vehicle is currently titled in another jurisdiction, you must provide equivalent documentation from that jurisdiction. You must present the following documents to transfer title:\n    * Assignment of ownership executed by the deceased's personal representative.\n    * An authenticated copy of the letters testamentary or administration issued to the representative by an appropriate court.\n    * An application for a new Certificate of Title. (Note: the application must be completed by the person assigned ownership.)\n\nIf the vehicle is subject to a small estate order and is a scheduled asset in the order, only the person in whose name the Probate Division of the Court vests title in the vehicle may assign the vehicle.  You must present the following documents to obtain a title for a vehicle:\n    * Assignment of ownership executed by the person in whose name the probate court vests title.\n    * An authenticated copy of the small estate order.\n    * An application for a new Certificate of Title. (Note: the application must be completed by the person assigned ownership.)\n\nWhen the only assets of a deceased's estate are one (1) or two (2) vehicles, the Register of Wills will administer those assets under the small estate proceedings.  An Attorney specializing in Probate and Estates can assist you.\n\nThe title to a car is a legal certificate of ownership that is produced by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in your State. It contains vital information such as the name and address of the current owner; the make, model, and year of the auto; any lienholders; and the date the vehicle was first sold.  When you sell a car, you sign the title over to the new owner. The new owner must then take the title to the DMV to register the car in his or her name. Then the DMV produces a new title and mails it to the new owner with their information on it.  If you acquired the vehicle because of the death of its owner, the DMV outlines the process to follow to obtain the title to the vehicle if you are not a surviving joint owner. To get a fresh title for a car you'll need to provide the following documents to the DMV: proof of a valid driver's license, proof of vehicle ownership, the value of the vehicle, its mileage, proof of insurance, and proof of inspection."

People might say it is scary because it affects a gland in our brain, but it does really no harm to our brain.Please respond only if you have some knowledge and are not guessing. \n \nAlso, are injections more or less useful AND safe?
Two months ago, I had given this answer to your Q.\nWhat were the points you didn't like or you didn't understand?\nWhat are your criteria for a ""good"" answer?\nI am posting again the answer (copy and paste) and I am waiting for your feedback. Why do you refer especially to the GNC company?\nAre you aware of some studies that they did using aminoacids that could potentially influence growth?\nWere they OTC supplements?\nPlease, let us know and in the mean while have another look to my posting.\nRegards\n\n\nHuman growth hormone is administered in the cure of diseases and not in order to make people taller !\nEvenmore, it is a prescription only medicine acting in a small gland situated in our brain. I think they are used also for the dopping. \nTell me now : would you ever trust to give your child such a medicine that could potentially interact with the surrounding field?\nThen you are talking also about OTC products ; they are food supplements I suppose. I don't know what this kind of products are, but I have to say that I had a bad experience from food supplements sold via networking marketing, last spring.\nSometimes they are not so innocent as they look like; they can cause allergies.\nWhy don't you think to adopt a healthier lifestyle? This will help more effectively in your child's case. And it is also more natural, it has no adverse effects, as medicines do .\nI want to add just this : control obesity! Obese children don't get tall and there is also the scientific explanation for this.\nI think that the answer given previously, be happy with yourself, with what you are was wisdom.\n\n\nI have to add that:\n\n1st: It is not just growth hormone that controls growth; there are also other hormones, like TSH(thyroid stimulating hormone), ACTH(adrenocorticotropic hormone), LH(luteinizing hormone) and FSH(follicle stimulating hormone).\nThe small gland situated in our brain, is called pituitary gland.\n\n2nd: You are talking about injections: they are administered just if a GH deficiency is diagnosed; this involves hospitalizing the child because GH is produced in bursts. This means that we can't have a result from a single measurement of this hormone in a blood sample. We need the result of the measurements of a 24 hour period.\nFrom what you say, your child has not been diagnosed from that.\n\nYour child can find more information , articles suitable for the public and educate himself on the GH issue from the site of the Foundation for human growth. It is a patients organisation.\nhttp://www.hgfound.org/growth.html\nEducating himself, he will understand that he really doesn't need any injections of growth hormone in order to get taller and - hopefully - he will adopt a healthier lifestyle in order to grow well.\nOr - if he prefers - he can navigate in the site of wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/growth_hormone\nTake care on scams! A big research project has started this year in the US that will elucidate some obscure points in the area of food supplements that are on sale for this purpose. \n\nKaterina"

If you atticipate the mobile phone to lose its signal (either from physical obstacles, to far from a transmitter tower, or the frequency is being jammed) an alternative way to detonate a bomb is through an infared signal. However, a line of sight is needed for the reciever to intercept the signal."

A 2.0 ohm and a 4.0 ohm resistor wired in SERIES with a 12 V source\n\n\nA 2.0 ohm and a 4.0 ohm resistor wired in PARALLEL with a 12 V Source
When resistors are in series both have same current, i.e V/(r1+r2) = 12/(2+4) = 2 A\n\np.d across each resistor will be I*R\nSo for 2 ohm resistor p.d is 2 * 2 = 4 V\nFor 4 ohm resistor p.d is 4*2 = 8 V\n\nWhen the reistors are in series the p.d across both is the same, i.e 12 V\n\nCurrent across each resistor is given by V/R\nSo across 2 ohm resistor current = 12/2 = 6A\nAnd across 4 ohm resistor current = 12/4 = 3A\n\nResultant resistance = r1*r2/(r1+r2) = 8/6 = 4/3 ohm"

2,"What is the crop modeling?

Crop modeling enables researchers to integrate knowledge from different disciplines in a quantitative way. That, in turn, helps researchers to understand the underlying processes that determine the behavior of complex agricultural systems. Mathematical models are caricatures of systems made from mathematical equations. Integrating and solving the equations enables a numerical description of the system to be produced. During the first phase of a modeling exercise, the modeler seeks to give names, magnitudes and units to the component parts of the problem. In the second phase of modeling a problem, the processes are described as mathematical functions. In the final phase, 'what if' questions can be asked about the functioning of a system and numerical answers provided. Mathematical models that contain no clear logical link with the basic processes governing the relationship between the system inputs and outputs are unlikely to contribute much of significance to any debate concerning strategic decisions in relation to research management. \n\nModels at different levels of detail are developed to meet different objectives, ranging from a thorough understanding of an existing system to the prediction of crop production in untested conditions. Four types of crop production systems can be distinguished."

Isolation of tummy exercises won't resolve the issue. Most people carry weight around some part of their body. This happens to be your area. You are lucky cause you can hide it! I would suggest to reduce your fat and sugar intake cause that would assist with the diet. \n\nGo running twice a week for two hours.

7,"How should I do to politely reject aggresive offers from friends in MLM (Multi Level Marketing) business?

They're not your friends.  End those 'friendships' and get new friends.  True friends don't need anything from you.  If all they are doing is heckling you because you won't join, or buy things or go to meetings, that isn't friendship.  That's salesmanship.  And, everyone knows you don't go into business with your friends (that is, if you want to remain friends).\n\nSo, when they say you haven't tried an MLM yet, you say to them, ""You don't have to try it a pyramid scheme to know that most people don't make money"".  When they say you're not motivated to go to a 'motivation seminar', tell them, ""You're already so motivated that if you went, you'd become hyperactive"".  Finally, when they get mad when you say, ""No"" and call you stupid, then say to them, ""Stupid is as stupid does, especially by joining an MLM"" and walk away.  When they don't invite you to dinner, go out and find some new people.  That truly means that these people aren't friends (and never were)."

Why is it impossible to breathe through a tube underwater if you are deeper that 33 feet (one atmosphere of pressure)?
At sea level, the pressure the air exerts downward is at 1 atmosphere (normally).  If you decend 32 feet below water, the water pressure acting on you is 1 atmosphere as well, even greater as you go deeper.\n\nWhen you try to suck air down underwater, the water is trying to push it back up.  At some point, you just wont have enough ""sucking power"" to over come the weight of the water."

But it doesn't matter.  Many things are listed in the Bible as an abomination, yet nobody seems to care until gay people want to be left alone.\n\nThe apostle Paul said that christians shouldn't get married, that it was better if they could live celibate lives like he did.  But you don't notice any Christians trying to ban straight marriage.\n\nThe truth is it doesn't matter what the Bible says about homosexuality.  It says so many crazy things that even if it said in clear and precise language that ""god hates fags."" I wouldn't pay it much attention.\n\nIt's not about god or christianity.  It's about people loving people.  Anybody against people loving people doesn't matter."

Most people who have actually studied them think that it is more likely that the object under the snow is just a rock formation.\n\nIf the world was ever really covered by a flood that large, there would be evidence in the rock layers around the world.

2,"Is there anything that moves faster than the speed of light?

Tachyons are hypothetical particles which travel faster than light locally.  They must have imaginary valued mass to be able to do so, but they have real valued energy and momentum.  Sometimes people imagine that such FTL particles would be impossible to detect but there is no reason to think so.  The shadows and spotlights suffice to show that there is no logic in the suggestion because they can go FTL and still be seen.\n\nNo tachyons have been definitely found and most physicists would doubt their existence.  There was a claim that experiments to measure neutrino mass in Tritium beta decay indicated that they were tachyonic.  It is very doubtful but not entirely ruled out.  Tachyon theories have problems because, apart from the possibility of causality violations, they destabilise the vacuum.  It may be possible to get round such difficulties but then we would not be able to use tachyons for the kind of FTL communication that we would like.\n\nThe truth is that most physicists consider tachyons to be a sign of pathological behaviour in field theories, and the interest in them among the wider public stems mostly from the fact that they are used so often in science fiction."

The government designed social security as a savings plan for ourselves so we have an income after retirement.  I don't want or need their help.  Plus, there probably will be virtually nothing left for me anyway, seeing as I won't be 62 for 35 years.
The crazy truth about social security is that it's not a savings plan for your future. Everything that is deducted from your paycheck now is used to make social security payments to those currently receving benefits. We are paying for the benefits of the previous generation and the next generation will be paying for ours. However, everyone agrees that this is an unsustainable model and that the program will most likely go bust in the next few decades. Although I am not a big fan of Bush, he did attempt to pass legislation that would allow people making payments into a retirement plan to forego paying social security taxes.

3,"Will you give me more info on meningitis?
I've heard the illness can deafen people and kill, but I wanna know more.  So will you give me more information on the disease?
Meningitis is an inflammation of the leptomeninges and underlying subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It can be useful to divide symptom onset into acute, subacute, and chronic categories. Unlike subacute (1-7 d) or chronic (>7 d) meningitis, which have myriad infectious and noninfectious etiologies, acute meningitis (<24 h) is almost always a bacterial infection caused by one of several organisms. Depending on age and general condition, these gravely ill patients present acutely with signs and symptoms of meningeal inflammation and systemic infection of less than 1 day's duration. Patients may decompensate quickly and require emergency care, including antimicrobial therapy, within 30 minutes of emergency department (ED) presentation. \n\nNot all bacterial meningitis is acute. Approximately 75% of patients with bacterial meningitis present subacutely. These ill patients still require urgent ED diagnosis and care. \n\nThe emergence of resistant strains has prompted changes in antibiotic protocols in some countries, including the US. Apart from dexamethasone, neuronal cell protectants still hold only future promise as adjunctive therapy. \n\nThe challenges for emergency physicians when treating meningitis are to (1) identify and treat patients with acute bacterial meningitis, (2) assess whether a central nervous system (CNS) infection is present in those with suspected subacute or chronic meningitis, and (3) identify the causative organism. Bacterial meningitis must be excluded. Emergency physicians should be aware that future therapies will be based on improved understanding of the pathogenesis of acute bacterial meningitis and may include caspase inhibitors, antioxidants, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, and metalloproteinase inhibitors, in addition to antibiotics and steroids.\n\n\nPathophysiology: A number of factors influence the development of bacterial meningitis, including virulence of the strain, host defenses, and bacteria-host interactions. \n\nBacterial seeding usually occurs by hematogenous spread. In those without an identifiable source of infection, local tissue and bloodstream invasion by bacteria colonized in the nasopharynx may be a common source. Rarely, infected contiguous structures invade via septic thrombi or osteomyelitic erosion; meningeal seeding also may occur with a direct bacterial inoculate during trauma, neurosurgery, or instrumentation. Meningitis in the newborn is transmitted vertically from colonized pathogens in the maternal intestinal or genital tract or horizontally from nursery personnel or caregivers at home. \n\nOnce in the CSF, the paucity of antibodies, complement components, and white blood cells (WBCs) allows the bacterial infection to flourish. Bacterial cell wall components initiate a cascade of complement- and cytokine-mediated events that result in at least 3 critical events: increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral edema, and presence of toxic mediators in the CSF. Replicating bacteria, increasing numbers of inflammatory cells, cytokine-induced disruptions in membrane transport, and increased vascular and membrane permeability perpetuate the infectious process and account for the characteristic changes in CSF cell count, pH, lactate, protein, and glucose. Exudates extend throughout the CSF, particularly to the basal cisterns, damaging cranial nerves (eg, cranial nerve VIII, with resultant hearing loss), obliterating CSF pathways (causing obstructive hydrocephalus), and inducing vasculitis and thrombophlebitis (causing local brain ischemia). \n\nAs intracranial pressure (ICP) continues to rise and brain edema progresses, CNS autoregulatory processes begin to fail. This pivotal event may occur when the transient increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) reverses and begins to decrease. CBF reduction correlates with the patient's decreasing alertness and changes in mental status. \n\nWithout medical interventi"

methods and sofwares for forcasting future trends of production ,consumption,population and so on.
Forecasting is neither pure art nor pure science. Its a mix.\n\nFor oil consumption, I think it depends on variables like inflation, oil price, population, tax. Seasonal effect might have to be considered as well (you might need to do 'deseasonalization'.\n\nExcel and Minitab can do simple statistical methods like weighted average, exponential smoothing, and regression. Complex analyses require advanced software like SPSS.\n\nBy the way, I recommend that you ask an expert for forcasting.

1,"whats the story of david and goliath?

(m)\n\nThe original story of David and Goliath is written in the Book of Samuel (I Samuel, 16-18). David was a young Israelite, living with his family in Bethlehem, a few miles south of Jerusalem. Goliath was a well-trained Philistine soldier who stood 9 and 3/4 feet tall. The Israelites, led by King Saul, were in a battle against the great armies of the Philistines.  \n\nGoliath yelled to Israelites, ""Choose a man from among you to come fight me. If he can kill me, then the Philistines will be your servants. If I kill him, then all of you will become servants of the Philistines."" \n\nYoung David volunteered to fight Goliath. No other soldier was willing to fight the giant. Armed with only a sling and stones, David slung a stone into the giant's forehead. The giant fell down, and David grabbed the giant's sword and killed him. \n\nThis remarkable story, in which the underdog prevails against great odds, has survived thousands of years. The story is familiar. In almost every struggle or competition (military, political, business, athletic, ...), generally one side is weaker than the other. The story is appealing. Knowing that the weaker side can become the victor gives us great hope. The story is exciting. Since the expected outcome is for the stronger side to win, it is exciting when the unexpected occurs and the weaker side prevails."

""What's up is an informal expression meaning ""what are you doing"", ""how are you"", or ""what gives."" This expression was made very popular by the cartoon Bugs Bunny who used it as early as 1940 as part of his catch phrase ""What's up, Doc"" (where each word was pronounced distinctly).\n\nWhassup (sometimes spelled Wussup or wuzzup) is also a commonly used African American Vernacular English term for what's up, and was the central theme of an advertising campaign for Anheuser-Busch owned ""Budweiser"" beer brand in the early 2000s.\n\nThe phrase is often shortened to ""sup"", and this term is commonly used as an Internet slang. It's very common when playing MMORPG to read people typing ""sup bro?"" (""What's up brother?"").\n\nAmong Mexican-American street gangs in California, including the Norteños and Sureños, the phrase ""what's up"" means ""there's going to be a fight"" when opposing rival gangs confront each other."""

Overview:\nThe Bahá'í Faith is the youngest of the world's main religions. It was founded in Iran during the mid 19th century by  Siyyid 'Ali-Muhammad (1819-1850 CE). He assumed the title Bab (""the Gate"") and prophesized the future arrival of ""One greater than Himself."" One of the Bab's followers, Mirza Husayn-'Ali-i-Nuri (1817-1892), announced that he was the Manifestation predicted by the Bab. He assumed the title Baha'u'llah (""glory of God""). His teachings on world peace, democracy, civil rights, equal rights for women, the acceptance of scientific discoveries, etc. were decades ahead of his time. \n\nBahá'ís believe in a single God who has repeatedly sent prophets into the world through whom he has revealed the ""Word of God."" Prophets include Adam, Krishna, Buddha, Yeshua of Nazareth (Jesus), Mohammed, The Bab and Baha'u'llah. \n\nThe Bahá'í faith is still looked upon by many Muslims as a breakaway sect of Islam.

I've heard that it would be impossible in the date Revalations was written in for it to have been John of the Gospels
The Revelation of Jesus Christ was written by the Apostle John in 95 A.D. \nFirst, second and Third John were written 90-95 A.D.\nThe Gospel according to John was written 85-90 A.D.\nJohn would have been approximately between 80 and 100 years old during this time."
3,"Why am I dizzy?
This is the second time in under a week I have gotten dizzy while walking anyone know why?
Dizziness happens when there is not enough blood getting to the brain. This can happen if there is a sudden drop in your blood pressure or if you are dehydrated on your walks.\n\nMany people, especially as they get older, experience lightheadedness if they inititate physical activity too quickly or suddenly get up from a lying or seated position. Lightheadedness often accompanies the flu, common cold, or allergies.\n\nYou should seek guidance from your Physican if the condition persists."
3,"How can I get out of my comfort zone and take more chances at life ?
I procrastinate a lot and feel comsumed by fear and guilt.
Give your self permission to face fear, even if it's scary.  Then forgive yourself for feeling fear and guilt if (when) it happens next time.  Old habits die hard sometimes.\n\nStart with baby steps.  Learn from mistakes.  Go back to the beginning if you need to.  You don't fail this way; you only learn.  Failure becomes a learning experience.  Success, step by step, is inevitable.   There's no rush; remember that.\n\nLove ya.\n\ndakotanroscoe"

I am incredibly skinny!  I eat very large amounts of food, and cannot gain weight.  I try exercizing, and cannot gain much muscle tone either.  How do I gain weight, with a very high metabolism?  My doctor cannot explain.
Ironically, you need to do much the same as people who want to lose weight.  You are likely short on the mineral chromium.  To GAIN weight, take a 500 mcg capsule with your breakfast and another with your dinner.  Stay active and eat lots of protein.  It will take a few weeks to start working really well, but you'll notice a difference right away in how you feel since the chromium picolinate (most absorbable kind) will even out your blood sugar levels.  It also helps to build lean muscle.  You'll be looking great in no time!"

3,"what medicine or cure for autistic persons? Any study home programs to improe them as normal?

As autism is not technically a ""disease,"" there is no medicine or cure specifically for autism. \n\nAs for your question about home programs, each person with autism is very different and has different needs, so I cannot recommend a specific program. I would suggest, however, that if the person with autism you are asking about is still in school, to be sure to contact his or her teacher(s) and make sure that what he or she is learning at school is being worked on and reinforced at home, to promote generalization of learning. \n\nHere are some recommendations for more information: \n\n""Teaching Tips for Children and Adults with Autism"" by Temple Grandin, Ph.D. - http://www.autism.org/temple/tips.html\n\nWebsite of Paula Kluth, Ph.D. - http://www.paulakluth.com/autism.html\n\n""Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew"" by Ellen Notbohm - http://www.southflorida.com/sfparenting/sfe-sfp-autism,0,6196233.story\n\nAutism Society of America - http://www.autism-society.org/ \n\n\n""Work to view my autism as a different ability rather than a disability.

3,"How are subliminal messages created?

There are many things in the world you don't notice.  If your brain didn't filter out most of the stuff, you would be way too over-stimulated.  Some advertisers have taken advantage of this.  For example, the have drawn faint pictures in print advertisement that are impossible to see, because there is so much else in the ad vying for your attention.  Or they slip an image in a frame of a commercial.  (There are 25 frames per second in most TV transmissions, so one frame is 1/25 of a second, too quick to really notice.)  Or there can be a faint sound in a sound track.  None of these things are picked up by your conscious mind, but your brain gets the signal.  You just might feel good about what you saw or heard, but you won't be able to figure out the subliminal message.\n\nOf course, all of this is against the law.  In the classic book The Hidden Persuaders, written in the 1950's, a lot of this is explained.  But there are lots of tricks and a lot of people with a lot of computers sending stuff out."
3,"Why do people say..?
Why do you say eating 300 calories or less doesnt make u lose weight?.. i know an anorexic person and she's losing weight like crazy.. she only takes 200 cals a day !
When first dieting if you go to 300 calories a day the body will be fooled into thinking it is starving and go into survival mode and will store calories. Eventually, however, this will pass and you will loose weight. Most anorexics have been eating like this for months or years. The nutritional side of this extreme dieting can result in the stopping of menstruation, cardiac arrhythmia's even dental loss. The body needs a certain amount of nutrients and fuel to function at it's best. Anorexia is a mental disorder, I hope your friend is able to recover and doesn't loose her health or even her life to this ugly process."
1,"Is there really FREE WILL for us humans? We are only genes + environment. Doesn't ONLY A GOD truly have FW?

YES YOU HAVE FREEWILL... You can ether accept or reject Jesus Christ.  The choice is yours.\n\nWhat God did...\n\nThink of it this way... Imagine you're in a courtroom again, you're guilty of many serious crimes. The judge says, ""It's a fine of $500,000, or prison."" You don't have anywhere near that amount of money, so the bailiff begins to walk you out of the courtroom when someone you don't even know appears. He runs up to the judge with a check and says, ""I've paid the fine for you."" Now that the fine has been paid, the law no longer has any hold on you. You're free -- because of the gift you were given.\n\nThis is what God did for you by sending Jesus to die on the cross in your place. So that you wouldn't have to go to Hell, God sent his only Son, Jesus, to die on the cross -- suffering the punishment that justice demands. Then He rose from the grave, forever defeating death! The Bible tells us, ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life."" (John 3:16) If you will repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus, God says he will forgive all your sins and grant you the gift of everlasting life. Just like the court case we just talked about, if you repent (that means to confess and forsake your sins) and put your trust in Jesus, then you will not have to suffer God's justice in Hell because the payment for your crimes was made by Jesus on the cross.\n\nIf you're not sure what to pray, read Psalm 51, and make it a model for your prayer. The words are not ""magical,"" what God cares about is the attitude of your heart. When you pray, it should sound something like this, ""Dear God, I repent of all my sins, such as (name them). I put my trust in Jesus Christ as Lord (to say Jesus is your Lord means you are now making Jesus the master over your life) and Savior. Forgive me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.""\n\nNow read your Bible daily, and obey what you read. God will never let you down.\n\nWhat should you read? We suggest that you start in the book named ""John,"" and then read the one named ""Romans."" Whatever you decide to read, make sure you read every day."

I know I should quit but I don't want to yet. I just want to cut down.
I tried lollipops, but you can't go around with a lollipop all day long.Gum is  probably the only other thing, be careful that whatever you choose, you don't become addicted to it, I knew a man who chose life savers to try and quit, he quit, but then he was buying life savers by the cases.\nSome courses say you should keep a journal, and write down each time you have a cigarette, that will bring awareness to how many you are having, and if you put the time down, you can get a feeling of when you smoke the most.\nGood Luck!"

2,"What does the cornea in your eye do?

its a clear protective coating over the pupil and the iris. the pupil is actually an empty space. the iris is a pigmented ring of muscle which when it contracts lets less light into the eye also known as pupillary constriction. when the iris relaxes the pupil opens up causing pupillary dialation. the more constricted the pupil the sharper your vision. but at night you need to let the maximum amount of light into the eye so the pupil dialates. the large opening causes less sharp visual acuity. the lens of the eye focuses light on to the retina behind it which is filled with rods and cones which are receptors. all the nerve cells and blood vessels converge into the optic disc and then into the optic nerve behind the eye. the optic nerves of both eyes intersect and combine signals which are sent to the occipital lobe of the brain in the back of your head. so actually you see with your brain"

1,"Why is marijuana illegal and alcohol still legal?
It seems that marijuana has less negative effects than alcohol. Why was marijuana outlawed in the U.S. and not alcohol?
Because alcohol contains only alcohol. The effects upon the brain are well known and documented. Marijuana, on the other hand, has hundreds of chemicals, each possibly interacting with the other(s) in ways not yet researched. For instance, a well-known drug test involves snipping off a bit of your hair. if you smoked pot even six months ago, traces of it remain detectible as part of the hair itself, vs. the kidneys elimination if all traces of alcohol from the body within 48 hours. Also, it is suspected that pot may alter the body's DNA, so long-term chronic effects are still unknown."

My lease expired on 10/31/06.  I have not signed a new lease as of 11/14/06.  The existing lease states that if I do not sign a new one, that the current lease automatically extends, landlord is charging me $35 for every month that I do not renew lease.(it did not say for how long, month 2 month or yearly)  Do I have to give my landlord notice that I am moving?  \nAlso, I have had problems with electrical stuff, 2 hot in summer, and bcuz of probems, cud not run AC. Now, No heat,  and landlord tells me that 5 more days for proper technician to come.  currently 55 degrees in PA.\nI am definitely moving out (end of month) but wanted to know best way to protect myself.  FYI, landlord tried to evict me last month for Aug and Sep rent being late.  I did a pay and stay agreement, paid all past due rent.  I feel like they are jerking bcuz my rent was late last 2 months, should I just leave?  or should I 'fight' cuz serious problems with 'standard of living'
He has all the legal right to charge you an extra fee for renting after a lease and not resigning a lease....this is 100% common practice in all rentals.\n\nDo you have to give notice that you are moving?  No...but then he doens't have to give you back your deposit nor does he have to give you a good referance for your next place.  After all, you stiffed him by not giving a notice in turn making him lose rent money, why would he want to be nice to you?\n\nLandlord cannot control outside contractors for work.  All he can do is put in a call to one and wait for their earliest date.  Just because they are a landlord doesn't mean a technichian will show up inside of 2 hours.  When you have issues with power, heat, etc and its either hot or cold out, you will wait extra long for help as there are many that need help right when you do.  So sit in line and wait patiently.  Since it is not below 40 degree's nor you have mentioned any kids, by law he does not have to guarantee power or heat if its out and below or above any temperatures.  Nor does he need to compensate you for hotel or any place you stay outside of your apartment when no power or no heat.  That responsibility is totally on you.  But now if you have home owners or renters insurance, then these will help pick up the tab for such issues.\n\nYour comment on him trying to evict you...if you are late....by law he has all the right to kick you out.  If you refuse, the police will remove you and charge you with tresspassing.  And by law he can toss your stuff to the curb and allow anyone to take it.\n\nYou have no fight as all you have done is either your fault or past there ability to control it.  Welcome to the real world, welcome to the world of renting and welcome to learning a few laws that have been on the books for ages.\n\nYou forget...that is their property, not yours...your are ""borrowing"" it for as long as you have paid.  If you don't pay, even for 1 day, why would they have to let you stay?  They can rent it to someone else that will pay.\n\nMove if you want, but rentals are rentals, same laws no matter where you go."
1,"Why do some people ware the instument around their neck that was used to put Jesus to death...?
Would you tie the gun around your neck that was used to put to death your dear love one?
the cross has it origins in pagan history.  The cross was not used by the early Christians but become common place after the pagans and Christians were united under Constantine.  Christ was not killed on a cross anyway.  It was a straight pole without any appendages.  let me ask you, if your best friend was killed with a knife, would you hang a knife around your neck?  And would that remind you of his death or his great life?  yes, his death.  All the pictures of Christ show him on the ""cross"" died, not the resurrected Christ.  I think it is Satan's trick used to offend God, whose son was killed indirectly by Satan's thinking that he had foiled God's plan.  Indeed we should destroy these satanic pagan symbols.  Besides, they have no effect.  I have seen a lot of criminals and drug dealers wearing them.  What's the deal with that?"

Yes, it does change as they grow from tiny chick to adult crow.  Also, the same crow changes its calls depending upon the time of year and also depending upon what the crows are ""saying"" to each other.  It can be an alert to danger, a signal to fly away, an all clear, ""I'm hungry"" from a bird not yet developed enough to care for itself fully, and there is even an ""I'm in the mood"" signal among calls.  Actually all birds have a varied vocabulary for communication, but we usually don't pay enough attention to hear them.  Good ear!"
3,"describe the structure of the respiratory?

Respiration is achieved through the mouth, nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. Oxygen enters the respiratory system through the mouth and the nose. The oxygen then passes through the larynx (where speech sounds are produced) and the trachea which is a tube that enters the chest cavity. In the chest cavity, the trachea splits into two smaller tubes called the bronchi. Each bronchus then divides again forming the bronchial tubes. The bronchial tubes lead directly into the lungs where they divide into many smaller tubes which connect to tiny sacs called alveoli. The average adult's lungs contain about 600 million of these spongy, air-filled sacs that are surrounded by capillaries. The inhaled oxygen passes into the alveoli and then diffuses through the capillaries into the arterial blood. Meanwhile, the waste-rich blood from the veins releases its carbon dioxide into the alveoli. The carbon dioxide follows the same path out of the lungs when you exhale. \n\nThe diaphragm's job is to help pump the carbon dioxide out of the lungs and pull the oxygen into the lungs. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscles that lies across the bottom of the chest cavity. As the diaphragm contracts and relaxes, breathing takes place. When the diaphragm contracts, oxygen is pulled into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, carbon dioxide is pumped out of the lungs. \n\nThese links should help."
1,"why are christians so fearful?
If christians are acually going to heaven as they say they are why are they afraid to die? also with all the advancing technology why do they try to stop it? why are they after education too? If christianity is true as the snottty twits claim why then why are they fearful of change?
Well said and Bravo. I personally do not want to die, I want to go to the afterlife, but not their heaven.

3,"Has anyone here been bullied before? And if so, does it still affect your daily life?
I was bullied at school for 5 years, and I'm finding it hard to move on. I'm sensitive by nature anyway but bullying hasn't helped my self-esteem or confidence at all. I'm 18, was bullied between ages 9-14.
i reckon that everyone has been bullied at least once in their life. i use to get bullied all the time when i was in grade prep to 4 for being asian. i was the only one being bullied because of my background. they use to do all sorts of ugly things to me. i was even dacked at one point. they woulds teal my money but rubbish in my bag and call my nasty names. they would even try to get me into trouble and the teacher believes them and did nothing to help me. it all stopped when i was in grade 5 and i somehow became popular. back then i use to hate myself fro bveing asian but then i realized that hey, im not the one complaining and bitching about being asian. i use to hate life so much i  wanted to die, but its part of growing up and its just somethig that you experience to learn more about life. oh yeah u answered my question about the paris hilton perfume, where did you read the info about the chemicas that attract the opposite sex? sorry this is the only way for me to contact you/"
7,"HOW CAN I FIX MY CREDIT,AND HOW DO I GET STUFF OFF OF IT THAT HAS BEEN CLEARED UP?

Is your poor credit score the result of your own true actions (i.e. have you paid late, defaulted, or taken on too much credit)? If this is the case then, unfortunately, there isn't really much you can do to improve your score. If this is not the case and your poor credit score is the result of fraudulent activity under your name then you do have recourse. Firstly, you will want to report the abuse to all the credit reporting agencies, the credit issuers, and the authorities. Once you have done this, you can consult with the respective credit reporting agencies to help clear your unwarrented bad record.\n\nNow, if your score is because of your own actions the best thing going for you is time. The older your bad stuff is on your report the better this will be for you. Therefore, don't continue to make bad decisions when using credit. Also, to reestablish a good credit score you may want to take out a secured lined of credit. This can be done many ways but one easy way is that you deposit money with an issuing credit card company. I did this years ago with Citibank sending them $300 in which I got a credit card with a $300 limit. After a year of using my card wisely, paying my bill every month on time, they sent me a new credit card with an $1800 limit and my $300 back with interest. This was 12 years ago now and I just got out of high school at the time so $300 isn't what it used to be but whatever amount you start with it will start improving your credit. Good luck."
7,"how a tupe tv work?

You mean TUBE TV?\n\nAlmost all TVs in use today rely on a device known as the cathode ray tube, or CRT, to display their images. LCDs and plasma displays are sometimes seen, but they are still rare when compared to CRTs. It is even possible to make a television screen out of thousands of ordinary 60-watt light bulbs! You may have seen something like this at an outdoor event like a football game. Let's start with the CRT, however, because CRTs are the most common way of displaying images today. \n\nThe terms anode and cathode are used in electronics as synonyms for positive and negative terminals. For example, you could refer to the positive terminal of a battery as the anode and the negative terminal as the cathode. \n\nIn a cathode ray tube, the ""cathode"" is a heated filament (not unlike the filament in a normal light bulb). The heated filament is in a vacuum created inside a glass ""tube."" The ""ray"" is a stream of electrons that naturally pour off a heated cathode into the vacuum. \n\nElectrons are negative. The anode is positive, so it attracts the electrons pouring off the cathode. In a TV's cathode ray tube, the stream of electrons is focused by a focusing anode into a tight beam and then accelerated by an accelerating anode. This tight, high-speed beam of electrons flies through the vacuum in the tube and hits the flat screen at the other end of the tube. This screen is coated with phosphor, which glows when struck by the beam."

7,"Why would a transaction disappear from the history on my bank account?
Yesterday I used an ATM twice.  I checked my online banking page last night and both of the transactions appeared and were reflected in my balance.  Now I just checked my online banking page again and those two transactions have completely disappeared and my balance is bigger... as though the withdrawals never happened.\n\nWhy is this?  This has never happened to me before.  I'm not gonna call my bank and ask them... just in case I actually got that lucky.  But I'm sure not counting my chickens because this seems really strange.\n\nCan anyone explain this to me?
Because the bank memo posts all transactions.  That is why you saw your transactions at first but they went away.  They will definitely come back--you can bet on it.  What is happening is the bank is waiting for the merchant to send through the complete transaction slip to debit your account  That can take anywhere from one day to six months....depending on the merchant.  Do not take the funds out.  Always go by the balance in your checkbook...it is the most accurate you can have."
1,"who do u think is more violentblacks or white?
Before you answer think about this \nThe federal government’s own crime statistics reveal that 90 percent of all violent interracial crimes are committed by blacks on Whites, not the reverse. Given that blacks only constitute about 13 percent of the population, a black person is 50 times more likely than a White person to commit a violent interracial crime.\nAlso:\nat last count the ADL was moaning about the fact that since Skinheads emerged in the U.S. there have been almost 2 dozen Skinhead-related homicides in the country. ALMOST two dozen! (And they are even counting the times when a WP Skinhead is the one killed.)\nAlmost two dozen in almost three decades. Statistically speaking, that makes bumblebees 10 times deadlier than White Power Skinheads. even Sunday school bus drivers kill more people a year than Skinheads.
Blacks, without a question."
2,"What exactly is a black hole?

A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond, thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.\n\nWhat happens is large masses collapse under their own weight. Think of a house of cards. The more you pile on, the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom can't take the weight anymore. When the house of cards falls, the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.\n\nNow instead of a house of cards, replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside. The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually, like the house of cards, it falls down. Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it's onw gravity, and not down like earth gravity, the sun doesn't fall down, it falls IN.\n\nWhen this does happen the gravity doesn't stop existing because the matter doesn't either, it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it's core. Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons, or light particles, the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.\n\nThere ya have it!"

2,"Why does the depths of the skies and the seas look blue? Why do rivers not look blue from a height?

To answer this question, you should know that the white light is made up of seven different colors (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red). When sunlight (which is white colored) hits the Earth's atmosphere the blue components of the white light bend so much that it seems like they surround the Earth causing the sky to look blue. \nThe seas llok blue because they act like a mirror and they reflect the sky. The sea color is darker than the sky because of the depth of the seas (Beer-Lambert's Law). The rivers are not suppose to be deep and that's why they don't appear blue. If human eyes were really strong then we could have seen that the rivers are slightly blue."
1,"Where are all of the Apostles for today?
Does anyone know why we don't hear anything about or see any true modern day Apostles?
The Catholic Church also has the ""same pattern"" of bishop (episkopos in the Greek original), priest (presbyteros), and deacon (diaconos.) What distinguishes us is apostolic succession: a Catholic or East Orthodox priest can show how the line of ordinations in his history takes him right back to the laying on of hands of one of the apostles.\n\nHowever, I'm not going to argue that this is what makes an apostle. What makes someone an apostle is when every facet of his or her life is a response to that simple challenge issued to the original apostles: ""Follow me."""

We are needing investors to help get our company off the ground. We would like to specialize in construction of new furniture with reclaimed or salvaged wood which helps the environment. If we had the right equipment to haul and cut lumber taken down from commerical property we would have more than enough wood to build furinture. These trees are usually cut and burnt or shredded, what a waste of good timber. We would also like to know where we might find federal grants for such a business.
It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

as in ""you're just a young punk!""
Punk is a subculture, alternative culture, counterculture, and youth culture based on a shared set of cultural elements distinct from those of popular culture and other subcultures. Punk has its own distinct music, ideology, fashion, visual art, dance, literature and film. An otherwise disparate assortment of mostly young people, members of the subculture, or punks, express these cultural elements in the context of punk communities, or scenes. Punk has a long and complicated history. Since emerging in the United Kingdom and the United States in the mid-1970s, punk has spread across the globe and undergone a series of tumultuous developments. Punk is made up of an assortment of smaller subcultures, each distinguished by its own specific articulation of the cultural elements of punk. Several subcultures developed out of punk to become distinct in their own right, including goth, grunge and emo. Punk has unique relationships with other subcultures and popular culture as a whole."

1,"What is the link between the Knights Templar and Modern Freemasonry?

The first ""connection"" was made by an incredible dude, Chevalier Ramsey. Chevalier Ramsey was an extraordinary figure of his day (born about 1680). A man with a great literary reputation, he was a tutor to royalty and ostensibly a Freemason although the details of his membership are somewhat obscure. \n\nIn 1737, Ramsay, identified as 'Grand Orator' (although there was no such position in that Grand Lodge at that time), delivered a discourse before the Grand Lodge of France in which he set forth his theory in explicit terms.\n\nCoil's Masonic Encyclopedia says this: ""Rejecting all references to the Traveling Architects from Como, to the Stone Masons of Germany, and the Operative Freemasons of England, he had sought a noble and chivalric origin for Freemasonry, which with him was not a confraternity founded on a system of architecture, but solely on the military prowess and religious enthusiasm of knighthood."" Other writers, both Masons and non, have continued to attempt to make the same connection through this very day. It is one, however, with no provable basis, save conjecture."" \n\nCoil's Masonic Encyclopedia also adds, ""This theory of Templar origin which, mythical as it is and wholly unsubstantiated by the authority of history, has exercised a vast influence in the fabrication of advanced Degrees and the invention of Continental Rites.""\n\nJohn J. Robinson wrote a very wildly speculative book called _Born in Blood_ which ties the surviving Knights Templar to what became Freemasons up in Scotland. Robinson was not a Mason when he wrote the book but BECAME ONE because of what he discovered. \n\nPersonally, I like the link. No one ever found the Templar fleet after Philip ""the Fair"" and his lap-dog Pope, Clement, arrested, tortured and killed the Templars. Lots of riches went away, too.\n\nNow, anybody want to talk about the Shroud of Turin and its image? Jacques de Molay??? Hmmmm. *grin*\n\nJust a simple Master Mason from a Co-Masonic Lodge"

1,"When was Jesus Christ really born?
December 25 is not his real birthday. According to reliable encyclopedias this date was just chosen as a politcal move by an emperor and a pope. Sort of Christianize pagans.\n\nThe bible is also silent. It says that when he was born shepherds were out in the fields. This could not happen in December coz that month is winter and raining in Bethlehem.\n\nSo, when?
If you were to read this account to the average Israeli today and ask him what time of year this could be, he would likely answer, “Sometime between April and October.” Why? The answer is simple. From November to March is the cold, rainy season in Israel, and December 25 is certainly in the wintertime. Shepherds would not be living out-of-doors, keeping watch over their flocks in the fields at night. Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, is located in the higher elevations and is just a few miles from Jerusalem. Even in years when the weather is less extreme, it is quite cold there at night during the winter.—Micah 5:2; Luke 2:15.\nA look into history at the time of Jesus’ birth sheds light on the fact that he was not born during December’s snow. Jesus’ mother, Mary, although in an advanced stage of pregnancy, had to travel from her home in Nazareth to Bethlehem. She and Joseph did so to meet the requirements of the census decreed by the Roman ruler Caesar Augustus. (Luke 2:1-7) The Jewish populace, resenting the Roman rule and its heavy taxation, was already on the verge of rebellion. Why would Rome unnecessarily irritate them by requiring many to travel to be registered during the most difficult and even treacherous winter weather? Is it not far more reasonable that this would have been decreed for a season that lends itself to travel, such as spring or autumn?\n\nRECORDED EVIDENCE OF COLD WINTERS\nEzra 10:9 reports that it can get cold during the winter months as recorded in the scripture:\n""  So all the men of Judah and Benjamin collected themselves together at Jerusalem within three days, that is, in the ninth month on the twentieth [day] of the month, and all the people kept sitting in the open place of the house of the [true] God, shivering because of the matter and on account of the showers of rain.  ""\nDecember corresponds to the latter part of the ninth month (Chislev) of the ancient Hebrew calendar and the early part of the tenth month (Tebeth). With this in mind, consider the account in Ezra 10:9 about something that happened just a few miles from Bethlehem:\n\nTRUTH\nAs for December the 25th being designated as Christ's birthday, substituting of factual evidence with something known as a falsehood shows disregard for the wholesome truth at the very least. What other truths could be substituted also for falsehoods."

1,"Biblical Name for 4 but not 1?
I'm not ready to have kids any time soon or anything, but I was thinking about this after I read an email my friend sent me.\n\nI really like the name Chiara and plan to name my first daughter that. But all the other names I like and plan to name my kids are Biblical names such as Joshua and Gabriel for boys and Bethany and Jordan for girls.\n\nDo you think it'd be weird one daughter not to have a Biblical name when all her siblings do? I just had it on my mind and was wondering what other people thought. I still have a long time to go...\n\nJust no stupid answers please....
No it's not stupid at all. I mean you are the parent, it's your child, and you can name your child anything you want, you came your child after a fruit if you want, and if no one likes it oh well,. when I have kids for a girl Nevaeh (which is Heaven spelled backwards) and For a boy Zion.

7,"When selling a house is lease to purchase a good deal?

Yes..Because by doing a lease purchase..You can have them pay you $3,000-$5,000 down..Plus rent I'm sure you'll be charging them a couple extra hundreds to what the mortgage payment is..Residual income. And you win again because they are paying down the amount you owe on the house.  And they're putting equity into your home. \n Once they have been in the house, paid on time..About a year or two. Depending how you structure the contract, give them time enough to build their credit. Again, you can structure the deal.. the contract by specifying they have 12-18 months to get their credit together..to get their own loan in their name..If not..start the process over. \n They've paid so much toward paying off your house..And you get so much extra cash..It's a good investment. If that's the way you chose to go.\nJust adding something else. To what the lawyer said..Even if they  get behind on payments or make late payment..It's still your responsibility as the owner (loan holder) to make sure they pay..If not, you are responsible for making sure they pay..To avoid foreclosure..After all, the house is still in your name. It's best you hold onto the down payment they pay you..In case they are late on paying the mortgage note or skip out on you. You'll have the money sat aside to make the payments until you find someone else to put in the house...\n\nYes you can do the lease purchase for investment or if the house has been on the market too long.."

3,"I want to take diet pills, do they have any harmful side effects?
I am below 18
diet pills, even if they say they are all natural, are not ""natural"" for your body.  effects of diet pills ranges from diarrhea, dehydration, headaches, feeling of dryness in the mouth and eyes, and in worst cases, poisoning.  there are diet pills that are supposed to aid in metabolism, and are supposed to suppress your hunger, but different people have different body chemistry, therefore the pills have different effects on people.\n\nif you do want to aid your weightloss, consult a doctor.  not only can they help you in choosing a diet pill with low side effects, they can even test you on some ingredients of diet pills so as to know whether or not your body will accept or reject them.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE DIET PILLS WITHOUT MEDICAL CONSULTATION.  even OTC drugs have side effects.\n\nthe best way to lose weight is for you to incorporate a well balanced diet and good, regular exercise in your daily life.  a low fat, low carb, high fibre diet is good for almost everyone; and jogging, biking, swimming, even walking to the bus station and doing chores around the house is good exercise.  not only will this aid in your weightloss, it is very easy to maintain and incorporate in your daily activities."

2,"What are the basics for a earthquake prone building?
This is for a stupid science project where we build a building out of spag. noodles and glue and it is tested on an earthquake simulator. thanks for your help.!!!
Here's an answer that comes from a class I took in structural engineering.  Every building has a natural resonant frequency, ie, a frequency that it tends to oscillate at if it's shaken.  It's just like a tuning fork, or the string of a violin.  If an earthquake shakes the structure at a rate equal to its resonance, it will vibrate much more intensely, and be subject to more damage, that would be the case if the frequency were different. Also, I should point out, there are higher frequencies, called harmonics, which have a similar effect; however, they're not nearly as bad, and can often be ignored.  It has been determined from experience that the very worst earthquakes tend to produce vibrations in the 2 to 4 Hz range, so the engineer designs a building so its natural resonant frequency falls outside this range.  So here's a tip: Find out what frequency the earthquake simulator produces.  Try to design your building so its resonate freq. is higher or lower than that.  You'll have to think a bit about this, and be ingenious!  The frequency can be calculated, but that involves solving some differential equations (I don't think you're ready for that, yet...)"

2,"Have a single phase sychronous motor that is turning both ways?
Normal operation would be for it to turn only one direction. Anyone know where I can find answers for what the possible problems could be.
the chances are that if the motor has only one capacitor ( capacitor run only) then the run capacitor is faulty and if the motor happens to be spinning in one direction it will get up to speed in that direction. Answer buy a new capacitor. if the motor has two capacitors (capacitor start/run) the chances are the motor has serious problems because the rotation of the motor is dependent on the the terminal connections."

3,"What causes bone spurs & WHAT can I do about them??
I am troubled by a bone spur in my left heel.  I had no such trouble until shortly after I went through chemo.  I blame the chemo for breaking down my body & thus somehow causing the bone spur.\n\nDoes anyone know the cause, & are there any home remedies for this?  Sometimes it just aches & feels like I'm walking on a pebble all the time!\nThanks!
You should check with your doctor on any of this.  I found the below information on www.mayoclinic.com\n\nBone spurs, also called osteophytes, are bony projections that grow along the edges of joints. The bone spurs themselves aren't painful. But they can rub against nearby nerves and bones and cause pain.\n\nBone spurs are often associated with osteoarthritis. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage of an affected joint is worn down and eventually you may have bone rubbing on bone, resulting in pain and inflammation. Your body may try to repair this damage by growing new bone (bone spurs) along the existing bone. This produces prominent lumps, usually on the hands, feet or spine.\n\nThere's no specific treatment for bone spurs. Treatment is typically directed at the underlying problem to prevent further joint damage."

Sorry to say that you may just be stressing out because YOU want to be Pregnant. More than likely you will probably get your period.

1,"what are 5 things you wish other people new about your religion?
let's face it when it comes to other people religions 90% of us are ignorant. so i'm interested to find out what sort of things we don't know about each others religion.\nplease no hateful comments or statements such as ""this is the true religion"" ""other religion is false"" etc. \nyou don't have to write 5 things, but give it a go.
1.That not every single Muslim woman who wears the hijab is subservient to men. Sure there are Muslim men who twist the words of God to fit their evil thinking, but that's in all religions. So why should I be the poster child for how bad/backward/silly/claustrophobic others think Islam and the hijab are?\n\n2. Muslims are not commanded to hate and kill the so-called infidels! I'm so sick and tired of hearing that bs. I mean if that's the truth then I would have to hate my mother and her family! \nCome on people! Read the Qu'ran with open eyes and hearts. Chapter 109: The Disbelievers\n1.Say: O! Disbelievers!\n2. I worship not that which you worship,\n3. Nor will you worship that which I worship.\n4. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping.\n5. Nor will you worship that which I worship.\n6. To you be your religion, and to me my religion.\n\n3. Reading a translation of the Qu'ran is not the same as reading the Qu'ran in Arabic. Arabic is a hard language to translate and the Qu'ran is even harder. I mean even Arabs have a hard time with it. There are words in it that no one knows the meanings to except God. \nSo how can anyone who's read the abriged and translated version claim to have any understanding what's so ever? Qu'ranic scholars study for years to really understand it and even a lay-person such as myself will tell you that every single time i read it I pick up a new meaning. That's the eternal message and beauty of it- a new meaning each time; a new solution to a problem you didn't know you faced.\n\n4. A tafsir or an explanation of the Qu'ran would come in great for anyone who's reading the Qu'ran and just wants to go deeper. A tafsir explains each of the 6000+ verses in detail. It explains the hows, whens, whys, and wheres of each verse. \nAdditionally it not only includes Muslim explanations of the verses, but Jewish as well. (Especially concerning Moses (PBUH)).\n\n5. When I discuss Islam's message with people, they always tell me how my God doesn't have mercy or grace or any other characteristic attributable to a 'good god'. Instead He's all about violence and punishment and retribution. \nI wish those people read the 99 names of God. According to Muslim tradition God has given himself 99 names that are indictive of his characteristics and attributes. Trust me when I say, Muslims cry when hearing His names. I wish people could know them; then they'd know."
7,"What happens when I file for bankruptcy?
I just received a letter of foreclosure on my house. I'm not going to be able to come up with the amount of money needed in the time allotted to stop it. So I'm considering filing for bankruptcy. If I do this, will they take my house anyway? I understand there are several different types of bankruptcy. I'm not trying to get out of my debt completely *unless that's an option* so I don't know if this effects whether we could keep our house or not. I need to know because if they are going to take it anyway, then I'd need to decide whether it's better to have a foreclosure or bankruptcy on my credit.
I think it would be best to talk to a lawyer in your state as the laws vary...I am so sorry that this is happening to you.\n It is a horrible feeling as I too am in the same boat as you."

You need to go to a doctor.  Your problem could be mental or physical.  I don't mean to be rude, but it seems that if your boyfriend respected you, he wouldn't want to hurt you.  He should want to help you get help and be there for you.  I read that the way your partner makes you feel can result in painful sex.  That aside, it could also be an infection, urinary tract problems, abnormalities of the uterus or ovaries, or a condition called vaginismus.  I hope this helps."

1,"i'm visiting rehoboth beach and would like to know where the gay life style hang out?

Rehoboth is located about 30 minutes north of Ocean City in Sussex County along the Southern Delaware coastline -- the scenic drive through Fenwick Island and Bethany and Dewey beaches is enough to make the trip worthwhile. The town is probably best known as a ""gay beach."" This is evident in the rainbow-colored triangle stickers and flags in the windows of many area businesses and the smattering of same-sex couples holding hands on the boardwalk. This contemporary celebration of the gay community and lifestyle is intriguing given Rehoboth's conservative origins."

1,"Is The World Good?
The Bible states that when God had made his creation, that he viewed it and stated it was GOOD. I am having great diificulty fitting in the existing World Order to this statement: even set aside humans with free will, and look at the rest of this world's creation which is a predatory system where everything is on something else's food chain. Surely a loving God of supreme intelligence could have come up with a better system? I hope Deepak Chopra sees this.....
It was good, but we screwed it up. It wasn't always a predatory system, and all the other problems in the world didn't exist when God created it. They came about after we sinned, after the fall of humankind. Since then, death has reigned suppreme, and it has been the fate of people and animals to die, and to compete with each other for limited resources in a corrupt world. It was good, but it's been spoiled. But Jesus promised that He would restore it when He returnes; it WILL be GOOD again!!\nBy the way- just so someone reading this doesn't get the wrong idea, the predatory system in nature (eating meat) isn't wrong, it just wasn't the original way things worked. God allowed it after the fall, I believe, to help us survive in a less than ideal world."

I was sad to see all the hateful and negative comments you got on this question earlier. Maybe you hit a nerve. Yes, God wants us to pray for unbelievers and believers, anyone who the Spirit puts on our hearts to pray for. It is His will that we do this. If we ask anything according to His will...

All we are called to do in bringing someone to the understanding of who Christ is, is to be is who we are and share our testimony of who He is to us.\n\nFaith is the assurance of hope. Only they can keep or strenghten their faith. We can not do this for them. We can share our faith, and what God has said of it. Share the chapters listed below in the book of Hebrews. Thank God for using you in this way. Give Him the praise and the glory, for it is by His grace and mercy alone that He will touch their hearts, just as He touched yours. May God bless and encourage you, as you share His love and your own love for others."
1,"Do you think Islam is a religion of peace?
Many terrorists praise Allah when they complete their dastardly deeds.  Muslim Clerics declare jihad in the Mosques they preach from.  Mohammed caracatures sparked riots all over the middleeast and europe.  We are told these are the radicals, but is that really true.  Doesnt it seem to be a zillion radical extremists?
Islam isn't a religion of peace.  It is a religion of pieces ... \n\n... as in, that's what they would like to have everyone who doesn't agree with them chopped into.\n\nMuslims riot in the streets by the thousands to protest cartoons of Mohamed.  On the other hand, when someone tries to arrange a peaceful march by ""moderate"" Muslims to protest the suicide bombings and beheading of civilians, it is lucky to get more than a few dozen participants."
3,"Why is it so hard to get over the hurt from your parents in childhood?
As you grow older, you realize and understand why your parents did what they did to you. For the most part, they did not mean what they did or said. Damage is done. No reason to get angry now. However, even knowing the fact it's over with, it still angers you and it extends from you to others. Can hurtful feeling overcomes reasoning? Is there something I can do?
Just know that you are special and it is not your fault what they said or did. Know that God is with you and always has been, and focus on just being the best person that you can be. Be successful, and be greatful for life, also know that your parents probably didn't know any better, and forgive them, to make yourself be even better. Know that you overcame that, and can think about it and rationalize it, and get past it, knowing you are a really good person inside, who wants a good happy life. \n\nAnd when it does feel like it hurts realy bad, just thank God that he was there to help you through it and for the ability to now think positively and rationalize why you are such a good person who deserves so much. And know that you will be happy in the future and will make a positive difference in making people feel good, especially when you ever have kids, so that you can be everything to them that you never had.\nBasically:\nJust have HOPE and keep FAITH."

3,"what's the better way to get rid of pimples?
like when you have so many pimples on your back,forehead,chest
I highly recommend the OBAGI chemical peels. You can only get the Obagi peels at the dermatologist's office.  The peels performed by the dermatologist will leave some redness and flaking - but it's not a big deal - it feels like a sunburn.  The more peels you get and the stronger they are - the less likely you'll get a recurrence of acne.  Afterwards you follow a maintenance routine at home and it's all good.  \n\nI also recommend the Glycolic peels from A-CUTE DERM. You can order those online, no prescription necessary.  Choose the lowest grade of peeling action to start and always use a sunscreen when going outside (peels make you more prone to sunburn).\n\nSomeone here suggested going to an acupuncturist - I would recommend this also."
1,"Who's most likely to live in fear?  christians(who think the devil exist) or atheists(who don't believe?

I was a Christian for many years. I feared many things... death, evil, Hell, God, ""backsliding"".... all sorts of things.\n\nI am now an atheist and do not believe in ANYTHING supernatural, so by default Hell, gods, demons, etc. hold zero fear for me. Also, I do not think it will be any different for me after I die than it was for me all those years before I was born, and while I do try to avoid death, I do not fear it. I accept it as part of life. If you listen to what Christians pray for, it's pretty obvious they fear a lot more than the wrath of their own god.\n\nAlso, I no longer have Satan or God to blame for my actions in any way. Taking full responsibility for what you do brings self-confidence, and self-confidence is a great way to get rid of fear. When you think you can pray and some powerful buddy will bail you out of trouble, you aren't showing much self-reliance. Not feeling like you can do anything on your own against ultra-powerful entities should make it obvious to the Christians themselves that they naturally have more fear than atheists.\n\nI know many  Christians who use the argument that if I am wrong and there is a god, I will go to Hell. So if they use fear to recruit new Christians and keep them, doesn't it stand to reason they would have more fear?\n\nAdded after reading other responses: Almost every answer from Christians so far shows a fear I overcame... the fear of not being Christian! LOL!"

3,"Riding to lose weight?
Does riding the excercise bik help you to lose weight or gain muscle in your legs? i want to tone my legs and lose a little fat but i dont want to put on muscle. is there a way i should be sitting on the bike? or should i stand on the peddles?
Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)"

I worry more about mass extinction events like an asteroid impact or finding out that giant aliens have just been raising humanity as a food source to harvest en masse. Bird flu might do a job on us or some alien organism brought back by space exploration which our bodies are unable to manufacture antibodies. Maybe global nuclear conflict will leave the earth a smoking glow-in-the-dark beacon rotating and wobbling in the solar system.

7,"How can I tell if a co-op building is in good financial shape?
I am reviewing a co-op apartment building's financial statements and it gets really confusing.  The management office says they report losses or deficits because they operate as a not-for-profit entity.  They refinanced their 2 balloon mortgages with high interest (7.7% rate) into a smaller interest (5.8%) fixed-rate mortgage but from $10 mil to $15 mil amounts to capitalize and fund renovations (i.e. window replacement for entire building in 2005 $1.5 mil) and boosted the reserve funds to over $2 million.  But this is done at the cost of putting the building and the co-op shareholders into more deficit.  Is it smart financing, or irresponsible fiscal management?  The building is a luxury apt and looks well maintained with nearly 100% owner occupancy.  Should I be worried or glad?

3,"Please help---period question....really really confused?
How common is it to take 5 over the counter pregnancy tests and they all turn out negative? I had a really light period last month---Im on the pill and it was brown discharge for only a couple hours.That was my complete period. t's NEVER been that light in 8 years that I have had my period. I took the test before my period, after the light period, and then 19 days after I had sex with my boyfriend. Would I know if Im pregnant by now and took all those tests?? I spaced the tests over about 3 or 4 days too but heard that the otc tests don't work. \n\nI had my wisdom teeth out last month, thats why Im freaking out because they had me on all these meds and put me under for it, and I had sex the weekend before I did that and heard sperm can live in your for 7 days. They had me on 3 antibiotics too, but I still took my birth control like usual \n\nWhat do I do if this month I skip my period or its really really light? Im so worried Im overeating and really stressed thinking about my peroid
Normally, once you take a pregnancy test, it is recommended that you report to your doctor to confirm the results. Although OTC pregnancy test are ""kinda"" accurate, the only way to truly determine pregnancy, is via laboratory test known as Ascheim-Zondek (A-Z test). (see also pregnancy tests that check urine and those that test blood)\n\nNevertheless, the benefit of birth control pill is not only 99.8% effective in preventing pregnancy, but they also help to make shorter, lighter periods, along with regulating periods. This accounts for the brown discharge and lighter periods - with some up-to-date hormonal birth control, periods only come once every three (3) months.\n\nSo I don't believe you should have to worry about a misscarriage from the meds you were prescribed from your wisdom tooth, including the antibiotics. There has never been a report of becomming pregnant when ""the pill"" is used correctly.\n\nAlthough you did not confirm the results of the pregnancy test with your doctor, you can count on the results of the five (5) OTC pregnancy tests to be accurate.  Within 2-3 months, you  body should adjust to the pill, your period should become normal, but if not, consult with your doctor.\n\nHope this answers your question!"

2,"plz tell me about a    water scorpion?

Nepidae is a family of insects in the order Hemiptera, suborder Heteroptera. Sometimes it is placed in the infraorder Nepomorpha.[1] They are commonly called water scorpions for their superficial resemblance to a scorpion, which is due to the modification of the legs of the anterior pair for prehension, and to the presence of a long slender process, simulating a tail, at the posterior end of the abdomen. There are two genera in the family, Nepa and Ranatra. Members of the Ranatra are sometimes called needle bugs or water stick insects as they are more slender than Nepa. The common British species (Nepa cinerea) lives in ponds and stagnant water, and feeds upon aquatic animal organisms principally of the insect kind. Respiration in the adult is effected by means of the caudal process, which consists of a pair of half-tubes capable of being locked together to form a siphon by means of which air is conducted to the tracheae at the apex of the abdomen when the tip of the tube is thrust above the surface of the water. In immature forms the siphon is undeveloped and breathing takes place through six pairs of abdominal spiracles. The eggs, laid in the stems of plants, are supplied with seven filamentous processes which float freely in the water.\n\nIn Nepa the body is broad and flat; but in an allied water-bug, Ranatra, which contains a single British species (R. linearis), it is long and narrow, while the legs are very slender and elongate. Certain members of this group, sometimes erroneously referred to the Nepidae, but really forming a separate family, Belostomatidae (giant water bugs), are of large size, a South American species, Belostoma grande, reaching a length of between 4 and 5 in."

Yes, it depends on how long ago, but if you have other good factors (good rental payment history never paid more than 30 days late) & good payment history on your credit you should be able to get a home loan. Depending on your job stability, income, etc. also will play a role.  Depending on how the whole credit history looks you may still be able to get a zero down mortgage, or worst case may need to put a down payment.  Also, if your credit is better try to do it in just your name, if you dont make enough income perhaps you can do a no-qualifing loan."

1,"so I'm a christian and lovin it, but i have always wondered about things that I think i shouldn't....?
so about like magic, i dont know whether to call it dark arts or what but like spells and things like love spells, spells to hurt other people, spells to do thing that u want to happen, i was always curious, but i just dont know and i was wondering if someone could help me and if u dont mind help me to understand a few spells and things it suppose to be ""taboo"" in a sense but im curious and I want to know i want to put a spell on someone i think its cool but well no buts im open................
ok here's the low-down. spells that help people or dont do harm are usually in the white magic catagory. spells that harm people or are done with the intention of doing someone wrong are in the dark magic. black magic is that sort of thing that uses blood and is in the realm of Satanic worship/magic. this is part personal experience (not the satanic stuff...) and part listening to others. that pretty much covers the magic except that in the wiccan world  ""love spells/potions"" are illegal and those that make them are looked down on. as for the BIBLE's take on magic... it is the work of the devil is not accurate. ""witchcraft"" (in the biblical sense) is the work of the devil because it came from the main power other than God. this would be the Devil. so anyways God's work can be done by anyone. this means that what looks to be magic, say healing the lame (i mean the kind who cant walk, sheesh people!!) can actually be from someone other than the devil. still it's not good to get into that kind thing so i hope i have satisfied your curiosity enough that you do not need to delve deeper into that world. if you have any other questions send me a messege telling me about it so i can try and help and maybe even get some points in the process. *yay points!!* \nBryan"

My father goes to Church of Religious Science. I think my sister is agnostic, not into anything. I had a Buddhist friend before. I know a guy online who is Wiccan. I have a new friend now who is Sikh but he cuts his hair off. I knew a Lakota shaman during college. I've known several people who practiced Native American spirituality. Now that I am a practicing Hindu, I am making more and more new friends of the same faith. I have also known several atheists as well.\n\nWhat a diverse world we all live in!? Now if everybody could just simple Love each one of us as One Family under one God/Creator!"

1,"How do you define the thin partition between ethnic pride and ethnocentrism?
It is one thing to be proud of one's heritage, and another thing to shun and disdain the heritage of another man's race. But there is so much gray space, so many cultural and social boundaries and standards that the difference is rarely ever defined and certainly never pointed out if it is seen. Has ethnic sensitivity on all ends of the spectrum blinded us to eccentric individuals who use their ancestral histories and their heritage either as an excuse to avoid their mistakes and flaws as an individual, or as a tool to push away and shun all those who aren't their own race because of thier own personal prejudice while they pretend to fight for equality and/or righteousness? Or has political correctness just numbed us to these social injustices? How do u differentiate between pride and double standards? And why is everyone afraid to point it out? And if you are not, how do you go about doing it, and what is your response to those that attempt to reprimand and chastise you for doing so?
see how u view it. good part about ethnocentrism is that it creates a line between your culture and the other, in some part, it means retaining ur own culture without giving a chance of other culture from penetrating into ur culture. it creates a culture identity. the bad part bout ethno. is that it leads to bad consequences. you view other culture as a more inferior culture, and sum may consider it as a threat. how to resolve? by practicing culture relativism. view other culture in their own shoes. \n\nethnic pride makes us vary from each other. ethnocentrism is a sub of ethnic pride (I think)."

2,"What is cracking and knocking of fuels?

In petroleum geology and chemistry, cracking is the process whereby complex organic molecules (e.g. kerogens or heavy hydrocarbons) are converted to simpler molecules (e.g. light hydrocarbons) by the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds in the precursors. The rate of cracking and the end products are strongly dependent on the temperature and presence of any catalysts.\n\nKnocking (also called pinking or pinging)—technically detonation—in internal combustion engines occurs when fuel/air mixture in the cylinder has been ignited by the spark plug and the smooth burning is interrupted by the unburned mixture in the combustion chamber exploding before the flame front can reach it. Combusting stops suddenly, because of the explosion, before the optimum moment of the four-stroke cycle. The resulting shockwave reverberates in the combustion chamber and pressures increase catastrophically, creating a characteristic metallic ""pinging"" sound."

1,"I have some questions for anyone who knows much about Christianity & the bible?
If a girl or woman is raped & becomes pregnant does God expect that she go through w/ the pregnancy?\nIf a person smokes cigarettes or does any other physically harmful thing to themselves is it considered suicide when they die as a result?\nDoes the quote ""spare the rod; spoil the child"" mean that children should be physically punished/disciplined?\nIs the death penalty right in God's eyes? ( ""eye for an eye""), or, is it considered murderous & hypocritical?
Very good questions.  Unfortunately, there is not clear cut answer.  It depends on the heart of the person.  So, on your first question, does rape constitute abortion...no it doesn't.  However, only He knows the situation of the girl, there may be good reasons for it...we cannot judge.  \nThe second question, if a person smokes etc...is it suicide.  No it isn't, and yes it can be.  If they know better, keep doing it and just don't care, then yes it may be considered suicide, however, if they don't know any better...(think of all those kids in Asia and no one teaches them any better...that can go for a lot of other countries as well) they have no knowledge that what they are doing is harmful to themselves.\nSpare the rod, spoil the child, is not gospel.  It does not mean we should physically punish our children, but it does mean we need to discipline them.\nDeath penalty is a tough one.  Eye for an eye is the law of Moses.  Christ taught a higher law on the sermon on the mount.  However, there is something wrong with the idea of a killer sitting in prison living off the tax money of others...I do believe in the death penalty in certain cases, but it really is hard to judge.  Good thing in the end, we won't have to...God will know our hearts and judge us accordingly."

2,"How to prevent people living in houses with asbestos roofs to get lung cancer?

It depends on the kind of asbestos.  Some kinds the risk is so low that it is worse to remove it, because of the added risk of stirring it up.  I'm assuming you mean mesothelioma, which afflicts about 2-3,000 new people each year in the US (out of all third of a billion of us!), so the actual risk is very, very low.  It also tends to be older folks.  Of course, none of that helps if it's you, but you should keep the risk in perspective, and remember to wear a seatbelt and not smoke before you worry about spending mega-bucks removing asbestos or buying a new home to get away from it.\n\nHere's some info on prevention:"

2,"which will work better?a crystal radio or a foxhole radio? please back up your answers?
i need this information for my science fair project.
They are essentially one in the same, with the minor difference that the foxhole radio is (was) built with whatever materials were available at hand.  \n\nYou will probably get better results with a more traditional crystal radio since you use an off the shelf Germanium diode for your detector, rather than trying to get one to work using pencil lead.  Plus, the crystal radio will be easier to tune.\n\nThe foxhole design would be a little more of a challenge, but your investment is virtually nill, versus a couple of dollars for the crystal radio...that is, unless you know someone with a lot of old electronic junk in their basement, in which case you could scavenge up what you need for pretty much free as well."
3,"Sans insurance, what's the best way to pay for plastic surgery?
I need to raise about $30K for reconstructive surgery following weight loss and I'm looking for ways to do it without taking out a loan.
Money never comes easy, does it?  I'm also trying to raise money - although for entirely different reasons - and it's not exactly a piece of cake, even though I have a steady paycheck.  The best advice I can give you is to immediately set aside some money each month into a special savings fund for your surgery.  You can also raise additional money by selling things online (I've made about $50.00 on EBay over the past several days, which is a start), holding a garage sale, getting an extra job, or starting some kind of small business (think crafts, making jewellery, or maybe childcare).  I also know someone who makes some GREAT homemade treats (brownies and cookies) and sells them to local businesses.  Maybe you could start a program where people pay to get a pre-made casserole or dinner dish from you that they just need to warm up in the oven?  Be creative, be disciplined, and believe in yourself!  Congratulations on your weight loss - I wish you the absolute best of luck!!"

2,"How would you define Titration in a non-technical way?
I know the definition of a Tirtration, but I am trying to figure out how to explain it in plain speak.
Sorry, titration is a technical term.\n\nTitration is a common laboratory method of quantitative/chemical analysis which can be used to determine the concentration of a known reactant. Because volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as volumetric analysis. A reagent, called the titrant, of known concentration (a standard solution) and volume is used to react with a measured quantity of reactant (Analyte). Using a calibrated burette to add the titrant, it is possible to determine the exact amount that has been consumed when the endpoint is reached. The endpoint is the point at which the titration is stopped. This is classically a point at which the number of moles of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte, or some multiple thereof (as in di- or tri- protic acids). In the classic strong acid-strong base titration the endpoint of a titration is when the pH of the reactant is just about equal to 7, and often when the solution permanently changes color due to an indicator."
2,"where does uranium come from?
Is it naturally occuring and what does it look like? Anybody?
Uranium, like all other heavier-than-iron elements, are created in the hearts of stars as they go supernova.  About ten billion years ago, a first generation supergiant star went supernova somewhere around here.  It seeded space with all of the elements other than hydrogen that were later swept up by gravity to form our own Star and Earth and the other planets of our solar system, as well as nearby stars like the Alpha Centauri system and Sirius.  (Hydrogen was made in the Big Bang.)\n\nOn Earth, uranium is generally found in isotopes U-235 and U-238 and to a lesser degree U-234.  It is highly prevalent, being found in most rock, although it was originally identified chemically as an extract of pitchblende.  It is most concentrated in uranium ore (.05-20% or 1-4 lbs of uranium oxide per ton of uranium ore, so that is the substance we mine for when we want uranium.\n\nUranium ore is present in most parts of the world, but the largest reserves are in Australia.  There's an excellent map at http://www.wise-uranium.org/umaps.html.  Select ""Cumulative Uranium Production to 2004"" and the various Uranium Resources options, which shows you the availability of uranium in terms of more or less concentrated uranium ore."

James IV had a son, James V.  Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) was the daughter of James V.  Mary was second in line for the English throne after her first cousin, once removed, Elizabeth I of England (their common ancestor was Henry VII of England)  Mary was convicted of treason and executed by order of Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth I was childless so Mary's son, James (James VI of Scotland) became known as King James I of England after the unification. \n\nThe lines cross constantly.

Possibly from Switzerland around 1911, specializing in psychiatry. Needed for a report. Thanks!
Bleuler, Eugen (oi'gən bloi' lər) , 1857–1939, Swiss psychiatrist. He taught (1898–1927) at the Univ. of Zürich, serving concurrently as director of Zürich's Burghölzi Asylum. Bleuler is well-known for his introduction (1908) of the term schizophrenia, formerly known as dementia praecox, and for his studies with schizophrenic patients. He concluded that the disease was not one of dementia, a condition involving organic deterioration of the brain, but one that consisted of a disharmonious state of mind in which contradictory tendencies exist together. His work was significant in its suggestion that psychological disturbances could be at the root of psychosis, and for his unprecedented belief that such patients were not incurable. A follower of Sigmund Freud and associate of Carl Jung, Bleuler was a long time member of Freud's Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. His son, Manfred Bleuler, conducted important follow-up studies in the Burghölzi hospital made famous by his father, and summarized these in _The Schizophrenic Disorders_ (1978)."
3,"preoperative skin care?
to search about care of the skin before an operation
Immediately before operating they will scrub your skin with a cleanser that will kill the bacteria and it is very harsh.  In the meantime try something for your skin every day.  It is always important to take care of your skin.  \n\nTry the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne etc. The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts. This helps prevent breakouts and other issues. \n\nThere are five steps to basic skin care: \n1. Cleanse\n2. Exfoliate\n3. Tone/Freshen\n4. Moisturize\n5. Protect\n\nThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one. The fifth step is protect. You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free. When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air. The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts. Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed. So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back. \n\nAlso it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand. They are formulated to work with one another. Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people. ;) \n\nTo even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution. The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them. These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone. You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin. The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards. \n\nI reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.\n\nTimewise 3 in 1 Cleanser (customized for skin type)\nTimewise Day Solution (at night use Night Solution)\nTimewise Moisturizer (customized for skin type)\nTimewise Firming Eye cream\nAdditional moisturizers if needed(intense for dry spots etc)\nFoundation (customized for skin type and shade) \nColor products (use all oil free and non-comedogenic)\n\nHope this was helpful!!\n\nMeganHill@MaryKay.com if you need anything else\nwww.MaryKay.com/MeganHill to check out the line\n\nMegan"

Using the conservation of angular momentum with:\nm = moment of inertia of people\nM= moment of inertia of earth\nw_1 = angular velocity of earth with people standing still\nw_p = angular velocity of FORWARD running people\nw_e = angular velocity of earth while people are running \n\nw_1*(m+M) = w_e*M + w_p*m\n\nso by the conservation of angular momentum you can see that you would effect the rotation of earth.  However m compared to M is essentially zero, as mentioned before (mass is in a way related to ineria) so setting m = 0, you get:\n\nw_1*(m+M) = w_e*M + w_p*m\nw_1M = w_e*M\nw_1 = w_e\n\nThe effect that this would have is practically none so no you will not change the direction but, yes you do slow the earth down a tiny, tiny, minuscule amount."
3,"When someone yawns why does he/she set off a chain reaction making people round him yawn ???
Yawn ! YAwn ! Yawn !!! Why does this happen ?
From straightdope:\n\n""nobody really knows. Fact is, we don't know why people yawn, period.\n\nIt was long believed you yawned when there was too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in your blood. A part of your brain called the brain stem detected this and triggered the yawn reflex. Your mouth stretched wide and you inhaled deeply, shooting a jolt of oxygen into the lungs and thence to the bloodstream.\n\nSubsequently, you exhaled a lot of CO2. Often you'd stretch while yawning, which seemed to temporarily improve circulation. You yawned and stretched a lot more when you got tired because your breathing slowed down.\n\nOr so people thought. In recent years, though, a few radicals have said the preceding is all malarkey. Who knows, they say, maybe we yawn because it's too warm in the room.\n\nCecil isn't about to settle the issue here, and he doesn't need to. We merely observe that whatever yawn-inducing conditions prevail for you also apply to your friends.\n\nIf you're out late in some crowded dive, you're probably all tired, all warm under the collar, and all breathing the same stale air. You're probably all on the verge of a yawn, too, and the power of suggestion from seeing one person do it is enough to push everybody else over the edge.\n\nAdults rarely catch a case of the yawns from a child or animal, which tends to corroborate this idea.\n\nChildren usually have different sleep schedules and respiration rates from adults, so you would expect them to yawn at different times. Animals, on the other hand, often yawn not for physiological reasons but as a display of hostility, to which humans are evidently unresponsive."""

3,"How can someone regenerate his/her brain?
It is a well-known fact that ""extacy"" users damage and eventually lose their serotonin neurons. Those neurons that do not die, are still severely damaged and lose their axons, and thus their ability to communicate with neurons downstream. There must be a way to promote axon growth in those neurons which are not dead, but are simply ""de-axonized"". \n   One possible method is to take Inosine, a supplement that is readily available at any vitamin shop. Inosine has recently been shown to regenerate axons in damaged spinal cord neurons in mice (in vivo!), when administered parenterally. Of course this is a long way from human brain neurons (administered orally), but there is still a chance that this may prove to be somewhat effective.\n   Does anyone know of, or can anyone suggest another possible method? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Well, our professor was telling us about the possibility of applying stem cell technology in this area. Embryonic stem cells when given the right environmental cues can develop into neurons. Alternatively, Schwann cells which are the ones that wrap around the axons and allow for conduction can also be generated from embryonic stem cells. Hope that helps."

2,"How do you put gears and motors together?
I've been trying to do some robotics like work.  I can figure out how to put the gears and motors and everything together in my head, but I have no idea how to get everything to actually work physically.  Like, how do I get the gear to stay there?  How do I mount a motor somewhere?  I've been stuck on this sort of thing for a very long time, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
There are several ways to attach a gear to a motor output shaft.\n\nIt mostly depends on your motor shaft and the amount of torque your motor can produce, and the type of gearing you are using (worm gear, planetary, sprocket).\n\nIf the shaft is even all the way across (usually the case with small motors such as those used for model train sets, etc) most of the gears are just pressed on and are usually plastic.  If not much torque is needed or used you could press the gear on, rough up the outside of the motor shaft and simply apply some high strength glue.\n\nIf the motor shaft is tapered then the mating gear must also be tapered and these are most likely pressed fit or heat fitted.  Heat fitting usually has one of the best and tightest fits.  This is how larger steel train wheels are mounted to the shafts. \n\nSometimes the motor has a tapered shaft and a threaded end.  If this is the case then a nut is used to apply torque to the gear which holds it in place on the tapered shaft.  It is also common that the taper has ""teeth"" which will bite into the softer material of the gear.\n\nIf the shaft of the motor looks like a D then you gear either needs to have key that holds it to the shaft or must have the D cutout in the gear also.\n\nIf the shaft has a groove cut in the top of it then your gear must also have a groove cut into it, and a square key is used to hold the gear to the motor output shaft.\n\nSometimes the shafts are special keyed to match special keyed gears.  In this case its very hard not to use the gears that were meant to go on it.  Such would be the case if your output shaft itself looks like a toothed long gear.\n\nAll and all its probably best to find a kit that comes with a motor that will suit your needs and a bunch of interchangeable gears.  Try the below site.\nhttp://www.robotstorehk.com/motors/motors.html\n\nHope this helps some."

please suggest the name of the books that i can refer to learn graph and chart analysis.
Wikipedia search Functions.\n\nAn easy method?  Sorry.  There aren't any.  It takes work.  \n\nThe first step is to learn how to graph and chart.  Then you must learn about functions, what they are and how they are used.\n\nAnalysis is a whole branch of mathematics! but what you need to get started is some calculus.  Work through an Introductory calculus textbook and you will be well on your way to understanding.  If you don't have any algebra yet you need that and maybe some trigonometry first.  Statistics and probability for some charts.  You need to be able to use the following concepts in order to analyze a graph: limit, slope, tangent, discrete, smooth, normal, rate of change, cumulative, integral, maxima, minima, inflection,  path integral, intersection.  Some introductory books on physics might be a good place to begin to see how graphs are used to communicate ideas.  Visit your local library."

Hey everyone. I am writing to ask what does it mean when a guy has a hard bump on his penis. I was checking out my dude's privates and saw a hard bump that looks like it has a scab on it. He has had this bump for over a year and says that it is a ""mole."" I am scared that if we have sex I will contract an STD. What the heck it this. It does not look like a mole to me...it looks more like a wart or something, but it is hard and has a scab on it. Could it be  HIV or herpes. he has had it in the same spot for a long time and never has had another one.
My guess, it's probably a wart.  Haven't you ever heard of genital warts?  It's caused by the HPV virus that 80% of the population carries.  It can cause warts on both men and women, and it can cause cervical cancer in women.  I had a hysterectomy at 28, because of my cervix.  Use a condom.  I wouldn't say it is herpes, because herpes only flare up every now and then, usually during stress, but the warts will sometimes stay until they are removed."

2,"How often do ""roll waves"" really occur?
In the movie ""Posidon"" a roll wave hit the boat, they said in the movie it is very rare.  How often do they occur and do we really know about them?
The type of wave you are refering to is not a tsunami. These types of waves are more often called ""freak waves"" or ""rogue waves"" in oceanographic literature. Tsunamis are only evident in shallow water and even when passing over seamounts are not generally noticeable to a passing ship. \n\nRogue or freak waves are rare, and since we have been positioning oil rigs offshore we have been able to observe and measure more of them that we previously had reports about.  The ""New Year Wave"" was reported by an oil platform in the North Sea off of Norway and measured at 25.6 meters in height. This was considerably more than the platform designers anticipated. I don't have exact statistics but I have heard anecdotal stories of waves of this height passing oil rigs during Hurricane Katrina last year in the Gulf of Mexico. The problem with measuring these waves during a hurricane is that the oil rigs are normally evacuated in advance and instrumentation often fails to survive the wave.  A number of oil rigs were lost during the hurricane. \n\nHere is a good website discussing current research on rogue waves:\nhttp://www.math.uio.no/~karstent/waves/index_en.html\n\nThe BBC did an interesting documentary on Freak Waves that makes them sound very alarming as a hazard to ships and gives some examples of close calls by passenger liners:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/freakwave.shtml"

7,"Who came up with Santa Claus?

The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends. It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. One of the best known of the St. Nicholas stories is that he saved three poor sisters from being sold into slavery or prostitution by their father by providing them with a dowry so that they could be married. Over the course of many years, Nicholas's popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors. His feast day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. This was traditionally considered a lucky day to make large purchases or to get married. By the Renaissance, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in Europe. Even after the Protestant Reformation, when the veneration of saints began to be discouraged, St. Nicholas maintained a positive reputation, especially in Holland.\n\nSt. Nicholas made his first inroads into American popular culture towards the end of the 18th century. In December 1773, and again in 1774, a New York newspaper reported that groups of Dutch families had gathered to honor the anniversary of his death. \n\nThe name Santa Claus evolved from Nick's Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). In 1804, John Pintard, a member of the New York Historical Society, distributed woodcuts of St. Nicholas at the society's annual meeting. The background of the engraving contains now-familiar Santa images including stockings filled with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. In 1809, Washington Irving helped to popularize the Sinter Klaas stories when he referred to St. Nicholas as the patron saint of New York in his book, The History of New York. As his prominence grew, Sinter Klaas was described as everything from a ""rascal"" with a blue three-cornered hat, red waistcoat, and yellow stockings to a man wearing a broad-brimmed hat and a ""huge pair of Flemish trunk hose.""\n\nIn 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, an Episcopal minister, wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled, ""An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas."" Moore's poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject, is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a ""right jolly old elf"" with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head! Although some of Moore's imagery was probably borrowed from other sources, his poem helped to popularize the now-familiar idea of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve—in ""a miniature sleigh"" led by eight flying reindeer, whom he also named—leaving presents for deserving children. ""An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,"" created a new and immediately popular American icon. In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore's poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His cartoon, which appeared in Harper's Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves, and his wife, Mrs. Claus."
2,"Is the effect of mutation directly shown on an individual or does it show up in the next generation?
In other words, does mutation affect the somatoplasm or the germplasm?
There are several possible answers. I don't think you really needed the words ""somatoplasm"" and ""germplasm"" in your question. Those are sort of obscure terms, and technically they refer to the cytoplasm in either a somatic cell or a germ cell, when I think you really meant to refer to the cells themselves. A somatic cell is any cell in the body that is not a reproductive cell, and a germ cell, or a gamete, is a sperm or egg or a precursor (which I can tell you know, but I thought I'd make things less obscure).\n\nSo in a way, your question contains its own answer. A germline mutation would be a change in the DNA in a cell that is going to become an egg or sperm. This sort of mutation is one that could be passed on to the offspring, assuming that the mutation was not lethal. It would be observed in the next generation if it was dominant, and not masked by supressor genes.\n\nA somatic mutation could have several outcomes. There are several systems of DNA repair machinery that would first try to repair the damage. If these failed, certain types of damage would trigger a process known as apoptosis, which is basically a self destruct sequence for the cell. This keeps damaged cells from causing additional damage. When mutations affect either the DNA repair pathways, the apoptosis pathway, or both, they can lead to cancer by allowing defective cells to survive.\n\nThe outcome of a somatic mutation is going to depend on what is mutated though. In an adult, where pretty much all of your cells have decided what they are going to be and have become that type of cell (neuron, muscle, skin, etc), certain genetic programs will be on or off in each cell. If there is a mutation in something the cell doesn't need, it might not notice. Then again, if the mutation causes something to be turned on when it should be off, that could cause problems, and again, that is exactly the sort of thing that leads to cancer.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting asides to this question, so if you are curious about other aspects of mutations, ask away..."

It will be hard to find a creditor without extreme high intrest. You have to find a secured credit card. For example you send this card an amount of a $1000 as colateral and in exchange they will provide a credit card with an intrest that is backed by your money.

HELLO! \n\nThere isn't a job at hand to rebuild the place, not at all.\n\nThese people are expressing the mindset you are questioning, the ability to change. Admittedly some will stay local and help where they can, but there are those who cannot fathom the thought.\n\nAnother major point:\n\nATTITUDE.\n\nA positive or realistic attitude will look forward to the opportunity present, whereas a negatively minded individual will slip into the ""Why me, how can this be happening?"".\n\nThe physical barriers, again boils down to attitude. I'm sure that you've seen para-olympic sports. Those people who play basketball as an example. There are some within these ranks who never would have played the game, but due to an accident in life (forced change), and exposure to reality, they have besome involved in such activities.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nYoung couple driving home, have an accident. Guy dies, chick lives. Options faced, to feel sadness forever until death, or make the most of what you still have. This young lass, decides to get involved in sports, and does so well within three years, that she ends up representing her country at an elite level. The alternative to this, was that same lass, sitting in her chair feeling sorry for herself for the next forty years. Any preference?\n\nAttitude, it all boils down to that one word.\n\nLike the other respondents I enjoy variety, the challenge of a new experience, the opportunity to learn something new.

Because (no+1) is like adding +1 and -1, in other words the sum is zero.  When you cancel out the (no+1) from both sides in line 4, you are dividing by zero, which gives rise to all kinds of contradictions and paradoxes in mathematical proofs, even proofs like this one."

2,"Why don't we yawn in sleep?

We don;t necessarily know why humans yawn, whether its to increase oxygen intake, equalize barometric pressure...  We're not sure.  While you're asleep, however, the environmentmay not change all that much, and your body doesn't need a yawn to readjust.  If the reason we yawn is for increased oxygen, then the slower, deeper breaths keep the blood oxygen at an acceptable level.  If it's because of the barometric pressure, presumably it's not changing rapidly enough to force our bodies to make a gross adjustment like on an airplane.  If it's for another reason that we yawn... Well, I guess the sleep state preserves that, too."
2,"Give the life story of , Robert Hooke?

Robert Hooke, FRS (July 18, 1635 - March 3, 1703) was an English polymath who played an important role in the scientific revolution, through both experimental and theoretical work. His father's name was John Hooke and his mother unknown.\n\nBorn in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight, Hooke received his early education at Westminster School. In 1653, Hooke won a place at Christ Church, Oxford. There he met the chemist (and physicist) Robert Boyle, and gained employment as his assistant. It is possible that Hooke formally stated Boyle's Law, as Boyle was not a mathematician. In 1660, he discovered Hooke's law of elasticity, which describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. In 1662, Hooke gained appointment as Curator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its meetings. In 1665 he published a book entitled Micrographia, which contained a number of microscopic and telescopic observations, and some original biology. Indeed, Hooke coined the biological term cell -- so called because his observations of plant cells reminded him of monks' cells which were called ""cellula"". The hand-crafted, leather and gold-tooled microscope Hooke used to make these observations for ""Micrographia,"" is on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, DC. Also in 1665 he gained appointment as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College.\n\nRobert Hooke also achieved fame as Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant of Christopher Wren, helping to rebuild London after the Great Fire in 1666. He worked on designing the Monument, Royal Greenwich Observatory and the infamous Bethlem Royal Hospital (which became known as 'Bedlam').\n\nHe died in London in 1703. Although he was wealthy from his work in the City, he never married.\n\nIt seems that no authenticated portrait of him survives. In 2003 the historian Lisa Jardine claimed a recently discovered portrait represents Robert Hooke. However, Prof. Jardine's hypothesis was soon disproved by Prof. William Jensen (University of Cincinnati) and independently by the German researcher Andreas Pechtl (Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz). Actually, the portrait represents Jan Baptist van Helmont. A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man's head, that some have argued portrays Hooke. Both these claims remain in dispute, however. Moreover, the engraved frontispiece to the 1728 edition of Chambers' Cyclopedia shows as an interesting detail the bust of Robert Hooke.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Achievements \n1.1 Some of Hooke's significant achievements in science \n1.2 Inventions \n2 Hooke and Newton \n3 Hooke the architect \n4 Mass media \n5 Books \n6 External links \n \nAchievements\nIn addition to the book Micrographia and Hooke's Law, Hooke invented the anchor escapement and may also have invented the balance spring before Christiaan Huygens. Devices known as escapements regulate the rate of a watch or clock, and the anchor escapement represented a major step in the development of accurate watches. The balance spring also regulates the flow of energy from the mainspring of a timepiece. It coils and uncoils with a natural periodicity, allowing for fine adjustment of the period of ticks. Modern spring watches still use balance springs, and derivative designs of Hooke's anchor escapement remain in common use. In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades' Royal Society meetings was discovered in a cupboard in Hampshire, and the balance-spring controversy appears by evidence contained in those notes to be settled in favor of Hooke's claim.\n\n \nA flea - a drawing for Hooke's MicrographiaHistorians sometimes credit Hooke with inventing the compound microscope, a design consisting of multiple lenses (usually three - an eyepiece, a field lens and an objec"

3,"Do cats attack pregnant women? Can cats detect human breast milk?

Cat's shouldn't have a desire to attack a pregnant woman more than any other person. Cats have a much better sense of smell than people do, so they may be able to detect breast milk, but that shouldn't lead them to act any different towards a pregnant woman. The only threat a cat poses to a pregnant woman is toxoplasmosis. It is a chemical in some cat's feces that could lead to birth defects if it entered a pregnant woman's bloodstream. Pregnant women shouldn't scoop out or clean litter pans."
1,"Is belief voluntary?
I am told that I need to believe in Jesus to be saved.  But I have studied the Bible, have prayed, have thought, reasoned, and prayed again.  But I cannot believe in what they say I'm supposed to believe.  It is not because I'm evil or unwilling to face any truth.  It is not because I'm against God or depraved.  I simply see all this evidence against the idea of Jesus as God's divine Son who died for our sins, etc.  I cannot MAKE myself believe in this, even if I wanted to.  And there have been times I have wanted to.  But you can't believe in something when the evidence is so contrary to it, and when this evidence is clear and strong and right before you.\n\nIs belief really a choice?
Yes, I think (believe and feel) that belief is voluntary.\n\nThe yearning for answers, and the spritual hunger, is in all of us, but what we believe, or whether we believe, is a choice. An open mind is capable of seeing this. People who accept dogma blindly just can't see it.\n\nI've heard ""faith"" defined as belief without evidence. Me, I need evidence. (And to anyone who believes in God, that is how God made me!)\n\nI truly do not see how ANY completely honest person can insist they KNOW. We are all stumbling around in the dark, looking for the light.\n\nI feel like I'm babbling senslessly; hope some of this addressed your question!  :-)) \n\nMaybe sometimes to SEEK is more worthwhile than to be utterly convinced that one has FOUND."

7,"Why would a company invest in another company in stages?

I am assuming you are referring to the purchase of the underlying equity by a larger, more established company. The reason for this could be two-fold. There could be restrictions in place regarding the institutional ownership of the stock and subsequent purchases made there-in. Another reason, and more likely, is the fact of liquidity. Garnering a large number of shares of an illiquid stock could single-handedly manipulate the given equity leading to SEC investigations and such. And by investing in stages (known predominatly as ""scaling into a position"", they could evaluate on the go. For instance, the company that is being bought could have some current hindrances surrounding it. By scaling in, you can watch as some of the shady situations resolve themselves and you become more comfortable with the current share price."

I hate to be the philosopher but that is why the question still reamins. No one can accuratly tell what lies beyond the boundries of the universe. Is there another? Is it just white noise? I believe that space is infinite and our ""universe"" could well be a part of a cluster of ""multiverses"". i was once told that the universe is expanding in the same way that a balloon is blown up.

1,"Your Favorite Creature Of Mythology?
As well as the usual, such as unicorns, pixies, and the likes, what is your favorite mythological creature?
The Vetala!\n\nA vetala is a vampire-like being from Hindu mythology.The vetala are defined as spirits inhabiting corpses. These corpses may be used as vehicles for movement (as they no longer decay while so inhabited), but a vetala may also leave the body at will.\n\nIn Hindu folklore, the vetala is an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses. They make their displeasure known by troubling humans. They can drive people mad, kill children and cause miscarriages but they also guard their villages.\nThe vetala, like the bat, is associated with hanging upside down on trees found in cremation grounds and cemetaries\nEnlarge\nThe vetala, like the bat, is associated with hanging upside down on trees found in cremation grounds and cemetaries\n\nThey are hostile spirits of the dead trapped in the twilight zone between life and after-life. These creatures can be repelled by the chanting of holy mantras. One can free them from their ghostly existence by performing their funerary rites. Being spirits, unaffected by the laws of space and time, they have an uncanny knowledge about the past, present and future and a deep insight into human nature. Hence, many sorcerers seek to capture them and turn them into slaves.\n\nA sorcerer once asked King Vikramaditya to capture a vetala who lived in a tree that stood in the middle of a crematorium. The only way to do that was by keeping silent.\n\nHowever, every time Vikramaditya caught the vetala, the vetala would enchant the king with a story that would end with a question. No matter how hard he tried, Vikramaditya would not be able to resist answering the question. This would enable the vetala to escape and return to his tree. The stories of the vetala have been compiled in the book Baital Pachisi.\n\nThere is also a strong Vetala cult in the Konkan region, under the names of Betal, Vetal, etc. It seems, however, that the relation between the literay Vetala and this demigod's is feeble at best."

IS there a chance of fire?
Glass is non-conductive and was used as an insulator in homes and electric poles.  Since glass is non-conductive, lightning is not attracted to it and will not strike it.\n\nIf lightning could somehow be induced to strike glass, the most likely result would be that the bolt would melt a hole through the glass and continue to something more conductive on the other side.  There is very little chance that the glass would catch fire as silica (the basic material of glass) is not considered to be a flammable material."

3,"what is the anacardium-personality ?

Split Personality of Anacardium \n-- Dr. Manish Bhatia\n  \n  \nThe Anacardium patient does not merely shows the characteristics of split personality but instead it shows a complete picture of Schizophrenia. Before dealing with the mental picture of Anacardium, it is necessary to understand what are the basic characters of a split personality or a schizophrenic patient. So for the same reason, I quote the following text from the book ""Introduction to Psychology"" by ‘Hilgard and Atkinson’:\n\n""The word ‘schizophrenic’ is derived from the Greek word schizen (""to split"") and phren (""mind""). The split does not refer to multiple personalities, but rather to a splitting of the thought process from emotions. The primary characteristics of schizophrenia can be summarized as under:\n\nDisturbance of affect: The schizophrenic does not show emotions in a normal way. He usually appears dull and pathetic, or he may display inappropriate emotions. \nWithdrawal from active interchange with the realistic environment: The schizophrenic loses interest in the people and events around him. \nAutism: Withdrawal from reality is usually accompanied by absorption in an inner fantasy world. The state of self-absorption is known as autism. \nDelusion and hallucination: The most common delusions of the schizophrenic are the beliefs that external forces are trying to control his thoughts and actions (delusions of influence) or that certain people or groups are persecuting him (delusion of persecution). Auditory hallucinations are more common than visual ones-the schizophrenic frequently hears voices. When persecutory delusions or hallucinations are predominant, the person is called paranoid. He may become suspicious of friends or relatives, fear that they are poisoning him, complain that he is being watched, followed and talked about. \nBizarre behavior: the schizophrenic’s behavior may include peculiar gestures, movements, and repetitive acts that make no sense to the observer but are closely related to the schizophrenics fantasy world. \nDisturbed thought process."" \nAfter this basic discussion on schizophrenia, the mental symptoms of Anacardium are being listed in rubric forms. After going through the psychologists view-point given above and that of the homeopaths observation being listed below, no wise man will be left in any doubt as to the extent to which Anacardium presents the picture of split personality/ schizophrenia. \n\nThe mental symptoms of Anacardium depicting the Schizophrenic traits are:\n\nAnxiety:\n\nPursued as if, when walking \n\nBeside oneself, being \n\nCaress:\n\nCaressing husband and child, then pushes away \n\nChaotic, confused behavior \n\nConfusion of mind \n\nIdentity: duality, sense of\n\nContradict, disposition to\n\nDelusions/ Illusions/ Hallucinations:\n\nBed, someone is in, with him \n\nCall someone \n\nWith name, the absent mother or sister \n\nChild, is not hers \n\nDead, corpse on a bier, he himself was \n\nDead persons, sees \n\nDevil, he is \n\nDevil speaking in one ear, angel in the other, prompting to murder \n\nDouble, of being \n\nHusband, he is not her \n\nMind and body are separated \n\nPeople, sees \n\nBehind him, someone is \n\nPersecuted, he is \n\nPerson is in the room, another \n\nPossessed, being \n\nSoul, body was too small for \n\nSoul, body separated from \n\nSuperhuman control, is under \n\nThree persons, he is \n\nVoices, hears \n\nCalling his name \n\nWills, possessed of two \n\nDream, as if in a \n\nDuality, sense of \n\nFear, apprehension \n\nBehind, someone is \n\nDevil, of being taken by \n\nPeople, of \n\nPoisoned, of being \n\nGestures, automatic \n\nMemory, weakness of \n\nNames, for proper \n\nPersons, for \n\nRead, for what has \n\nSeen, for everything he has \n\nWord, of \n\nMistakes \n\nConfounds future with past \n\nPresent with future \n\nMood, alternating \n\nRecognize: relatives, does not recognize his \n\nStrange, everything seems "

3,"do you wear a bra during a massage?

Most women just wear panties with no bra. Most massage therapists are very respectful. You will be lying face down on a sheet for most of the treatment, and then when you need to turn over you will be draped with a sheet. They don't massage or go near your breasts or stomach. Wearing a bra gets in the way and you risk getting massage oil all over your bra if you keep it on."
7,"Does the Gap mistreat sweatshop workers?

This is a hard question to answer.\nMany Western companies exploit the ""cheap"" labour found in many developing nations. There is little reason to think that Gap is alone. In Thailand and China, the North Face (adventure gear co.) does have a reputation for some rather harsh policies toward workers there. But there are ethical questions all across the board. Nike sells $100 shoes, yet as little as $1 will actually be paid to the worker for a ridiculously long day of work. In recent months, Gap has especially come under the magnifying glass. Numerous anti [Gap] sweatshop campaigns dot the internet. Some groups claim that Gap uses physical harassment and unsafe working conditions to get their products on the shelves. Some workers have broken the silence and report that beatings and sexual harassment are a real and tangible part of how the company gets their products produced."
1,"Why is it when you're happy and going about your own way someone has to say smile you don't look happy?
Are you supposed to have a smile from ear to ear to make these people happy. I don't look angry (unless I really am) generally I look ok, no frown just normal and every so often out of the blue, shopping or something, I get from someone 'smile' or 'smile you dont look happy' Do I really have to smile constantly? My face would get really sore If I do! Of course I do smile at times when I want to. What are some good comebacks for this?
No you don't have to smile constantly.  People who say things like that are damn nosy and looking to poke in your business.  Tell them smiles are not synonymous with happiness and walk off.  They'll be frowning while trying to figure out what you just said, and you'll be smiling at your own cleverness!"
2,"How come this be...?
If there is no atmosphere on the moon, then how come the flag hoisted by Neil Armstrong on the moon, as shown in the video flutter..?
Technically, there is a very, very, very, very, very insignificant atmosphere on the Moon.\n\nBut that isn't why the flag ""shook."" There is a bar supporting the flag not only from the side, but from the top as well. That is why the flags is stretched out.\n\nAlso, they had to plant the flag into the ground below the lunar dust, and they struggled a little with this. After finally getting it into the ground, the bar supporting the flag wobbled (because the astronauts were pushing and pulling on it), and that made the flag flutter.\n\nJust because there is little or no air doesn't mean things can't be moved by another means (the astronauts are moving on the Moon, after all, why can't a flag pole that's been given a little kinetic energy).\n\nIt should also be noted, that when Neil and Buzz left the surface of the Moon, the flag was knocked over because of the exhaust from the LM. They planted the flag too close to their spacecraft. This ""problem"" was fixed on future missions.\n\nAND something to THINK ABOUT: If the flag were fluttering because of air, then why isn't there dust blowing around in that video, too?"

2,"are tornadoes common in tennesse?
in the southeastern states do tornadoes often touchdown?
http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/img/ttor8099.gif shows tornado frequency from 1980-1999.  You can see basically every state east of the Rockies is an area of tornadoes to some degree except Maine.\n\nWhat this map says is that it ranges from about .2 to .9 tornado days per year across Tennessee.\n\nThis means that if you lived anywhere outside of the real large Appalachians in Tennessee, a tornado passes within 25 miles of your house about once every 2 years (as often as almost every year near Memphis).  So while it's not as common as the Plain States or even Florida or Colorado (the large spikes in those latter two regions are probably due to some statistical anomalies... though both are surprisingly active (if you check the significant tornado map (http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/sigt2195.gif), you get a better idea of real patterns), tornadoes are still quite common to Tennessee... specifically March-May (you can view a date based loop here http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/tanim/torw8099.html).\n\nYou can also look at a lot more data at the main page http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/totalthreat.html.  This is the data the Storm Prediction Center is using for guidance to some of their probability forecasts.\n\n\nFrom my own experience (I don't live in Tennessee), I remember quite a few events effecting the state before this year, including the major tornado outbreaks of November 9-10, 2002 and May 4, 2003 which socked much of the country, but of which they got a lot of the punch.  I also remember a video I've seen of a significant tornado going through downtown Nashville.  So they definitely get them, as do all the states you may be hearing about on the news.\n\nHope I was able to answer your question,\nGod bless,\nShane"
1,"Did Muhammad(pbuh) mentioned in bible?
The Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.""\n[Bible - John 14:26]\n\nJesus, the son of Mary, said, ""A messenger will come after me,named Ahmad.""\n[Quran 61:6]\n\nThe chief priests and Levites asked John the Baptist, ""If you are not the Christ (Messiah), and not Elijah - are you THAT Prophet?""\n[John 1:20]\n \n\nWhen the chief priests and Levites asked John the Baptist who he was, they asked him in a very strange way. First the questioned him as to whether or not he was the anticipated ""Messiah"" [Christ in Koine Greek]. He was not the ""Messiah"" that had hoped for. Next they asked if he was the prophet Elijah and again he tells them, ""No."" Now comes the really strange part. Finally, they asked him if he is ""That Prophet?""\n\n1. Are you Christ? - [No]\n2. Are you Elijah? - [No] \n3. Are you THAT Prophet? - [No] \nWhat did they mean by ""That Prophet?"" We of course, know who the ""Christ"" is. After all, Christians should know that ""Christ"" is merely a shortened form of the Koine Greek word ""christos,"" intended to mean the Hebrew word ""Messiah.""\n\nThe Jews of two thousand years ago were definitely looking for the Messiah, who it was foretold in their books, would come and lead them to victory over their oppressors and thus gain for them mastery over this world. They were very oppressed under Roman domination and even their own Jewish kings were seen as nothing more than puppets or agents for the disbelievers. Certainly, they would have been most happy to see someone come on the scene who would defeat their Roman masters and slave drivers.\n\nThen the priests and Levites asked John the Baptist if he might be the prophet Elijah, returning back after hundreds of years being away. There was the notion amongst them that Elijah would come back. But again, John the Baptist is denying he is Elijah.\n\nThen, who is he? They wonder at this man living out in the desert and forsaking wealth and luxury and fasting, avoiding the material attractions of life.\n\nAgain, they ask John the Baptist who he is. ""Are you THAT Prophet?"" And one more time he denies being ""THAT Prophet,"" but then he does tell them about someone who will come after him soon, whom he claims he is not worthy to even unlace his shoes.\n\nHowever, this does not answer the question, ""Who were they expecting besides the Messiah?"" Could it be they were looking for someone like Muhammad? (Could be)\n\nWho is THAT Prophet? - \n\nKeep reading and learn who ""That Prophet"" is and what other proofs can be discovered within the Holy texts to support this idea.\n\n____________________\n\nFor centuries Muslims have believed Jesus, peace be upon him, was ""THAT Prophet"" mentioned in these words of the Gospel of John. The Quran states one of the important features of Jesus' mission was to give the ""bashir"" or 'glad tidings' of the coming of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. During his short missionary career that lasted not more than three years, and which was overshadowed by the hostile attitude of his own people, Jesus gave them the good news of Ahmad, (one of the forms of ""Muhammad"") the last messenger of God, who would perfect the divine teaching both in theory and in practice. The Quran mentions that, Jesus says:\n\n""O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah {Almighty God} (sent) to you, confirming the Law (Torah or Old Testament) before me, and giving glad tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."" (Surah 61:6)\nThe Quran gives the name as Ahmad, one of several ways to say Muhammad's name. Just as we have in English the name Joseph, and often use a shorter form such as ""Joe"" or the familiar form, ""Joey,"" 
By the way, Prophet Muhammad is mentioned BY NAME in Song of Solomon 5:16 - In original Hebrew it says ""Hiko Mamitakim, Vikuloh MUHAMMADIM Zehdudi vizahrei Bayna jerusalem""...\n\nUnfortunately the translators of the Bible translated the the Name Muhammadim to Altogather Lovely..\n\nFurthermore there are many other prophecies of Prophet Muhammad in the Bible which are fitting Prophet Muhammad like a glove and not to the Holy Spirit..\n\nFor more Information, contact me at shiekhtm@yahoo.com"
2,"Physics Conservation of Angular Momentum?
A track is mounted on a large wheel that is free to turn with negligible friction about a vertical axis.  A toy train of mass m is placed on a track, and with the system initially at rest, the train’s electrical power is turned on.  The train reaches speed 0.15 m/s with respect to the track.  What is the angular speed of the wheel if its mass is 1.1 m and its radius is 0.43 m? (Treat the wheel as a hoop, and neglect the mass of the spokes and hub.) \n\nThe answer is 0.17 rad/s but I am not sure how to get this answer, and I really want to understand, please me help me!
Conservation of angular momentum must be considered as PhysicsDude mentioned. The thing to keep in mind here is the speed of the train given is ""with respect to the track"". The train is moving in one direction and the wheel/track is the other. If the wheel were not moving the speed of the train would be the 0.15 m/s, however since the wheel is moving counter to the train, and observer standing by the track (that is moving on the wheel along with the track) would see the speed of the train as faster than the actual train speed by an amount equal to the speed of the track. \n\nVr = Vtt + Vtr\n\nwhere Vr (=0.15 m/s) is the relative speed, Vtt is the speed of the toy train, and Vtr is the speed of the track.\n\nNow, considering conservation of angular momentum\n\nLtt = Itt*wtt = Itr*wtr = Ltr\n\nwhere Itt is the moment of inertia of the train, wtt is the angular speed of the train, Itr is the moment of inertia of the track, and wtr is the speed of the track. The two equate since the intial angular momentum is zero so that the two must cancel each other out after the train has started moving. The moments of inertia are:\n\nItt = m*r^2\nItr = 1.1*m*r^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the train (1.1*m is the mass of the wheel/track), and r is the radius of the wheel. Recall that the angular speed is the linear speed divided by the radius. This means that the above conservation equation is\n\nm*r^2*wtt = m*r^2*(Vr/r - wtr) = 1.1*m*r^2*wtr\n\nSolving for the angular speed of the wheel/track (wtr)\n\nwtr = Vr/(2.1*r)\n\nPlugging in the values given\n\nwtr = (0.15 m/s)/(2.1*0.43 m) = (0.15 m/s)/(0.903 m)\n\nwtr = 0.166 rad/s"

Yes, there are two types of DNA: 1) Nuclear DNA (found in the nucleus) and 2) Mitochondrial DNA (obviously, found in the mitochondria).  Nuclear DNA consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes - 23 from mom and 23 from dad.  Mitochondrial DNA is received from your mom (whether you are a boy or a girl!).  Mitochondrial DNA is circular (nuclear DNA is linear), like bacterial DNA, which is one reason why it is thought that mitochondria may have originally been derived from bacteria.\nThere are only 13 genes in Mitochondrial DNA.  Nuclear DNA contains a lot more genes, with the latest estimates at about 23,000."
3,"How many chucks could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

Well, Woodchucks can chuck around 35 cubic feet of dirt in the course of digging a burrow. So in reason if a woodchuck could chuck 35 cubic feet of dirt he could chuck an equivalence of 700 pounds of wood. In a more logical sense I believe that if the woodchuck chucked the amount of wood that she sells seashells on the seashore divided by how many pickles Peter Piper picks would give us the true answer."

Wood blocks absorbing water is no doubt is imbibition.Imbibition is the diffusion of water molecules through any dead wall,.This is evident in case of dry seeds absorbing water. \nAdhesion is the attachment of water molecules to the cell wall.Cohesion is the attachment of water molecules with in them selves to make a water column. IN water absorption process, these two forces act and conduct water in up ward way against gravity.\nthe same thing applies to wood blocks also , offcourse they are immersed here\nThe same thing happens in the wood block,of course are immersed in water\nThese water molecules are bonded with in them selves by cohesive forces and they are attached to xylem wall by adhesive forces to form a water column in side xylem vessels\n.Because of these forces the water travels to the tip of very tall trees and of course to the branches also"

Dust is a general name for minute solid particles of diameters less than 500 micrometers (otherwise see sand or granulates) and, more generally, for finely divided matter. On Earth, dust occurs in the atmosphere from various sources: soil dust lifted up by wind, volcanic eruptions, and pollution are some examples; airborne dust is considered an aerosol and can have a strong, local radiative forcing on the atmosphere and significant effects on climate. In addition, if composed of a flammable substance (such as flour), it can be an explosion hazard.\n\nFor more info on dust, visit:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"

Our society's 'etiquette' now leans towards 'not being racist' as the ideal. In past generations this has not been the case, and it's only been a few years, really, since segregation was the norm. It's 'hip' to be non-racist, and those who ARE racist know this and do what they have to in order to fit in to our society. It's almost scarier than blatent racism, because you don't know it's fermenting inside of some people unless you're really observant. However, 'among their own'...whatever and wherever that is, racists carry on with their racist jokes, and hatred. \n\nIn the past, racists were the norm could display their racism freely and without scorn, but now, only a couple of generations later, their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren who choose to follow the tradition of hatred towards those with different skin than their own, must do it in secret or be ostracized. Not only that, there are laws now that we didn't used to have. In most work places today, to admit and freely display one's racism would cost a person their job. \n\nIt's going to take generations upon generations to even make a dent in the mindset passed down by racists of the past. The more we model non-racism, and the more we inform them, and the more we display our acceptance of ALL of us on this planet, the more likely racists will be to 'come around' and join us, and if they don't, their children probably will in spite of them. \n\nYour question is a good one.

In most  states it would be on the grounds that the unit is in an unsafe or unsanitary condition.  Start with a written complaint that threatens you leaving if the noise doesn't end.\n\nYou will need to be able to document when you've complained and some photos of the ceiling damage will help as well.

A police report will back up your claims of noise and the time it happens.\n\nMost likely the landlord  will withhold your deposit when you leave so you will have to sue to get it back.  This trip into court is where all of that evidence will be needed.  The judge will want to see and hear it.  You will also need to get copies of the police reports for the court.

2,"What is Einstein's theory of relativity and what does it mean?
What does it stand for? I need answers quickly!
everyone else is pretty much right, it's just that everything in the universe is relative to an object's frame of reference. nothing is absolute. for example, you're on a bike moving at 10 m/s. you throw a baseball at 15 m/s relative to your frame of reference. to someone standing nearby, from their frame of reference the ball is moving at 25 m/s (the 15m/s you threw it at plus the velocity you're already moving.)  now, to a car moving slowly along the road at 25 m/s, the ball is not moving at all. it is stationary in the frame of reference of the car because they are moving at the same speed as each other. this is why it doesnt feel like you're moving backwards when you're in a car at a constant velocity(only when you speed up or slow down). also, if you drop a book in a moving vehicle, it will go straight down, not down and to the back.  that is because everything in the car is moving at the same speed, they're all in the same frame of reference. if you were to drop a  ball outside of the window of the car(assuming no air resistance) the ball would be moving at the same speed as the car and continue bouncing alongside the car(in reality it slows down substancially due to air resistance.) to you the ball would be stationary, aside from bouncing up and down, but to an outside observer, it would be moving forward.  it's all relative... that's the basic concept but there's also a lot more, more advanced applications involving the distortion of time as you reach near-light speed velocities... pretty interesting stuff."
3,"how can ı get a good sleep. ı always wake up tired.?

cut off the caffiene earlier in the day and reduce fluids taken later on in the eve so you are not getting up to the bathroom in the night. Make sure you have at least 6-8 hours to not be disturbed. 8 hours is the best, 6 is still shorting yourself!! you can try stuff like chamomile tea also. Don't go to bed on a stuffed belly, don't use alcohol to put yourself to sleep.\n Another thought is the chance you have sleep apnea. That can disturb your sleep enough to ruin any benefit of the sleep, no matter how many hours of sleep you get. Alot of folks with sleep apnea don't even wake up enough to realize what is going on and spend a long time wondering why they 'get enough hours of sleep' and yet are totally fried and unrested the next am. If you are overweight your chances of having sleep apnea are very increased. Sleep apnea can be livable and taken care of. Talk to the doc about the chances of sleep apnea. Also you can try sleeping in more of a recliner chair position.\n Check w the doc esp if you are overweight, although skinny folks can have apnea also!"

1,"Does anyone know anything about Centering Prayer?

Centering Prayer is a method of prayer, which prepares us to receive the gift of God's presence, traditionally called contemplative prayer. It consists of responding to the Spirit of Christ by consenting to God’s presence and action within. It furthers the development of contemplative prayer by quieting our faculties to cooperate with the gift of God’s presence. \n\nCentering Prayer facilitates the movement from more active modes of prayer — verbal, mental or affective prayer — into a receptive prayer of resting in God. It emphasizes prayer as a personal relationship with God. At the same time, it is a discipline to foster and serve this relationship by a regular, daily practice of prayer. It is Trinitarian in its source, Christ-centered in its focus, and ecclesial in its effects; that is, it builds communities of faith.\n\nCentering Prayer is drawn from ancient prayer practices of the Christian contemplative heritage, notably the Fathers and Mothers of the Desert, Lectio Divina, (praying the scriptures), The Cloud of Unknowing, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila.. It was distilled into a simple method of prayer in the 1970’s by three Trappist monks, Fr. William Meninger, Fr. Basil Pennington and Abbot Thomas Keating at the Trappist Abbey, St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts."

Yet The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains that the hare was “the symbol of fertility in ancient Egypt.” Thus when children hunt for Easter eggs, supposedly brought by the Easter rabbit, “this is not mere child’s play, but the vestige of a fertility rite.”—Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend, volume 1, page 335.\n\n“Ancient pagans used the rabbit as a symbol of the abundant new life of the spring season. . . . The first record of the bunny as an Easter symbol is found in Germany about 1572,” says The Catholic Encyclopedia for School and Home. Likewise, the Easter-time use of hot cross buns, brightly colored eggs, or chocolate bells has its roots in pagan religion. And, incredibly, the very name Easter (used in some languages) relates to a pagan deity. The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible states that Easter was “originally the spring festival in honor of the Teutonic goddess of light and spring known in Anglo-Saxon as Eastre. As early as the 8th century the name was transferred by the Anglo-Saxons to the Christian festival designed to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.”"

2,"science question?
what advantages is there for a population to have variation in the next generation? why not have all of the next generation exactly alike?
Well, if the environment of this population were to remain unchanging, then yes, why change once an optimal adaptation has been reached?\nBut environment is not unchanging!\n\nNatural selection is an evolutionary mechanism that acts ""erasing the worse"". This implies that there have to be differences (there is no ""worse"" without something ""better""), which are are provided by the variations from one generation to the next. However, these variations are random and have no meaning by themselves.\nThe biological ""meaning"" and ""value"" of these differences depends on the environment: a feature that has high ""adaptive value"" in a given environment might have lower adaptive value once that environment changes, and other characters will be more advantageous. Some variations are just incompatible with life. \nThus, advantages, fitness and adaptations are always relative to the environment. Without inherited variations, it is not possible to respond to environmental changes. \nAnd environments, formed by the complex interaction of very many living and non-living factors, are constantly changing."
1,"Off the Hook?
What situation is meant by the phrase:\n\nThe phone's been ring'n ""off the hook""
On old-fashioned telephones, the receiver (the piece with the mouthpiece, later also the earpiece) rested on a hook-shaped switch when the phone was not in use.  When the hook was down, the phone was ""hung up,"" ready to receive calls.  When the receiver was lifted, a spring lifted the hook so that the phone could be dialed and/or answered, considered ""off-the-hook.""\n\nThe phrase, which means that the phone has been ringing constantly, refers to the (tongue-in-cheek) notion that if the phone rings enough times, the receiver would vibrate off of the hook on its own.  In reality, this would almost never happen, due to the design of the phone, but it was just a saying."

7,"what country in new zealand first's freezing work open in 1881?
thus is a question that i needed to find out on the internet
Hi\n\nYour question is a little confusing because you ask 'what country in New Zealand.......'. New Zealand is the name of the country. The first example of freezing meat in New Zealand was in December 1881 at Port Chalmers which is in the City of Dunedin which is in the province of Otago.\n\nThe meat was destined for England, but unfortunately the refrigeration equipment fractured and the meat had to be sold locally. After repairs, the ship was finally loaded on 11 February 1882 and sailed on 15 February. It arrived in London with its cargo of 4,931 carcasses of mutton, lamb and pork, 98 days later on 24 May.\n\nI hope this answers your intended question."

It never fails that everyday between 1 and 3pm I get extremely tired. I get so sleepy that sometimes I even find myself lying down and falling asleep. I try not to let that happen because when I wake up I'm really grouchy. Usually, if I force myself to stay awake it only lasts for those two hours. Is this normal? Should I let myself fall asleep and try not to be so grouchy or should I do something to help me stay awake?
It happens to me and some friends. And it doesn't help if that period is right after lunch. I find that drinking cold water (not soda) and taking a walking break outdoors do me a lot of good. It's even better to have a ""sleepy partner"" to take the walk with you so you guys can talk and laugh."

The landlord/property manager wants three things of a resident: 1) pay the rent 2) treat the apartment well 3) be a good neighbor.

if it's infected, you'll also not be in the mood to eat much of anything.  the wound will be red, swollen, warm, and probably leaking clear or white fluids.  (obviously, it'll be a little red and such just because it was cut there).  i would imagine an infection of a surgical wound would give a normally high fever (maybe at least 101 or so).  if it hit you within a couple days after surgery and has been going on for four straight day's, i'd say see the doc soon."

I want to shave around my penis, but im affraid it won't grow back. how long will it take to grow back if it does? what should i use to do it? everyone says it will itch so what should i use to help it not so bad?
Shave with a razor and shaving cream, shave in one direction to limit the irritation. After you get done clean off with water, and let it air dry. Drying it with a towel will only irritate your skin. After it dries use rubbing alcohol a couple of times a day until the irritation goes down.\n\nYes the hair will grow back, it starts growing back within about 5 days or so.\n\nAnd yes it will itch butthe Alcohol helps, and if you continue to shave that will go away as well."

You are not the problem, society is! As a person with a disability, to many people you don't exist or are somehow less of a person. The first thing to do is learn to speak up for yourself. The second is to tell your partner you don't necessarily want him to answer for you. You have to develop some assertiveness--the next time this happens, tell the person inquiring about your situation one of two things: (1) If it's someone you know or should care about for some reason, give them a short and sweet explanation; (2) If it's some random idiot just being nosy, stupid, or cruel, tell them you can speak for yourself and that it's really none of their business. (But do it in a humorous or straightforward way so it's not nasty.) People develop all sorts of whacky assumptions about those of us with disabilities, and it's up to us to squash those assumptions with a sense of humor, education, or just plain ""take no B.S."" thinking."

2,"what type of sampling is it when you are taking the first 100 numbers....please help...?

It sounds like random sampling... why?\nI am not sure what you mean, if it were simply, say, the first 100 names in the Manchester telephone system's number data base, then it would not be random because only a relatively few people whose last name began with an A would be included.\nNow, if all those numbers were mixed up in a hat, and the first 100 drawn were to be used, then the sample is random because anyone in the number data base could theoretically been chosen.\nLet's have a little fun with this. \nIt is impossible to sample, say all 110,000 chocolate bars made by a company in one month. However, quaity control wants to make sure each has a certain number of nuts in them\nSo as the bars are completed at end of the assembly line, once a week, a quality control person randomly grabs 100 bars and counts the nuts in it. Again, any of the 110,000 could have been chosen, but the person merely grabs 100 of them.\nThrough inferential statistics the company can estimate with high accuracy if all the candy bars produced have the right amount of nuts by merely counting nuts in 100 bars. The key: ALL bars had an equal chance of being selected; this is what made the sampling random."

I was just wondering, which of the four elements (solid, liquid, gas, plasma) is a flame?  I don't think it's a liquid or a solid but it might be plasma (molocules splitting themselves apart)
A flame is a mixture of gases undergoing a chemical reaction that gives off enough heat to continue the reaction in the molecules that have not yet reacted.  We get the impression that solids (like wood) burn, but it's really mainly the gases coming off of them that burn.  That's why it's easier to start a hot piece of wood on fire than a cold piece of wood.  The initial piece has to be hot enough so that the flamable products escape from it in vapor form."
2,"Kentucky or Tennessee?
For me...\nTN rocks, KY sucks!\n\nTennessee: As a Texan, I can relate to TN people well. Very laid back, mellow, friendly, warm. Just a great place to be. Beale St. in Memphis, Opry in Nashville, the Smokies in the east, Jack Daniels, Kentucky Lake, Reelfoot Lake, Oak Ridge, so many neat things to see and do. There are four distinct seasons, but winter is still relatively mild (well, cold by Texas standards, but still...) Plus, it's a football state! It also has great schools like Rhodes, Vanderbilt, UT, Belmont, and the Univ. of the South.\n\nKentucky: beautiful state, but that's it. I found people there to be impolite and pretentious, small towns are very ""set in their ways"" and clandestine, the drivers are terrible, and the educational system is worse. (Plus, I can't stand all of the obnoxious UK fans around Lexington.) Even though it has neat landmarks such as Mammoth Cave, KFC, and Keeneland, I try to spend as little time there as I can while visiting family or on business.
You are forgetting about Louisville, the Kentucky Derby, Bluegrass music, the Cumberland Pass, and Daniel Boone.  Plenty of history there.  \n\nAnd BTW, is Louisville University any worse than UT?  And who is the perennial top 5 in Basketball?  I'll give you two hints: They dress either in cardinal red or in wildcat blue.  And what is the best known bat in the major leagues?  Is it not the Louisville Slugger?\n\nMy sister used to live in Memphis.  Nobody more racist in the whole Mississippi Valley than the people of Memphis.  Stuck up so that their noses looked as if they were perpetually bleeding.  If your skin is not lily white and you can relate three or four generations back to plantation owners Mama Belle and Uncle Jim Bob, you are not blue-blooded enough tobe their friend.

I happen to be a double or triple minority and thelastthing I need is for some man dressed in a bedsheet to come knocking on my door just because my last name is not Johnson, Jones, Claggett, Richards or similar.  \n\nKentucky may not be the best, but neither is Tennessee.  If I had a choice I'd rather stay put than attempt to live in either."
2,"In which of the following airways does gas exchange occur? respiratory bronchiole or terminal bronchiole?

Sure the alveoli are the site of gas exchange.  What some of the answerers don't know is that alveoli are also associated with the alveolar duct and respiratory bronchiole.\n\nThe term ""terminal bronchiole"" is kind of a misnomer because they are not the last bronchiole;  just the last purely conducting bronchiole.  They diverge into respiratory bronchioles which are part conducting, and part gas exchange (because of their interspersed attached alveoli).  These diverge into alveolar ducts and alveoli which are purely gas exchange."

I love my family, but family gatherings stress me out.  I found a good excuse not to attend the family gathering and stayed home and made a nice turkey dinner and spent the day with my house mate and 2 dogs and did some buds and relaxed.  Slept like a baby all night.  LOL!!!!!
Yep, spent the day with my mother in law (she stayed long enough to eat, take the kids for a walk then she left) The rest of the day was with my husband and kids."

3,"question about sleep apnea?
I have sleep apnea.  I wake up at least 10 times a night (that I know of)when the back of my throat closes up and I cant breath. Im spacey during the day and have a constant headache.  Ive been prone to depression/anxiety in the past, and to make matters worse....i freak out when I jerk out of a dead sleep when I cant breath and it starts a panic attack.  I called my doctor, but he cant see me for 2 weeks.  Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this until I can make it to my appointment?  Im scared.
First of all I am 61 years old I have sleep apnea  and until two years ago I did not get any treatment.  So you are very lucky that you will be receiving treatment at a much younger age because I feel so very much better now .  \n\nI thought I was perfectly A OK until sleep apnea was diagnosed in a most unusual manner.... rather dramatic to me!  See I had a real simple operation in a hospital and was under anesthesia when I simply kinda like stopped breathing like they call DEAD LIKE ... thus was discovered formally the fact that I had central sleep apnea!  They like told my wife this and my tail was in a SLEEP LAB within the month for a overnight session where I stopped breathing 20 times while I was in what is called the REM level of sleep.  There are levels of sleep all the body gets sleep but the brain only sleeps on the last level level six called REM for rapid eye movement because our eyes dart around during this time.\n\nIt works like this when our brain takes a brake and goes into this level our body is on automatic.  It is operated by the lower brain stem.  Now if breathing is blocked of or if it stops the carbon dioxide builds up and the oxygen goes away in the blood in the brain!  This triggers the brain to drop out of REM and signal the lungs to gasp for air!  Now if a person was out on drugs or alcohol the brain could not signal the lungs and the person would simply not ever breath and DIE!  Cause of death sleep apnea!  Sleep apnea does not usually wake up a person.  Usually it just wakes up your brain a little bit and you do not normally realize it ever happened!  Most people just get up in the morning and are tired or have headaches or have to have an afternoon nap!  They do not realize what is wrong,  this is how my was!\n\nYou should look in the phone book for a Sleep Clinic rather than a regular doctor!  Your doctor will only send you to one anyway!  They will in an overnight session find the exact thing that is happening!  There is a fancy name it is called a polysomonograph they measure your breathing, brain pattern, pulse, eye movement, leg movement  and they take a movie of you sleeping. That is who you should contact the doctor connected with one of those clinics.  You can go to them without a referal!\n\n\nEverything will be just fine but you do need to go to a Sleep Study\n\nRelax you will be fine I made it for 59 years but they were miserable compaired to how it could of been!\n\nTry to go to a Clinic Directly Please! \n\n\nAPS"

It's the human race, not the black, white or latin race? does anyone else notice that? Or are we all just taking the easy way out so people are pointed out and described easior? Just curious, dont make this too heavy.
There is no such thing as race. There was a study done on human DNA, within the last ten years anyway, typing and comparing the DNA of people of many different ""racial"" backgrounds. Of course all the Asians expected to be genetically closer to Asians than anyone else, but it actually turned out that one Asian girl was closest genetically to her black male classmate. We are really very much alike under our skin.\nHumans are the closest to each other genetically. It's amazing. There can be as little as one nucleotide difference that distinguishes your DNA from mine.\nYou're totally right. People is people."

7,"How can I get more traffic on my website, Whimsical Cottage Soaps?

""If you build it, they will come"" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\n6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article ""10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm for tips on how to improve your conversion rates."

2,"Why is it raining a lot in the northeast?
Why is it raing hard alot in the northeast this week? Is it because of global warming?
Could be related to it in some indirect way. Many people seem to assume that if the globe warms that will mean hot & dry weather - desertlike conditions. Yet increasing CO2 may make vegetation more abundant - warmer weather causing more evaporation and probably more rain. So the NE may more begin to resemble a rain forest during summer.\n\nThe reason it has been raining alot recently though is persistent SE-S flow around an Atlantic surface High and a mid-tropospheric trof to the E. Warm & moist air flows inland and is lifted by the terrain, and conditions are favorable to support ascending air ahead of the upper trof.\n\nA High over the Atlantic is a persistent feature during summer. If it is far enough S, a large surface ridge builds over the SE U.S. from it and hot & dry SW-W winds occur over the NE. If it is further N though, that becomes a S-SE wind - an onshore flow which contributes to persistent and locally heavy rains."

That is the English translation, \n\nI don't have my concordance with me, but you should look up the Hebrew and Greek meanings.\n\nTo my understanding the word fear is relative to the nature of God and what is capable of. \n\nIts not a type of fear that you would have with evil or danger. \nIts more of a Lord I love you and I am afraid to hurt you as you are the ONE who made me and I do not want to hurt you.\n\n\nWe must love God with all our hearts, mind and soul.\n\n\nI hope this helps:))"

1,"Do you think Americans really understand how much our views of other countries are shaped by content on tv?
I believe that television has become the main conduit through which people in America learn about the world, which is not only sad but scary since most Americans have never been to other countries or sought to find out about other cultures firsthand or by doing any real research.  Americans seem to accept whatever is on the news as gospel.
I came here in 2002 to go to school I should be out of here by 2010.. I'm praying sooner. \nWhat I have learnt about the people of this country so far is that several of them tend to hold the view that other countries have nothing to offer, nothing of value and that they are the best there is. A view I do not personally subscribe to.\nI have met several Americans who have visited other countries but have not attempted to just see the country as is. Instead they have somehow stretched and twisted the country to fit into their preconceived mold of what the country is or should be.\nSo yes the view of members of this country is shaped by what is seen on television but it depends greatly on them. It is a choice. You can choose to find the truth if you so desire or to accept whatever is given to you. \nBesides the US isn't the only one with this problem, it just appears a bit worse here.\nSome people who read this may think I've no right to say what I have said. Well that's your opinion. This is mine."
3,"Is it not selfish to demand others stay alive, and not commit suicide?
People say it's selfish to commit suicide. What about not letting go of those who wish to let go?
I understand what your point is, but I also think that when a person is going through ideas of suicide, the person's judgment is not at its best at all.  It may seem like a solution to problems at that moment, but when a person goes into that mindframe, it is good for another person to help take over and not let something bad happen.\nA friend of mine killed herself by hanging herself. She must have felt there was no way she could deal with her life or be happy. I would not want my friends to live that way, but I also think that dark moods will pass and there will come other things and chances in life to bring more happiness. My friend will never know what those things could have been. I don't know if I'd call her ""selfish"" for killing herself. But I don't think she chose the best way to handle her grief."

A 6"" Newtonian is an excellent starter scope.  If you can get a clock drive to go with it, you'll have countless hours of entertainment.  That kind of scope has all the power you will need to see some of the more spectacular deep sky objects as well as all of the planets.  You'll be able to see four of the moons of Jupiter and the colored bands and even the great red spot on occasion.  You'll see the rings of Saturn quite well and possibly even the Cassini Division and Titan.\nYou'll be able to see Uranus and Neptune, but I doubt you will see any features.\nFor deep space, start out with the nebula in Orion and M31.  There are some nice open clusters in Cancer (the bee hive) and then you can move on to globulars like M3 and M13.  You'll be able to see binaries like Alberio and Cor Caroli (my personal fav) and even the Ring Nebula in Lyra without any problems whatsoever.  \nGood Choice for a beginner's scope."
2,"the history of sine wave, who invented it?

Sine Wave\nAn geometric waveform that oscillates (moves up, down or side-to-side) periodically, and is defined by the function y = sin x. In other words, it is an s-shaped, smooth wave that oscillates above and below zero.\n\nInvestopedia Says: The Composite Index of Lagging Indicators, one of three Business Cycle Indicators published by the Conference Board is known to resemble a sine wave since the measures that make up the index (i.e. ratios and interest rates) tend to oscillate between a range of values. For example, inflation is always kept between specified rates and if/once inflation meets or exceeds a specified limit, interest rates will be adjusted to either increase or decrease inflation so it is brought within a target range. Thus, as the rate of inflation increases, decreases or stays the same, interest rates will oscillate up and down to control an undesired rate of inflation."

It started innocently enough. I go to workout at my workplace's gym and when I go to take a shower there she is, cleaning out one of the bathroom stalls. I have time constraints to work with so I was unable to wait for her to finish. I started to undress so that I could take a shower and she surprised me by walking out at the perfect (unperfect?) time to catch me in my undies. She didn't even flinch and stuck around a while later. After that I see her almost regularly and I have this intense fixation on trying to expose myself to her. I work late hours so we are always alone. She has only left the room once, when I was wearing just a towel and hopped into the shower. Other than that she doesn't seem to mind if she were to catch me nude. She speaks only spanish so its not like I can talk to her. I wonder if that explains why I feel this weird urge.

Infinity is a concept most of us either don't try to understand or one we barely understand.

I am no closer to understanding or answering it than I was then.\nOh, once you have explained infinity to me, then please explain how it could possibly exist in any sort of rational form without God.
The place we call 'space' is very much 'infinite'? To understand it can't be done. Logically and or by dictionary terms it means boundless, endless or very great. Their are many ways to describe the word infinite because the word holds a question of uncertainty. So people try to answer the best they can because really, deep down we don't know the true answer. And all things not labled, catargorized or can easily be explained is scary and is alien to us. The unkown is a scary place for most. Whats after infinite? How can something possibly go on and on with no end. I was once told ""Their are new things that are being discovered every day because we as humans where meant to discover them, but then there are things that are so big and boundless that are mind can't even comprehend and thats because the answer lies with god and we will never know. You will drive your self crazy trying to understand the true concept of infinite. But remember this, the most intelligent scientists in the world can only answer your question with a text book answer with a scientific veiw point and still not answer your question completly.\n\nTo answer your second question. God can't be explained you have to discover him for your self and only then will you be able to discribe him. He is so unique that one word can't possibly sum him up.

Most important thing is to learn to deal with stress. We have a lot of emotional stress and if you want to get better you have to drop some tons of emotional baggage.

Rain, Wind, Tempature, Lightning and other weather related information\n   Available technologies of the present day lightning detectors include: \n\na. Radio Frequency (RF) Detectors. These measure energy discharges from lightning.  They can determine the approximate distance and direction of the threat.  \n\nb. Inferometers. These are multi-station devices, much more costly than RF detectors. They measure lightning strike data more precisely. Usually they require a skilled operator.\n\n\nd. Atmospheric Field  Mill Monitors. These measure the potential gradient (voltage) changes of the earth's electric field and report changes as thresholds build to lightning breakdown values.  \n\ne. e. Optical Monitors. These can provide earlier warning as they detect cloud-to-     cloud lightning that typically precedes cloud-to-ground lightning."
1,"If God is within an idol, and is within everything, then is he also in bad things?
like manure?  I'm trying to understand idol-worship practices of my gf without asking her, because I don't want to ruffle feathers.
“In India, in particular, a symbolic image represents one or another of the ‘divine attributes’, which is called pratika, for it is neither an ‘idol’, nor does it take on any qualities from that thing which it really is, an aid to meditation and a supplementary means toward realization"".\n                   -René Guénon (1886-1951)\n\nHuston Smith has said: "" It is obtuse to confuse Hinduism’s images with idolatry, and their multiplicity with polytheism. They are 'runways' from which the sense-laden human spirit can rise for its ""flight of the alone to the Alone"". Even village priest will frequently open their temple ceremonies with the following beloved invocation:\n\n   O Lord, forgive three sins that are due to my human limitations:\n   Thou art everywhere, but I worship you here;\n   Thou art without form, but I worship you in these forms;\n   Thou needest no praise, yet I offer you these prayers and salutations,\n   Lord, forgive three sins that are due to my human limitations.    \n\n(source: The World's Religions - By Huston Smith p. 34).\n\nDiane L. Eck observes: ""Hinduism is an imaginative, an ""image-making, religious tradition in which the sacred is seen   as present in the visible world – the world we see in multiple images and deities, in sacred  places, and in people. The notion of darsan call attention as students of Hinduism, to the fact that India is a visual and visionary culture. God is eminently visible, although human beings have not always had the refinement of sight to see. Furthermore, the divine is visible not only in temple and shrine, bit also in the whole continuum of life – in nature, in people, in birth and growth and death.\n\nIts all together wrong to think that the images are idols as though the statue itself is being worshipped – they are reminders that the God who dwells in the depth of our souls. Wherever an alter is raised, there is the center of the universe. The world’s axis passes through it, yet no visible alter is no more than a symbol for the one time alter – the human heart and to say the cosmic axis pierces it is to say that it is in direct touch with the infinite. \n\n\nBy the way on what basis western religions including Islam believes god made man in it own image? hinduism declares god has no form so he is every form. but they seem to think god looks like humans .\n\nAdded:\n\n someone  below is trying to convert you now thats funny. \n\njust wanted to tell him i find that story of moses plus other stories too primitive. ya ya heard about him. the man who claimed god gave him messeges. i wonder why god was so shy that he talked to moses only. Why did god not address everybody.  why idolise  dead persons and indulge in social idolatery when you claim to be agaist idols.."
7,"Should I be recieving overtime pay?
I am a in home caregiver and I HAVE to work 48-84 hrs. a week, there is only 2 of us and I was told sence I was privare care I wasn't intitled to overtime.
Employers are required to pay overtime in most cases.  There may be exceptions to this if you are working 24-hour shifts where you're allowed to sleep during the night . . . at which point they can legally pay you for 16 hours of sleep, as long as they providing your room and board at no cost during your work time.  \n\nSince this can vary slightly from state to state, the best advice I could give you is to call your department of labor, and ask them.  If you don't want to open a can of worms where your employer finds out and is upset, ask them the same question anonomously.  \n\nThe other question I would ask is, regardless of the answer, is this work you're happy doing?  The ""red flag"" that jumps out at me in all this is whether you will end up burning out if you are workng that many hours, particularly if you are routinely working in excess of 50 hours.  What are you doing to take care of yourself, because you can't effectively take care of others, if you're not taking care of yourself.  \n\nTake it from someone who knows . . . both from experience and as soon who works in the same field as a Human Resources Director for a homecare agency.  \n\nBest of luck."

I live in Northern California, and it was rainy and very cold in my part of town. The muscles in my arms and legs were really hurting.\n\nI'm in my mid 40's and though I feel young at heart, my body occasionally feels the effects of getting older and I'm wondering, can an older person like myself experience achy muscles from cold weather? I don't remember feeling this way in my 20's and 30's.

3,"My friend is jelous when other people have more money or stuff.?
She talks fequently about who has a nice car, and doesn't work hard because the husband has money.  And who's kids get spoiled on holidays.  I admire my friend for being a stay home mom and taking care of her handicapped child.  She doesn't trust putting her child in a home.  She gets social security to help support her daughter.  What do I say so she doesn't get jelous?  Something tactful, as she's a good friend.
It sounds like she has a hard life.\nYou can't change her jealous nature.\nIt is actually envy of what others have.\nOne of the things  you have to learn is that you can't change other people. Tell her that what other people have has nothing to do with her life. Tell her how lucky she is to have what ever she has. Other people may wish they had what she has."
3,"Responses on Double-Jaw Surgery?
Anybody 'victim' of the double-jaw surgery that would warn me what I am in for? For those who don't know...double-jaw surgery is where they break your upper and lower jaw and fix them making a normal bite. I have a difference of 5mm but you wouldn't be able to notice (mostly an underbite).
My honest opinion for you is that it is going to suck for a bit.  You will have discomfort at first usually well controlled with pain medications.  You will also have to be wired shut for a few weeks (usually for about 6 weeks) where you will have to consume mostly a liquid diet.  Afterward, your muscles will be sore and tight. BUT, I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL ALL BE WORTH IT IN THE END!!!!!  I have seen and been part of a few of these cases and actually had a friend who had it done about a year ago and everyone that I have asked, would do it again in a heartbeat!  Hope that this proves helpful, good luck with it!"
3,"Is it better to aim for 1/2 pound or 1 pound weight loss weekly for permanent weight loss?
I'm concerned that by limiting my calorie intake too much i will be depriving my body of certain nutrients.  what does the doctor usually recommend?
You can also lose one pound a week\n\n\n\nThe majority of fitness professionals advise slow weight loss as the safest and most helpful approach. A sensible weight-loss program allows you to lose weight slowly -- about one-half to one pound per week. Slow weight loss promotes long-term loss of body fat, not just water weight that can be rapidly regained.\n\nMost people need around 15 calories per pound to maintain their weight. A person of 150 pound would not eat food that contains calories more than 2250 per day in order to maintain his/her weight.\n\nIn order to burn one pound, a person need to burn 3500 calories more than they are used. For example, dropping calories by 300 per day and increasing daily movement to burn off an extra 200 calories should result in a weight loss of one pound a week."

Well, sorta:\n\nVaginal flatulence (flatus vaginalis in Latin) is an emission, or expulsion of air from the vagina, often during or after sexual intercourse or (less often) cunnilingus or an*al sex. The sound is somewhat comparable to flatulence from the an*us, but does not involve waste gasses, and thus has no associated odor."
2,"Koch's postulates exceptions on healthy suceptible host not getting infected when inoculated with bacteria
why, in some cases, an healthy but suceptible host don't get infected when it is inoculated with the causing agent of a dicease?
The previous presence of the bacteria causes the body to produce an antibody for the particular bacteria and increases immunity to later infections by the same non-mutated bacteria."
3,"What are the types of heart attacks?

When most people say ""heart attack,"" they mean an MI -- myocardial infarction.  This is usually caused when a plaque in one of the heart's blood vessels ruptures and blocks the vessel.  The heart muscle supplied by this vessel starves from lack of oxygen.  If the clot is not eliminated in eight hours or so, most of the heart muscle in that region is irreversably damaged.  Survival after a heart attack depends on how long it takes to get treatment, and how much of the heart muscle is affected.  \n\nAnother kind of ""heart attack"" could be an arrhythmia -- the heart suddenly starts beating abnormally and is unable to sustain circulation.  You may have heard people being ""scared to death.""  Although this is very rare, it probably refers to the heart going into an arrhythmia called pulseless ventricular tachycardia."
7,"What causes variation of the value of the dollar in terms of rate of exchange with other currencies?

From Wikipedia (there is much more at the link I provided):\n\n""A market based exchange rate will change whenever the values of either of the two component currencies change. A currency will tend to become more valuable whenever demand for it is greater than the available supply. It will become less valuable whenever demand is less than available supply (this does not mean people no longer want money, it just means they prefer holding their wealth in some other form, possibly another currency).""\n\n""Increased demand for a currency is due to either an increased transaction demand for money, or an increased speculative demand for money.""\n\n""A currency will tend to lose value, relative to other currencies, if the country's level of inflation is relatively higher, if the country's level of output is expected to decline, or if a country is troubled by political uncertainty."""

2,"Do I get wetter if I run or if I walk in the rain?

Don't listen to any of the other answers because as odd as it may seem the truth is \n\nIT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WETHER YOU WALK OR RUN in the rain\nbecause The empirical evidence presented notwithstanding, it seems implausible that the number of raindrops hitting a person per unit time remains constant whether running or walking. The answer posits that running will cause you to hit more raindrops on the front per second, with which I agree, but claims that you will be hit less often on the top, with which I disagree on the following grounds: \n\nAs a horizontal piece of cardboard moves forward, drops that would have hit it go behind it and thus miss. However one would expect an equal number of raindrops that would have fallen in front of the cardboard to now hit. \n\nTherefore taking front and top into account, running should cause you to intersect more drops per second than walking, but will take less time to cover a certain distance. How these 2 effects balance out remains to be seen. \n\nMathematical models which assume raindrops falling vertically in planes with randomly distributed drops within the plane show the two effects to balance out perfectly, but the real life application?

2,"Relate the jet stream to upper air circulation.  How does this circulation pattern relate to airline schedules

When planes fly west to east, they can often go into the jet stream, which can add 100 or more miles per hour to their speed.  When flying in the other direction, they must fight this wind.  At the very least, they can fly above or below it, which reduces its effect, but they still have a ground speed of less than planes flying the other direction that can use the jet stream's assist.\n\nIt's the difference between trying to row a boat upstream vs. downstream."

3,"Under chin Liposuction...Anyone Had It??  I've got a couple of questions.?
Good morning.  Has anyone had under the chin liposuction or any type of plastic surgery to have a double chin removed?  I am not overweight at all, but this is something that I find very troubling. I know it is something I've inherited from my mother's side...my grandmother's eventually was hanging and now my mother's it starting to do that, and my sister and my female cousin has the double chin as do I.  I think it ages my look and I'm ready to do something about it.  Any experience or if any of you know anyone who's had it done, I would appreciate any information you can provide, especially things like cost, down time, how long it took to heal and if your were pleased with the outcome.  Thanks in advance!
I can understand why this bothers you - many of my relatives and siblings have the same problem. And same as you, they're all pretty trim, but they just have this extra skin under their chin that bothers them. I've done some research on it on their behalf - I do think it's a smart preventative measure. It would make you feel better now, of course, but also help keep later sagging to a minimum.\n\nAnyway, I think what you're considering is a neck-lift...it lifts the saggy layers of skin just under your chin and gives you better definition at the base of your face. I'm sure you've found that plastic surgery costs vary based on where you live, but I've found the range to be from around $6,000, up to $10,000. This probably will depend on various fees (operating room, anesthesia...), but also on how much ""work"" you're having done. Recovery doesn't sound too bad - the day or two after are probably the toughest, as you wear a neck brace, and there's probably a week or two of total ""downtime."" When you start consulting with doctors, they'll obviously have details, and most will be able to get you touch with a previous patient so you can hear about their experience.\n\nI'm including a good website I found below, hopefully that'll help you learn more. Good luck to you! I definitely think this is a valuable procedure."
2,"why is that speed of light is independent of the frame of reference ?????

The previous answer is wrong. There is absolutely nothing stopping your reference frame travelling near (or even at) the speed of light. Even if you were travelling at 0.999999% the speed of light, you would still observe a light beam travelling past you at c. This speed is a constant because the speed of light does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting the radiation (see Maxwells equations)."

Help! I am so confused and worried! I haven't started my period yet(at all, I am a late starter) but I have been getting really heavy white (I am not sure what its called, I think it is reffered to as discharge) So I decided to wear panty liners because my underwear got sticky at school. But I am not sure I am putting it on right. It's so uncomfortable, I tried to cut it and make it smaller but that didn't help. Is it always this unconfortable, what about pads, they would be worse, I couldn't deal with that all day! I tried talking to my mom but she was really vague and unhelpful. She says that pads are always unconfortable and that they dont help the sticky ness! Is it true, I couldn;t deal with that its so bad! I am really upset and confused please help!
If the discharge is soaking through to your pants, then it might be too much.  Having a lot of discharge before you get your first period is normal - the discharge is just lubrication, like tears for your eyes or wax for your ears.  \nIt's odd that the pantyliners would be uncomfortable - they are pretty thin and I don't even notice that they are there.  Pads are bulkier and take some getting used to.  Go back to the store and make sure you are buying the smallest liners and pads available - I started out borrowing my mother's, which were HUGE in comparison and were awkward on my tiny frame.\nYes, you will always feel a bit ""sticky"" between your body and the pad/liner, just like a bandaid and a fresh wound.  It gets better, and you learn how to carry your body in a way that minimizes the awkwardness and spotting.  I do it subconsciously now, but I can remember that it felt awkward and unnatural when I was starting out. Just keep experimenting and practising - it will get easier, I promise.\n\nPlease be careful about using tampons - sticking one of those in yourself may prove to be the most uncomfortable option of all!  Also, leaving a tampon in too long or forgetting to take one out can cause toxic shock syndrome - my friend is an ER doctor and tells some very scary stories about TSS!"
3,"If I go to the doctor and tell them I'm wanting to lose some weight, what will they say or tell me to do?
I need to lose about 85 pounds...
He will check to see if your weight problem is medically related? (i.e. thyroid or something else) a medicine you are taking? menopause (if that is your age? In other words, he/she will first determine that your weight gain is not caused by a medical problem. \n\nOnce they determine it is not; then they will discuss diffrent options with you (and it will depend on your insurance/personal needs/willpower - in other words it is TERRIBLY important that you be super honest with the doctor - prepare for that appointment by taking with you start an honest/down to earth log of your daily intake (don't count calories,etc...just write it down).  The log should include, at a minimum, date/time of day, what you eat/drink (how much) - snacks - candy - gum - smoke- exercise if you don't, then go ahead and write it down!  Doctor cannot discuss options with you on how to solve this problem if he doesn't understand your lifestyle.  \n\nOptions could be anything from: prescribing meds to help you reduce weight and watch you closely - especially if you are so overweight that it could lead to heart disease or diabetes.....if the overweight is not bad, then he would refer you to a Dietician and/or nutritionist and recommend increased activity --- starting you off slow and easy -- maybe even low impact, like pool aerobics, walking, etc.\n\nYou are wise to want to go to the doctor to help you.  Weight gain is not just because of lifestyle...so need to know it isn't something else."
1,"I read where muslims want to divide christians?
That's why you see so many discreding remarks about morman, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists and other Christian faiths, including catholics.  The idea is to divide and conquer.  It said that the christians fight all the time, turn them against each other.\nfLike in Ireland prostants and Catholics.  Don't let them do it.\nLet's stop tearing each others christian faith down.
The real enemy of God and man is Satan the Devil, although it is true that false religion is a favorite tool used by Satan...\n\n(1 Peter 5:8-10) Keep YOUR senses, be watchful. YOUR adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour [someone]. 9 But take YOUR stand against him, solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of YOUR brothers in the world. 10 But, after YOU have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved kindness, who called YOU to his everlasting glory in union with Christ, will himself finish YOUR training, he will make YOU firm, he will make YOU strong\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:3-4) If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 4 among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through"

i dont bruise....at all. like , i wrestle with my brother and i feel bad because he comes out black and blue and i wont have anything to prove that he  can throw a punch!
im not sure what would be the cause and no its not really normal but not all abnormalities are bad, you may simply have thicker walled blood cells and they arent breaking. I bruise so easily that i seldom know what caused the bruising. you can always look it up on the net, just put into search engines  bruising and once you find some sites put in the info that you dont bruise and it might answer something for you.  You also may be in better health than your brother. I wouldnt worry about a lack of bruises, but i would worry about the bruises you are causing, your brother may or may not be ill but its best not to fight so much if hes getting bruised a lot."
2,"do humans mutate throughout their life if so does cloning of an adult cause rapid mutation of the embryo?

I disagree with Cobra.  Cloning an old human being will not result in advanced aging in the clone.  Remember dolly, the cloned sheep?  At first, scientists thought that she would age much faster than a regular sheep.  This, however, was not the case.\n\nAnd, since the clipping of telomeres (that change in your genes that Cobra was talking about) is the only change that occurs in the genes during the life of a human (barring radioactive exposure), cloning a 100-year-old human would have the same result as cloning the same human when he or she is an infant.  No difference, no additional mutation.\n\nFor info about dolly's aging, see the below article under ""Controversy."""
2,"discuss the role of the kidney in maintaining acid-base balance.?

I am not an expert on this topic so here is a quotation:\n""Your body's cells use chemical reactions to carry out tasks such as turning food into energy and repairing tissue. These chemical reactions generate acids. But too much acid in the blood—acidosis—can disturb many bodily functions. Healthy kidneys help maintain acid-base balance by excreting acids into the urine and returning bicarbonate—an alkaline, or base, substance—to the blood. This ""reclaimed"" bicarbonate neutralizes much of the acid that is created when food is broken down in the body. \n\nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine, which causes a person's blood to remain too acidic. Without proper treatment, chronic acidity of the blood leads to growth retardation, kidney stones, bone disease, and progressive renal failure"""
1,"when and how do i join a sorority?
i would like to get to know people more quickly and be part of a group. when do you join a college sorority and how?
The process of joining a fraternity or sorority is commonly referred to as ""pledging"" or ""rushing."" The term ""rush"" refers to the historical practice where students would hurry to join fraternities at the beginning of the school year in large part to find housing.\n\nRecruitment is done formally or informally. The traditional ""formal recruitment"" often consists of a period known as ""Rush"" or ""Rush Week."" Fraternities and sororities invite fellow students (often referred to as ""rushees"" or ""potential new members"") to attend events at the house (or on-campus) and meet the current members of the organization. These formal rush weeks may impose limits on contact between interested students and active members to ensure fairness, such as time requirements to visit each house. ""Informal recruitment"" as the name suggests, is much less structured. New members are introduced to the fraternity's members and activities through friends and everyday behavior. Many campuses may have formal recruitment periods and also allow informal recruitment after the formal period ends. ""Deferred recruitment"" refers to systems where students must have at least one semester's experience on campus before joining.\n\nYou may have to meet certain criteria to join such as grade point average. Before being sworn in you are known as a pledge and have fewer rights than full members."
2,"Why can't we remember things that happen to us when we were babies?
I vaguely remember that there are long term and short term memories. If there are emphasis on short term memories (e.g we think about it again), it might then be stored as long term memories. But why can't we remember anything from when we were very young?
Thats a very interesting question, and has been addressed at least to some point-It's clear, though we don't conciously remember events, that we do learn a great deal during this time, thus we ""remember' a huge amount- the process of walking, controlling your limbs, facial expressions, on and on and on, are all learned and remembered event from infanthood- What we don't seem to remember are events per se- It appears as if that portion of our learning is developmentally controlled, such that the limbic system filters much of the detail out in infancy- only later, when high-level socialization occurs, does the limbic system start to recognize details and allow them to reach long-term memory. Essentially, the brain and learning are very very tightly developmentally controlled, so that certain things are learned at certain times- biologically, the brain is wired such that the most critical learning, such as how to control the body, how to interact in the most general way with people, etc, are learned first, and everything else is weeded out.  It's probably critical that this occurs, else we would remember being a baby at the expense of not learning how to walk until we were in Junior high!\nJust to address some things that were said before-we have an excellent memory as infants, and learn extremely quickly, but it is wired in a different way- There is also no evidence that events are stored at all, and thus no evidence that any of the infant memories can be ""recovered"" because they were not laid down to begin with."
1,"How come I want to be saved but everytime I try and pray I dont feel like I am saved?

Being saved isn't a ""feeling"" it's trusting in the truth contained in God's Word. Have you walked the Roman Road?\n\nThe ROMANS ROAD....is a pathway you can walk.\n\nIt is a group of Bible verses from the book of Romans in the New Testament. If you walk down this road you will end up understanding how to be saved. \n\nRomans 3:23 ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.""\n\nWe all have sin in our hearts. We all were born with sin. \n\nWe were born under the power of sin's control.\n\n- Admit that you are a sinner.\n\n\n\nRomans 6:23a ""...The wages of sin is death..."" \n\nSin has an ending. It results in death. We all face physical death, which is a result of sin. But a worse death is spiritual death that alienates us from God, and will last for all eternity. The Bible teaches that there is a place called the Lake of Fire where lost people will be in torment forever. It is the place where people who are spiritually dead will remain.\n\n- Understand that you deserve death for your sin.\n\nRomans 6:23b ""...But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" \n\nSalvation is a free gift from God to you! You can't earn this gift, but you must reach out and receive it.\n\n- Ask God to forgive you and save you.\n\nRomans 5:8, ""God demonstrates His own love for us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us!""\n\nWhen Jesus died on the cross He paid sin's penalty. He paid the price for all sin, and when He took all the sins of the world on Himself on the cross, He bought us out of slavery to sin and death! The only condition is that we believe in Him and what He has done for us, understanding that we are now joined with Him, and that He is our life. He did all this because He loved us and gave Himself for us!\n\n- Give your life to God... His love poured out in Jesus on the cross is your only hope to have forgiveness and change. His love bought you out of being a slave to sin. His love is what saves you -- not religion, or church membership. God loves you!\n\nRomans 10:13 ""Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved!"" \n\n- Call out to God in the name of Jesus!\n\nRomans 10:9,10 ""...If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.""\n\n- If you know that God is knocking on your heart's door, ask Him to come into your heart. \n\nJesus said,\n\nRevelation 3:20a ""Behold I stand at the door and knock, if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him..."" \n\n- Is Jesus knocking on your heart's door?\n\nBelieve in Him. Ask Him to come in to your heart by faith,\nand ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Open the Bible to the Gospel of John and read what God says about Jesus, about you, and about being born again. \n\nGod will help you. He loves you. \n\nYou need to look for a local church where God's word is preached. The Bible says that we are to desire God's word like a newborn baby desires mother's milk.\n\nAren't you hungry to know the truth?\n\nWater baptism is one of the ways you first show that you have been joined to Jesus. This is an action, and actions will not save you. However, it is an act of obedience and a symbol of commitment.\n\nThe symbolism is this: When you go down in the water you show that You have been crucified and buried with Him,\n\nAnd when you come up out of the water you show that you have been raised to walk with Him in newness of life. \n\n(See Romans chapter 6)\n\nYou have been born again. \n\n(See John chapter 3)\n\nYour body has become God's temple. Your heart is where He lives. Forgiveness is yours in Jesus. And you belong to Him.\n\nYou were sin's slave.\n\nBut now...\n\nYou are a child of GOD!\n\nJohn 1:12 &quot"

7,"Texas Accountants! What are the differences in taxes for an LLC and a C Corp?
Assume a small company.  2-4 Employees.  The business will make less than $100k each year.  Likely between $30k - $90k.  No double taxation on the C Corp, we'll take the money out via salaries.\n\nBut what about the franchise tax?  And what other differences should we be aware of?
I'm not an accountant, but I have a corporation in Texas.  Either way, it's expensive and you're going to spend several hundred dollars, so if your business doesn't have much liability now, you may want to wait and just file a DBA as a partnership.\n\nFor either of them, you need to file with the Secretary of State, here's the link, it'll tell you how to file, fees, etc.\nhttp://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/businessstructure.shtml\n\nWith your size business, if you go as a corporation, you should elect to be an ""S"" corp.  This is very easy and lets you pass any profits from the corporation to the shareholders as wages.  Any losses are passed to the shareholders and you deduct from you personal taxes.  The corporation files a year end tax form, and K-1 showing the percentages for each shareholder.  You then file a supplement page with your 1040.  \n\nThe main difference with the LLC I think is record keeping.  If you're a corporation, you need to have annual meetings, keep articles of incorporation, detailed records of any changes.  Costs are about the same.   I forget the filing fee, but I think it's like $400 to register the name and paperwork.  You don't need a lawyer if you can find the paperwork that'll show you what you need.\n\nFranchise tax is nothing to worry about.  As a corp in Texas, you need to file 2 forms with the state every tax year.  One just shows the names of the directors and the other is your income; but if it's less than $250,000, you don't owe anything."

1,"Anybody heard of the Atlantis Ring? Share your experiences if you have any?

Its story started eight thousand years ago, when the Atlantis left their great knowledge to some of the Egyptian priest.It was founded by HOWARD CARTER, Egyptologist, in the Kings Valley, inside the priest JUAH''S grave. Later CARTER was the only one who escaped alive from the TUTANCAMON anathema's that was write in the front of his grave: “the death will take with its wings that who disturb Pharaoh sleep's”. When all the others scientists that had penetrated in his grave died one after another of stangers diseases, then it was noticed that the only thing that make CARTER different from the others was the others was the fact that he was wearing the famous ATLANTIS RING, which left him stay alive.\n\nSince then numberless of researches became interested in the ring . They came to a conclusion that the power of the RING came from a kind of energetically wave called LUXOR; of which invisibles agents catalyses cosmically energy. \n\nMany sites sell what they call are exact copies of the original ring, but they are based on photographs from a book written by Roger de Lafforest.\n\nNowadays the ring is sold under different 'configurations': with two or four holes, with an inner geometrical figure or just a line, with six little triangles or six little squares, etc. ,etc.\n\nPersonally I don't know of a single person who is using this ring so I don't know if it really works or not. Probably I should give it a try but I also have read somewhere that the ring creates a state of dependence but I think is the kind of dependence that any talisman has on certain people."

my penis is about 5 3 /4 in long is that normal how long will it get
While there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.\n\nMen are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.\n\nThe truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.\n\nThe truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind – that can be LOTS of fun.\n\nThe truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl’s clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.\n\nBesides – a smaller penis is always easier to swallow than a bigger one."
7,"Who are the best Grant sources for a female owned and established company?

It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

if i do pilates 15 min. each day When do u think i will see results???
Essentially, you should probably change your routine to twenty minutes a day, four times a week.  You need to give your body time to warm up and let your heart rate pick up a bit.  Good for you for doing fifteen min. per day though!  When most people start a new exercise routine in conjunction with a good diet, you should begin to see slight results within three to four weeks.

I think companies hire them just to frustrate callers and make us stop calling for service."
2,"why there are 3 blades in a ceiling fan?

Look for blade sets which are balanced for stable operation. To prevent warping, blades should be sealed against seasonal moisture. Outdoor fan blades are constructed of a man-made material that won't warp under changes of humidity. Blade pitch ranges from 8 degrees to 15 degrees. The higher the pitch, the more air the fan circulates at slow speeds. The number of blades ranges from 3 to 5, but has little effect on the amount of air the fan moves.\n \nWhatever be the no. of blades , major cause of concerne is balancing of the blades.all blades should in the same plane and at the same angle."

Acts 19:13-16 19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received freely give;Mark 5: 1-20 Many Devils The Demoniac Healed Mark 5:2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.5:3 (Strong) Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man coudl bind him, no, no with chains; 5:4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; neither could any man tame him. 5:5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 5:6 But when he saw jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thous Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 5:8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name?And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 5:10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 5:11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 5:12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
yes. he's real.\n\nthe sad thing is that he tempts us so easily and we for the most part fall right into the trap. It is easier to give into temptation than to follow the path of righteousness. this is why most people claim to be atheist or claim to know Jesus, but yet do what he never did. they take the easy way out."

I have a 5mm Kidney Stone. Is there any chance it will come out pain free or will I cry like a bitch?
The discomfort of a kidney stone's passage - is most apparent when it passes from the ureter, into the bladder.  The ureter is the tube that carries urine from the kidney.  Passage through the urethra - tube that carries urine from the bladder to the toilet, tree, or alley wall, is often not noticed with a stone of this size - and when it is noticed.  The discomfort can be great in passing through the ureter and generally pain meds are prescribed to take as needed.  A stone that fails to pass in a reasonable amont of time, is accompanied by fever, chills, or uncontrolled pain, requires the attention of a Urologist.\n\nBest wishes - I hope you don't feel a thing and pass the stone with no trouble."

2,"How is kerosene made?

Kerosene is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum at 150 °C and 275 °C (carbon chains from the C12 to C15 range).\n\nTypically, kerosene directly distilled from crude oil requires some treatment, either in a Merox unit or a hydrotreater, to reduce its sulfur content and its corrosiveness. Kerosene can also be produced by a hydrocracker, which is used to upgrade the parts of crude oil that would otherwise only be good for fuel oil.\n\nKerosene was first refined from a naturally-occurring asphaltum called Albertite by Abraham Gesner in 1846, founding the modern petroleum industry in the process. Gesner went on to establish his Kerosene Gaslight Company to market kerosene around the world in 1850. Scottish chemist James Young built the first truly commercial oil-works in the world at Bathgate in 1851, using oil extracted from locally mined Torbanite, shale and bituminous coal. Polish chemist Ignacy Łukasiewicz discovered the means of refining kerosene from the less expensive seep oil in 1856. The widespread availability of cheaper kerosene was the principal factor in the precipitous decline in the whaling industry in the mid- to late 19th century, as the leading product of whaling was oil for lamps.\n\n\n[edit] Uses\nAt one time it was widely used in kerosene lamps and lanterns. These were superseded by the electric light bulb and flashlights powered by dry cell batteries. Now it is mainly used in fuel for jet engines (more technically Avtur, Jet-A, Jet-A1, Jet-B, JP-4, JP-5, JP-7 or JP-8). A form of kerosene known as RP-1 is burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications as to smoke points and freeze points.\n\nIn the early 1900's, kerosene was used as a cheap fuel for tractors. The engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. A ""heat valve"" on the manifold would route the exhaust gasses around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it can be ignited by a electrical spark.\n\nIts use as a cooking fuel is mostly restricted to some portable stoves for backpackers and to less developed countries, where it is usually less refined and contains impurities and even debris. It can also be used to remove lice from hair, but this practice is painful and potentially very dangerous.\n\nAs a heating fuel, it is often used in portable stoves, and is sold in some filling stations. It is sometimes used as a heat source during power failures. The use of portable kerosene heaters is not recommended for closed indoor areas without a chimney due to the danger of buildup of carbon monoxide gas.\n\nKerosene is widely used in Japan as a home heating fuel for portable and installed kerosene heaters. In Japan, kerosene can be readily bought at any filling station or be delivered to homes.\n\nThe Amish, who limit use of electric appliances for religious reasons, rely on kerosene for lighting and often purchase kerosene-powered versions of appliances such as refrigerators.\n\nIt is used as an organic solvent.\n\nKerosene is often used in the entertainment industry, as a fuel for fire dancing. Kerosene is not usually used as a fuel for indoor fire-dancing as it produces an unpleasant odour which becomes, in sufficient concentration, poisonous. In general such use of fire indoors is not common. Methanol is often used instead [citation needed], however it can be a more dangerous fuel because of its lower flash point, and it also produces less ""impressive"" flames.\n\nMore ubiquitous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, kerosene space heaters were often built into kitchen ranges and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter. At one time citrus growers used smudge pots fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove in an effort to prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops. ""Salamanders"" were kerosene space heaters used on construction sites to dry out"
3,"What is the best wayof obtaining good health?
In my opinion normal diet plus going to SALAH (Islamic prayer) five times daily regularly with full attention to AL-MIGHT GOD(ALLAH) IS THE BEST WAY OF HAVING GOOD HEALTH.\nFor non-muslims abstaining from all bad habits and things and ignoring all worries is the key to good health.
Good health in terms of a healthy body can be obtain with good nutrition. Unfortunately the food consumed today no longer have the nutrition it use to have. For the most part, food is processed and obtained at a local supermarket. Its not the same as the food back in our home lands. To acquire better health we must turn to supplementation.

i have this problem for past 4 years . what could be neural problem
get it checked NOW!! i have these same symptoms, and i have been diagnosed with a psuedo tumor. it goes like sideways/diagonal from the back of my neck, then straight over across to my left side. it always hurts, and doesn't seem to get better. it's just somehting i have to deal with the pain until it goes away. \nfor added help, i've given other causes & symptoms to headaches. i hopeyou can relate to something here & get this taken care of!\n\nThe most common types of headaches usually are not serious but may occur again and again.\n\n--Tension headaches -- the most common type of headache and are episodes of constant aching, tightness, pressure, and pain around the forehead, temples, or back of the head and neck. Symptoms usually occur on both sides of the head rather than just one side. \nTension headaches usually do not stop a person from doing his or her regular activities. These headaches usually do not cause nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. A tension headache can last anywhere from 30 minutes to several days. Some people experience chronic tension headaches, which means they get a headache on 15 or more days a month.\nTension headaches are related to muscles tightening in the back of the neck or head because of stress, anxiety, fatigue, hunger, anger, poor posture, or overexertion.\nTreatment for tension headaches usually includes aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonprescription pain relievers. Aspirin should not be given to anyone age 20 years or younger because it has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious disease that most often affects children. Prescription medications, such as antidepressants, may be needed to treat tension headaches. Additional therapies, including stress management or biofeedback, may reduce or prevent tension headaches\n \n--Cluster headaches -- these are recurring headaches that occur in groups or cycles. The headaches appear suddenly and cause severe, debilitating pain on one side of the head, along with a watery eye and nasal congestion on the affected side of the head. The cause of cluster headaches is unknown. Although there is no cure for cluster headaches, medications can reduce the frequency and duration of the painful headaches.\n--Migraine headaches -- Approximately one-third of people who have migraine headaches first began having them as teenagers. are painful, sometimes disabling headaches that are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. These throbbing headaches usually occur on only one side of the head, although the pain can shift from one side of the head to the other, or can occur on both sides at the same time. Migraines involve changes in chemicals and blood vessels in the brain, which trigger pain signals leading to headache and other symptoms.\nMigraine headaches tend to recur. A migraine headache typically lasts 4 to 24 hours but in some cases can last up to 3 days. Some people have symptoms, such as visual disturbances, that occur before a headache starts. These symptoms are called a migraine aura.\nSome people have several headaches per month; others have headaches much less often. Treatment usually includes medications to prevent a migraine from occurring or to stop a migraine once it begins. In some people, migraines may be triggered by certain foods or smells. Eliminating exposure to these triggers may stop the headaches.\n\nHere's a list of common causes of headaches include:\n\n--Alcohol, caffeine, or other drug use or withdrawal. \n--Changes in the levels of chemicals in the body (neurotransmitters). \n--Coughing or sneezing. \n--Dehydration. \n--Dental problems or procedures, such as pain from grinding the teeth or from a root canal. \n--Eating or drinking cold foods and fluids. \n--Emotional stress. \n--Exposure to smoke or fumes from chemicals, including carbon monoxide. \n--Eyestrain. \n--Fever. \n--High altitude. Lower oxygen levels at high altitudes can cause headaches."

1,"How is Christianity not a religion?
I am so tired of hearing that Christianity is not a religion...how is it not?\nThe definition of religion is ""Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe."" How does this not fit Christianity? \nThe Bible even says...""But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.  If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.  Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world"" James 1:25-27 so by say it is not a religion is going against the bible

2,"What is droop on an electrical grid?

Electrical power is a little bit like the air you breathe: You don't really think about it until it is missing. Power is just ""there,"" meeting your every need, constantly. It is only during a power failure, when you walk into a dark room and instinctively hit the useless light switch, that you realize how important power is in your daily life. You use it for heating, cooling, cooking, refrigeration, light, sound, computation, entertainment... Without it, life can get somewhat cumbersome. \n\nPower travels from the power plant to your house through an amazing system called the power distribution grid. \n\nThe grid is quite public -- if you live in a suburban or rural area, chances are it is right out in the open for all to see. It is so public, in fact, that you probably don't even notice it anymore. Your brain likely ignores all of the power lines because it has seen them so often. In this article, we will look at all of the equipment that brings electrical power to your home.

7,"Salary question asked too early during a phone interview?
When doing an initial or in-house interview, how do you answer the below kind of questions (which I happen to hate and even offends me).\n\n1) What is your expected salary? (When this question is asked as a VERY FIRST question by the interviewr during the VERY FIRST stage of interview/screening process.  Asking too much or too little can immediately screen you out especially the interviewer throws this kind of question before all other questions.)\n\n2) How much are you making at your current employment? (This makes me want to say, ""That's none of your business"", but clearly you can't say that to an interviewer unless you want to end a job interview which you have been waiting for weeks/months/or almost a year.)\n\nI've tried saying, ""I'd like to discuss other aspects of job first, and after that I'd be glad to discuss the salary issue"", but one this did not work.  The interviewer asked for my phone number, which she had from the resume she found online, and said she'll call me back to schedule an in-house interview after scheduling other interviews, but she never called back.
Honestly, how much you are making is NONE of their business.  You don't have to answer that.  As far as asking for salary .. skip it.  You should be more concerned with the work duties than the money in the first interview.  If this is a second or third, ask away!  Good luck!"
2,"why do we vomit if we smell something pungent?

Vomiting is supposed to expel dangerous stuffs from the stomach.\n\nSome evolutionary biologists believe that vomiting in response to odors is designed to prevent us from eating things that are bad for us.  For example, some carnivores can eat spoiled meat.  Humans can't.  The smell of spoiled meat makes us nauseated, and may even make us throw up so that we don't eat spoiled meat.  It may be an over-reaction.  We are supposed to feel sick to overcome any hunger pangs, but we go too far and throw up."
1,"Do you think Black women are stereotyped on reality TV programs?
I can name so many black women on reality tv who are very sterotypical and misrepresent us. Omarosa for the Appernitce, Jade from Top Model 6, Monique from Top Model 7, Camille from Top Model 2, New York/Hottie/Bootz from Flavor of Love, Coral from the Real World. Why are Black women being portrayed like this on television? We aren't like this.
I think we're portrayed like this on TV because we allow ourselves to be. We continue to feed the stereotype because the girls with the foulest attitudes seem to get the most attention. For example, you know the winner of Top Model 6, but who is the other name that's instantly recognizable? Jade. She stood out because of her ""stank"" attitude. You may not think you're as catty as the women on TV, but when you spend time in internet messageboards, at work, w/friends etc talking trash about the catty girl on TV, don't you think you're perpetuating the stereotype??\n\nOh, and educated doesn't mean good attitude. Sure, Omarosa's educated, but she acted like an uber-diva. She seemed to relish being the diva-biotch too. \n\nNot all of us act the way we see on TV, but if you notice, more and more of us (especially our young, impressionable ladies) are acting like what they see on TV. In this sense, life imitates art rather than the other way around, and a vicious cycle starts. I could go on and on, but you get my point."

With the accounts of the early Biblical Christians living communally and giving their goods to the poor, it seemed as if they (and by extension, Jesus) had a lot in common with the more idealistic hippies of the 1960s."

To me none of this makes any sense. Things like this is what made me question the validity of religion in the first place.\n\nI DO believe in the ultimate being. This world & its functions didn't create itself. There were programs to follow & rules set forth.\nSure the universe probably came from a big bang. But something had to make the bang possible. Evolution all well & good, yes, but something was programmed to make that possible.\nI'm not an atheist because of religious reasons but rather for logical reasons. Something had to come from something.\n\nBut I don't believe in this Satan Devil character at all.\nIt's hokey.\nGod created an assistant???\nWhat the hell does God need an ""assistant"" for anyhow?\nThis is not limited mankind this is Ultimate Being!\nGod needs nothing but God.\n\nIn fact this whole thing about God needing us makes no sense either. For what?\nIf God needs others then God is limited and not the ultimate being. And if what we refer to as God is not the ultimate being than who is? I ain't got time for no middlemen. Who's the top dog?\n\nMy theory on this whole universe is that it is nothing more than God exploded. All pieces and parts within are fractions of the whole, the ultimate. From a simple rock to the species of mankind to oil sludge.\nWhy this happened no one will ever know. We're only fractions and we can only get fractional information.\n\nIt is true. God always was and always will be. But hell if we'll ever know why that is or why it should be.\nJohn Lucas"
1,"Who believes in MIRACLES and the POWER of PRAYER ?  ...... details inside?
I have made several prayer requests (check my profile)  for my close friend April, who has been in the hospital for more than 4 months. She was in a coma for over a month, after her cowardly ex b/f gave her a severe concussion. \n\nDoctors weren't sure she would ever come out of coma and they claimed she had 65% permanent brain damage, with very little chance of any significant recovery.\n\nI found this very difficult to accept, as April certainly didn't deserve to suffer so much at such a young age (23). I prayed that God would help April fully regain her health, and I had faith that she would be healed.\n\nFor those who have offered their prayers & kind words to my previous requests, you have my sincere thanks ...... April came out of her coma about a month ago, and she is showing steady improvement as time passes. She is now able to recognize close friends & communicate with them : )\n\nAll Praise be to God !
Hi \n\nI have to say that i CERTAINLY believe in prayer and miracles.\n\nA little story........just 15 months ago, my body was crushed by an 18 wheeler truck. My pelvis was completely detached, along with a tennis ball size hole that was torn all the way through my lower abdomen. There were many, many other gruesome injuries as well. I was expected to die by my doctors, but, i believe, though positive thought and ALOT of prayer, i survived. I lost all body function for a few months, but now, the only visible sign is that i walk with a cane. This was my second near death experience in my life. Everything else is back to how it was. I'm a very healthy 26 year old male. I was in a foreign country, so i had absolutely nobody to visit me everyday. I layed in a hospital bed for eight months and had to be taught how to use my body all over again. But, i prayed and conditioned my mind to believe i was getting better, and i did.\nAs long as your friend has friends and family who love her, just be there for her and keep believing and have faith.....everything will work out the way it supposed to.

1,"Muhammad about Jesus, Is it true?
""Ibn Mas'ud said of Muhammad [saw]; I recall seeing the Holy Prophet while he recounted that a Prophet of God who was beaten and wounded by his people kept wiping blood away from his face and supplicated; ""Allah do forgive my people for they no not."" [Bukhari & Muslim].\n\n""Ayesha (wife of Muhammad) said that the Holy Prophet never struck anyone, neither a servant nor a maid, but, of course, he fought in the cause of God. He never exacted retribution for any injury done him..... [Muslim]
Yes it is true, but what is meant by it should not be assumed to be a limitation of others to focus on, but ask for those without understanding to be granted understanding, so forgiveness may become evident.\n\nBoth Christians and Muslims aught to be brothers and not see faults in the other, this will bring the peace that Allah/God is conducive to. Those without peace haven't accepted Allah's/God's guidance as much as those with peace in their souls, that they most eagerly share.\n\n""Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the children of God."""

2,"How do you take the derivitive of a complex function?
Let z = x +iy. How would you compute the derivitive of f(z)? I know f(z) could be anything, but please give some examples.
A complex function is differentiable at a point z0 if the limit z -> z0  (f(z) - f(z0))/(z - z0) exists. However, the differivative no longer has any geometrical interpretation.\n\nThe differentiation can be done in a fashion that resembles real differentiation using the definition:\n\nlim dz -> z   ( f(z0 + dz) - f(z0) ) / dz\n\nHowever since z is a complex plane, the limit as dz -> z can approach from any direction. If it is differentiable, the value of the derivative is the same when approached from any direction, so a path is chosen that makes the calculations easy, typically keeping the real or imaginary part constant and just approaching in a direction parallel to either axis. The effect is that the limit calculation is done on a single variable. But this only finds the derivative at a single point.\n\nEquations for the derivative of a function can be found by using the Cauchy-Riemann Equations, where valid, if \nw = f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)\n\nin which case if partial du/dx = dv/dy AND partial dv/dx = -du/dy AND all theses derivatives are continuous, then \n\ndw/dz = partial du/dx + i dv/dx = partial dv/dy - i du/dy"
2,"what is the cause for tornadoes?

Most tornadoes follow a recognizable life cycle.[6] The cycle begins when a strong thunderstorm develops a rotating mesocyclone a few miles up in the atmosphere, becoming a supercell. As rainfall in the storm increases, it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.\n\nAs the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a wall cloud. As the funnel decends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.\n\nInitially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the mature stage. During its mature stage, which can last a few minutes to more than an hour, a tornado often causes the most damage, and can in rare instances be more than one mile across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.\n\nAs the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the tornado begins to weaken, becoming thin and rope-like. This is the dissipating stage, and the tornado often fizzles within minutes. During the dissipating stage, the tornado becomes highly influenced by the direction of surface winds, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.\n\nThough this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vorticies. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one."
3,"Give me some useful tips to reduce my belly?
My body is look normal but my belly is too big than my body, so i like to reduce it.
You are spending a little to much time in front of a desk, and need to become more active. I suggest you begin with a regiment of walking to begin to build your endurance. After a week or so of daily power walking, you can begin to focus on your abs. This is done by doing sit up, or crunches. They focus on the abs and will begin to show results quickly. As your program ramps up you will notice an increase in apatite as your body begins to use more energy. You need to eat healthy, and in moderation. I suggest fruits as they are a great source of energy and help your overall digestive system. Plus they just taste great naturally!"

1,"Why is the god in the old T so mean? And why so different from the new T?
Just curious. A passing thought through my mind, such as it is.
This is only a theory, \nbut when Constantine and the Council of Nicaea canonised the Bible, they weren't too kind to the Jews. They didn't want anything to do with them as they felt Jews were beneath them. So they made it known, separated Easter from Passover, introduced the death penalty for ministering Judaism, same for those listening, coined the term 'Christ Killers' and basically treated them like dirt, and the same went for their Prophet and Book. \nAfter changing words in the Bible, adding to it (words like 'begotten' meaning to sire or father), calling Jesus a son of God - which was more powerful than having a Prophet who was only spoken to by God, they then started to regain their power back away from the people.... and all because some guy called Jesus had stirred up plenty of trouble for Rome by giving out free medicals and telling them to believe in One God that created all of us.\nThey set out to burn any Bible that didn't match their own and kill anyone who wouldn't accept the new doctrine - crusades. \nThe God of Constantine in the NT would certainly be more merciful than the God of the Moses in the OT.... it says so, as written by powerful political men of the 4th Century.\n:)"

3,"i hve fear of driving,i think either i will kill some one or get killed myself,or somethin unpleasant,help?
is this due 2 imagination since lot of people die in accidents esp bikes,help
I'm making a guess here, but you may be suffering from a form of panic attack syndrome.  It's been my experience that with PAS, people will oftentimes develop an irrational fear that springs from one identifiable event (or not so easily identifiable) that hits them with such force  that from then on, a feeling of dread comes over them each time they find themselves in a similar situation.  I had a friend who would clutch every time they were driving, but only when they went over a long bridge.  Another person I knew, who couldn't have been a more loving mom, had a thought once of picking up scissors and doing something to her child. She was mortified, but now can't completely get the offending thought out of her mind.  Is this what you're experiencing with driving.  If so, think seriously about this question:  was there a defining moment when you were driving or thinking about driving that this thought of killing someone or getting killed yourself ""swept"" over you?  I've discovered with PAS, that you might have had similar thoughts before and easily dismissed them, but at a particularly vulnerable point the same thought has much greater sway over you, and is frightening at that point.  What makes it frightening is that along with the thought comes the PANIC ATTACK or sense of dread, and we react to the instigating thought in a much more fearful way because of the sensation of panic that attends the thought.  Why it becomes difficult is that we often lose sight of the initial moment when this PANIC(or dread) first hit us, and especially fail to notice that we may have been uniquely (for us) vulnerable at that moment due to prior lack of sleep, excess caffeine intake, outside stress, painful life events, etc. Hope this wasn't too rambling an answer, but the things that best helped me were 1) letting the ""feeling"" that comes along with the fear wash over me rather that fighting it or trying to shut it off - it loses its sting that way, or 2) the proper antidepressant."

The dr. and I figured out this was what was causing it, and I haven't been back yet to see what he's going to suggest. I need some suggetions and I do appreciate your time. In Texas, HELP!
Usually, if you have a reaction to thyroid medication, it signifies that the dosage needs adjusted.  There are other thyroid meds so I am sure your doctor will put you on something else.  Meanwhile, there is nothing that you can do.  There are no OTC treatments and no changes in diet that will help.  The only current and effective treatment for  hypothyroidism is a prescribed medication.  I suggest you schedule an appointment with your doctor asap."
3,"How does fluoride in water work on teeth - through ingestion or because it washes over your teeth?

When we are young, about ten and under fluoride works systemically, meaning from within.  Because teeth are still developing, the f2 helps with the formation of the enamel and dentin.  Have you ever seen children with white spots that are part of their natural tooth structure?  This is called fluorosis and is just an ingestion of to much f2.  As we get older and our tooth formation is complete f2 works from the outside, meaning it coats and covers your teeth helping them to resist bacteria and make teeth stronger.  Sometimes we use too much toothpaste on our little one's toothbrush, thus leading to the white spots.  The spots are not dangerous, just sometimes unsightly.  The issue with using too much toothpaste on a young child's toothbrush is fear of overdose which can be fatal, even in small doses.  so make sure to use a very small amount on a child younger then six to be sure this is not an issue."
1,"A question to christians....?
If this god of yours is so great, why am I convinced more and more everyday at him being a complete fable and fraud because I have something that's been described as ""a doctor's worst nightmare"" and without any cure whatsoever?\n\nIf anything, being stuck with this horrible disease is what pushed me towards Atheism to begin with.  I prayed and prayed, but not a ******* thing happened.  Still, nothing can be done.  What kind of tyrant would do such a thing to a person?  Why would this omnipotent creature even create it to begin with?  \n\nI can't see how you can sit there and tell me with a straight face that if this god of yours were real, he loves me and did it out of love and/or whatever.  If he is real, he's nothing but a tyrant and I don't see how anyone can say otherwise, nor even consider worshipping such a monster.  There isn't anything that can be gained from this, if he were real and loving, instead of fake or a tyrant, he'd make it go away.

Sounds like you need to watch what you say around him.  Punishing him would be silly considering he was just repeating what he heard and probably had no idea it was wrong.  Kids are like sponges - they are learning from everything they observe.\n\nI have found in situations like that that if you seriously expalain that what he said was not polite (I would explain exactly why - that saying that word is a vulgar way of talking about a girl's private parts, but I'll leave that to you).  It may need to be firmly repeated a few times.\n\nIf they get a rise out of you, that will only make it more exciting to say."
2,"Is there proof that the red shift measures velocity of remote stars, and not also due to gravity red shifts?
Hubble initially called the red shift  ""...apparent Doppler effect..."" and the apparent was forgotten. There are also three contributions the the red shift and they are only due to gravity   . The only direct observations of star/galaxy motion is for transverse (proper - angular) motion. Changes of light intensity could demonstrate receeding motion but there are other causes of light intensity. See: http//inventing-solutions.com/simplified-universe.htm for details.
Yes there is.\n\nSupernova decay curves show the time dilation that would be expected from rapid motion (i.e. taking the redshift as a doppler velocity) so we know it isn't tired light.\n\nA lot of other methods of measuring distance have been developed and those are used to calibrate the redshift measurements (by finding the Hubble Constant)."

this will give you a brief idea \n\nBharat Petroleum's ERP implementation is one of the biggest of its kind in the country. A look at what this petro giant did to bring it all together.\n\nHow do you streamline processes in a company with 210 branches and more than 10,000 people? This was the question that worried the management at Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) before it decided to try out an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) package called SAP R/3.\n\nTaking Stock of the situation\n\nThe implementation had begun in phases in April 2000. The network was redesigned and structured for the nationwide exercise. The company has 5,200-odd executive staff who had to be connected. Now the network is large, robust and able to support all of SAP R/3's requirements through a centralized systems architecture.\n\nWay back in December 1997, BPCL implemented a VSAT-based WAN (Wide Area Network) with backup from I-Net and OilComNet. Currently, there are redundant links using connections from VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal), Oil ComNet, ISDN, leased lines and even dial-up connecting remote locations.\n\nPlans for a Private Hub\n\nBut General Manager, Information Systems, Anand Teltumbde, said his company plans to have a private VSAT hub in Noida: ""That's crucial because India's bandwidth resources are limited."" So now BPCL has seven PAMA (Permanent Assigned Multiple Access) links nationwide. It hopes to upgrade those to DAMA (Demand Assigned Multiple Access) links soon.\n\nPAMA is a technology by which a particular VSAT channel is assigned solely for communication between two stations. DAMA involves bursty satellite data transfer. There are two levels of channel access. The first level is for short reservation packets containing information regarding the station's demand. The second level is for the actual data messages that are typically longer than the request packets.\n\nInternet Gateway Access Systems have been deployed at the company's central office in Mumbai and at regional offices in Kolkata, Chennai and New Delhi. It also has corporation-wide e-mail with MS Exchange, and MS Outlook 98 as client. With this, OmniFax has been integrated to cut down on fax costs."

Everybody else that I hang out wiht, has started their period already.  My mom started when she was 11! But my mom's step sister started when she almost 17 years old! SO what about me?
Don't worry.  Every girl is different.  Your body isn't ready yet and that is normal.  Enjoy not having a period yet because they really suck for most girls.  My daughter is 12 and she spotted once when she was 11 and then nothing since.  That can happen too.  Normal.  Most girls don't get their period and have a regular 28 day cycle from the beginning.  I've known lots of girls that don't get their period until they are in their mid to late teens.

My dog is chewing the walls, the rent is higher than most places in the area, I cannot afford it anymore.  I am very unhappy with the apt. and I am paying TOP DOLLAR for it.  There is an exact apt next to me that is $250 cheaper than mine and my landlord won't budge...I cannot afford this apt anymore and I WANT OUT!!!
Your landlord doesn't have to budge.  You agreed to pay X dollars and thats that.   They  have the option of either lowering your rent or losing you as a tenant.  From their response, their answer is that they don't mind losing you.\n\nIf you break your lease and move, you will still be responsible for the difference between what they rent it out for and what you were paying for the remainder of your lease.  You will also be responsible for the rent until they find a new tenant.  The have a duty to mitigate their loss by re-renting the unit asap.  \n\nIn other words, if it takes them 1 month to find a tenant, you owe them 1 months rent at your current rate and if the new tenants rent is less than yours, you owe the difference between what they are paying and what you were paying until the time when your lease would have expired.  You may also owe any fees for advertising, etc.\n\nOr your lease may even have a buy-out clause.  You will need to look at it to find out.\n\nSometimes if you explain that you can't afford the rent any more, a landlord will work with you because if it turns into a non-payment matter, they won't be getting any money while they go through the process of evicting you.  \n\nLandlords can and often times will proceed with getting a judgment against you for unpaid rent.  Some landlords just write it off, but more and more landlords are going after ex-tenants for the money."
2,"What is the bacteria called that causes spots or acne?
the name we were given by our teacher was bacillus subtilis but iv searched on the internet and it says thats something to do with soil...???
You are right, bacillus subtillis is from the soil,although every now and then you will find it as a contaminant in air. (dust in the wind....)\n Wait, your teacher is  also right.  I have searched a bit more and found that newer medications are looking into using a Bacillus preparation for the prevention of pimples. It didnt say it was the subtillis variety though.\nAs for spots or acne, there are several species of bacteria which could cause them, but commonly they would be either staphylococci for the pimple and streptococci for the spots."
7,"Settlement versus Paid in full?
I have balance that has gone into collection and a settlment has been offered. Will it bring down my credit score if I pay the settlement?  Or should I pay it in full? Or, once it has gone to collection it doesn't matter-\nThanks
The last advice given is very incorrect. If you pay off the total amount the account will appear as paid in full and closed but if you on pay the setlement amount it will show as a collections account paid and lenders know this is a settlement.\n\nHere is some information that I wrote on an article about this issue. Hope it helps\n\n""How long will collection or other derogatory information stay on your credit report?""\n\nCredit information can and usually stays on a person’s credit report for 7 years. You can use the information below as a reference to guide yourself and figure out how long derogatory information stays on your credit report\n\nGeneral credit information: 7yrs\nCollections: 7yrs from date of last activity\nBankruptcy: 10 yrs\nForeclosure: 12 yrs from the date filed\nGarnishment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\nJudgment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\nTax lien: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\nDismissed garnishments, judgments, and tax liens: not reportable\n\nNow that you have this information I’ll give you an example similar to a client. The agent he had worked with before gave him the wrong advice.\n\nLets assume that you had a collection for $1,000 filed against you in December 1998 and you haven’t paid it. It’s now November 2005, so in a few weeks that collection can come off your credit report. (You will probably have to request all three credit bureaus to take it off your credit report). However, you just applied for a loan today and the loan officer tells you that you need to payoff that debt in order to be approved. Since you have the money to pay it off, you do so. Because the date of last activity is now November 2005, the collection will show on your report until November 2012 – another additional 7 years.\n\nNow let assume that this collection was in June 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will reduce your credit score. On the other hand if this collection was in September 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will actually increase your score. My point is that a collection account that is less than 6 months old and is paid off will be beneficial but if your collection account is more than 6 months old and is paid off this will be detrimental to your credit score.\n\nYou as a consumer can request copies of your credit report from the 3 credit bureaus (although it’s better to get a collective report from all three in one which I can help you with) and dispute information that is incorrect. Incorrect information can be corrected or removed but correct information (good or bad) usually stays on the report for the period allowed. Only the credit grantor (lender/bank) or credit bureau can remove correct information.\n\nIf you find incorrect information on your report, contact the credit grantor obtain an explanation, have them corrected and ask them to contact all three credit bureaus and correct that information on your report. After this you should also contact all three credit with a letter with documented proof of the error on your report and ask them to remove this information. The credit bureaus by law have to respond to your letter and request. Depending on your case they might approve or deny your request but they have to respond to your letter. Following are the addresses for all three credit bureaus.\n\nTrans Union\nPO Box 4000\nChester, PA 19022\n866-887-2673\nhttp://www.transunion.com/\n\nExperian\nPO Box 2002\nAllen, TX 75013\n888-397-3742\nhttp://www.experian.com/\n\nEquifax Credit\nPO Box 740241\nAtlanta, GA 30374\n800-685-1111\nhttp://www.equifax.com/"

DO YOU THINK HE WILL?
HAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nNo.\n\nWe need all of the illegal immigrants to keep the cost of our base goods down.  They are not stealing any jobs that American want, or that we have the workforce to do.  They supplement the lower class structure and involuntarily push the lowest American citizen to a higher level.  Besides, having illegal immigrants to do these jobs in intrinsic to every successful country.

I recommend it to everyone, even if you use an accountant.  My sister used an accountant.  I convinced her to let me use TT on her return.

And, it transfers data in from the previous year's filing.  I will say it costs way too much.  Watch for the best price around tax time."

i just saw The Matrix Triology again! for some reason and watchin this movie once again, i kinda think that we do live in a dream like state and that we only see what we are shown. we can only see 3 dimensions (the x dimension, the y dimension and the z dimension) but i believe that there should be atleast 7 dimensions. like we have the seven colors of light, or the seven notes of sound, or seven days of the week, the seven oceans, the seven populated continents, the seven planets (since pluto is controversal now and mercury is too hot), and so i think our mind is not yet able to see all the dimensions except for three! what do ya'll think about this?
Travel the oceans and the seven seas.\n\nAncient Seven Seas            Modern Seven Oceans\n                            \n1. Mediterranean              1. North Atlantic\n2.

1,"If someone follows the bible...?
Why are they called legalists?  Legalism is adding to the way of salvation (adding works or baptism to the blood of Jesus...adding man made doctrine to the Bible).  When did following the bible in dress, lifestyle, dating, child raising, etc, become legalistic?
I agree with you on that point.  Many today feel that it’s up to us humans to decide for ourselves what is best.  Some may feel that the Bible’s teachings are no longer valid in our modern world; that it’s okay to change or ignore certain laws and principles because they restrict the lifestyle they chose to lead.  But do humans have the right, the ability, or the wisdom to guide ourselves?  The Bible tells us that man was created with a need to be guided by his creator.  “I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jer. 10:23.\n \nThe Bible reveals that our heavenly Father provides fundamental directives that cover a variety of situations and aspects of life.  He does this with our eternal benefit in view.  Jehovah’s personality and cardinal qualities—love, wisdom, justice, and power—have not changed. He told the people of Israel: “I am Jehovah; I have not changed.” (Malachi 3:6) This was some 3,500 years after God’s creation of mankind. True to that divine statement, a close examination of the Bible as a whole reveals a God who is unchanging in his standards and qualities. There has been no mellowing of Jehovah God’s personality during the centuries, since no such mellowing was needed.\n\nWe should follow the wise counsel found in the Bible because its standards and principles remain valid for any society at any time in history. They help us understand how important it is to be fashioned by God’s standards and not by popular ideas of the modern world.—Isaiah 48:17; Romans 12:2; Ephesians 4:22-24."

“Brilliant spirits often face violent storms of opposition from mediocre minds.”\nAlbert Einstein\n\nHaters, can’t live without ‘em don’t want to hear from them.

Someone once said: \n\n“Life is like a picture, you need negatives to develop.” Think about it, it‘s true. \n\nDestructive criticisms are just compliments in disguise. Don’t let it stop you from doing what you KNOW in your heart is right. This is not justifying hateration, rather learning to see positive through it. \nI‘m sure most of you have grown past getting offended by negative criticism (take this as an encouragement). You can also take some time today to appreciate the haters in your life who have helped you to become a better person. (No I’m not crazy……yet,) it might help you see things differently.\n\nWhat did you think of this message? Sounds like words to live by??

1,"isnt God enough?
do we really need religions? isnt God inside us, living in our souls?
Dear Mexican Beaner:  Of course, He is enough !  For the many who have such experience of The Holy Spirit's thoughts laid upon their hearts, and His Comfort and Guidance and have had direct experiences of Jesus, it is so very difficult to imagine that anyone can be sealed off from their souls or spirit-mind.  It seems as if their Connection is totally severed.\n\nNevertheless, I have learned that in the great healing of the Separation and the Journey that puts us on the path to Return there is an appointed time that each and every soul has agreed to with the Holy Spirit - to begin that Return.  Each age or each century of Time brings us a whole new influx of those willing to look Homeward Bound.  Our Creator's Plan for our Return to the Kingdom is guaranteed.  No brother will fail any other brothers in this.  The physical world is a tired, old, and war weary experience of a type of reality that can be overcome by our Ultimate Reality.  It is working at all times - this Plan of Return.\n\nUntil all brothers/sisters are experiencing the One-ness of our Beings and looking, in happiness, to Returning together as One - we will feel a certain bereft feeling inside ourselves.  We miss our unity, our Oneness, as God Created us to be.\n\nIn the end, we will not fail each other.  As spirit-minds or souls, we are spiritually oriented.  Denial of this, or to be separated by interpretations in a multitude of Churches is a temporary loss of our unified Power within His beloved Kingdom.\n\nSincerely, Lana"

Have u ever heard about the jyothi in sabaramalai(in kerala)?Can U tell about it?\n\nOn Makarsankranth, every year without fail, miraculous events occur. Firstly as the jewels (Thiruvaabaranam) of the Lord are transported from the Old Pandalam Palace to Sabarimala, a Krishnaparanth (holy eagle) circles above the precious cargo, like a protector. This rare eagle is rarely seen in the midst of people for a long period of time, yet the auspicious bird follows the Thiruvaabaranam procession, finally circling above Sanithanam at Shabarimala nine times as it pays its respects to Lord Ayyappan. During this time, there is not a single star in the sky expect for a special Nakshatram. As the beautiful jewels are placed on the golden body of the Lord within the temple, the several hundred thousand devotees outside, crammed into any available free space, chant ""Swamiye Sharanam Ayyappa"". When the jewels are finally all adorned on the Lord, the Nakshatram in the sky miraculously disappears, as all the Devas and Celestial beings leave the sky to get a glimpse of the Lord in all his spleandour. Within moments of the Lord being adorned with the Thiruvabaranam, an effulgence appears in the opposite hills of Shabarimala, appearing 3 times. The entire hillside reverberates with the chant ""Swamiye Sharanam Ayyappa"" as the devotees witness this auspicious sight, as the Devas and Celestial Rishis arrive at Shabarimala as an effulgence. These auspicious sights are different forms of the Lord Himself appearing. The devotees then climb the 18 holy gold steps to arrive at the Sanidhanam where they finally get a glimpse of the Lord as Himself, in all beauty, Manikanta Shri Dharmasastha, adorned with jewels. It is believed that if one witnesses these events after having undertaken 41 days of severe austerities (Vratham), one can attain Moksha.\n\nThis is why Ayyappan is also known as Kaliyugavaradhana, since He can help us to attain Moksha in this difficult age of Kaliyuga, the Age of Hypocracy and Violence.\n\n\nWhat about the matter of aliens & UFO\n\nA UFO or unidentified flying object is any real or apparent flying object which remains unidentified after investigation.\n\nThe UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek described a UFO as ""the reported perception of an object or light seen in the sky or upon the land the appearance, trajectory, and general dynamic and luminescent behaviour of which do not suggest a logical, conventional explanation and which is not only mystifying to the original percipients but remains unidentified after close scrutiny of all available evidence by persons who are technically capable of making a common sense identification, if one is possible.""\n\nMany people believe that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft, but others say there is no compelling evidence to support such a conclusion. Most scientists and academics adhere to a standard of research attributed to Carl Sagan that ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"". As a result, critiques are often made against those who believe that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nALIENS are nothing but extra terrestrial life\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life\n\nAre there any medicines for cancer?If not discovered ,Why??\n\nCancer could be cured with some medicines but not in all stages and all cases, however ayurveda says it can cure cancer by all means, in this present era nobody either trusts it or has the patience to under go such a long and tough treatment.\n\nTreatment in allopathy\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer#Treatment_of_cancer\n\nWhy do the eyes of some animals say cat shine in dark\n\nCat's eyes are a type of road marker using retroreflectors \nThe reflective property of certain gems: Chatoyancy \nCat's Eye Nebula is a planetary nebula \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_eye\n\nWhich is the most dangerous disease presently??????\n\nAIDS \n\nSo did u forget to post your 6th question... ???"

2,"What is the Coriolis Fairy?

Coriolis Fairy is a myth about the Coriolis Force wherein it is believed that in the northern hemisphere, water goes down the toilet clockwise. And it twirls counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n\nTechnically speaking, the Coriolis is not even a real force, but a fictitious one resulting from a rotating frame of reference. It's an apparent deviation caused by the inertia of an object traveling above the earth's surface while the planet spins eastward below; it's fictitious in the sense that if the globe were not spinning, there would be no deviation. This effect was first described by nineteenth-century French mathematician Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis, who evidently became interested in the motion of rotating bodies after writing ""The Mathematical Theory of the Game of Billiards.""\n\nTo understand why it works, imagine that you are looking down at the globe from above. The earth would look like an old-fashioned vinyl record player, with the North Pole for the axis. At the center, the record moves so slowly that it appears to stand still, while at the far edge the record is traveling quickly, where it has more distance to cover in each revolution. Similarly, at the equator, the earth is moving from west to east at 1,040 miles per hour, while at the latitude of Long Island it is moving closer to 700 miles per hour."

Yes, the bank, you can't borrow money for vacant land like you can for a mortgage, so you don't have the same large pool of money to borrow from. \n\nYou will be required to put as much as 50% down and maybe as little as 25% if you are lucky. I would verify this though as my info about this came along to me a while back and things may have changed a bit since then.\n\nYou might have better luck if you are going to live there, maybe a mobile home trailer or maybe a small manufactured home, or just go for the gusto and get a construction loan to build the house you want there."
2,"How long on average do blue whales get? and does blue whales have any natural predators?

The Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the suborder of baleen whales. At up to 30 metres (98 feet) in length and 177 metric tonnes (196 short tons) or more in weight, it is believed to be the largest animal to have ever lived on Earth.[2]\n\nBlue Whales were abundant in most oceans around the world until the beginning of the twentieth century. For the first 40 years of that century they were hunted by whalers almost to extinction. Hunting of the species was outlawed by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 Blue Whales worldwide[3] located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggest this may be an under-estimate.[4] Before whaling the largest population (202,000 to 311,000) was in the Antarctic[5] but now there remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the North-East Pacific, the Antarctic, and the Indian Ocean. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whales\n\nOnly man (i.e. whalers) is its enemy....I don't know about natural predators.\n\nHope this helps.

At the time the area was Greek and is now on the southern coast of Turkey. His wealthy parents, who raised him to be a devout Christian, died in an epidemic while Nicholas was still young. Obeying Jesus' words to ""sell what you own and give the money to the poor,"" Nicholas used his whole inheritance to assist the needy, the sick, and the suffering. He dedicated his life to serving God and was made Bishop of Myra while still a young man. Bishop Nicholas became known throughout the land for his generosity to the those in need, his love for children, and his concern for sailors and ships.\n\nUnder the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who ruthlessly persecuted Christians, Bishop Nicholas suffered for his faith, was exiled and imprisoned. The prisons were so full of bishops, priests, and deacons, there was no room for the real criminals—murderers, thieves and robbers. After his release, Nicholas attended the Council of Nicaea in AD 325. He died December 6, AD 343 in Myra and was buried in his cathedral church, where a unique relic, called manna, formed in his grave. This liquid substance, said to have healing powers, fostered the growth of devotion to Nicholas. The anniversary of his death became a day of celebration, St. Nicholas Day.\n\nThrough the centuries many stories and legends have been told of St. Nicholas' life and deeds. These accounts help us understand his extraordinary character and why he is so beloved and revered as protector and helper of those in need.\n\nOne story tells of a poor man with three daughters. In those days a young woman's father had to offer prospective husbands something of value—a dowry. The larger the dowry, the better the chance that a young woman would find a good husband. Without a dowry, a woman was unlikely to marry. This poor man's daughters, without dowries, were therefore destined to be sold into slavery. Mysteriously, on three different occasions, a bag of gold appeared in their home-providing the needed dowries. The bags of gold, tossed through an open window, are said to have landed in stockings or shoes left before the fire to dry. This led to the custom of children hanging stockings or putting out shoes, eagerly awaiting gifts from Saint Nicholas. Sometimes the story is told with gold balls instead of bags of gold. That is why three gold balls, sometimes represented as oranges, are one of the symbols for St. Nicholas. And so St. Nicholas is a gift-giver.\n\nOne of the oldest stories showing St. Nicholas as a protector of children takes place long after his death. The townspeople of Myra were celebrating the good saint on the eve of his feast day when a band of Arab pirates from Crete came into the district. They stole treasures from the Church of Saint Nicholas to take away as booty. As they were leaving town, they snatched a young boy, Basilios, to make into a slave. The emir, or ruler, selected Basilios to be his personal cupbearer, as not knowing the language, Basilios would not understand what the king said to those around him. So, for the next year Basilios waited on the king, bringing his wine in a beautiful golden cup. For Basilios' parents, devastated at the loss of their only child, the year passed slowly, filled with grief. As the next St. Nicholas' feast day approached, Basilios' mother would not join in the festivity, as it was now a day of tragedy. However, she was persuaded to have a simple observance at home—with quiet prayers for Basilios' safekeeping. Meanwhile, as Basilios was fulfilling his tasks serving the emir, he was suddenly whisked up and away. St. Nicholas appeared to the terrified boy, blessed him, and set him down at his home back in Myra. Imagine the joy and wonderment when Basilios amazingly appeared before his parents, still holding the king's golden cup. This is the first story told o"
3,"What do you know about GERD? Does it go away?

GERD stands for gastro esophagal reflux disease. It is caused by acid from the stomach coming up to the esophagus due to a loose esophagal sphincter.\n\nThere is no known cure for GERD. Most of the medications try to lower the acid content in the stomach but they dont strengthen the sphincter.\n\nA complication of GERD is esophagitis, an inflammation and erosion of the esophagal lining. This may lead to barretts esophagus(Grade 4 esophagitis), an irreversible condition.\n\nBarretts Esophagus highly increases the risk for esophagal cancer, which is a higly fatal cancer. What exactly causes Barrets to develop into cancer is not well known at the moment."
2,"Math homework help!?
Some airlines offer telephones for passengers. On one airline, the cost of a phone call to the ground is $2 + $2 per minute, charged at the beginning of each minute.\na. how much does it cost the instant your phone call is made?\nb. how much does it cost after 30 seconds?\nc. do you think cost is a function of time? why or why not.
The slope-intercept equation, y=mx+b is what you need.  Two dollars is the intercept, that is to say, what you are charged when the number of minutes, x, is zero.  The number of minutes is multiplied by the slope, m, which is also two dollars.\n\nSo the equation which will pop out the answers is cost=$2.00(mimutes) + $2.00.  The same as y=2x+2.\n\na. the instant the call is made, the charge is $4.\nb. after 30 seconds its $4.\nc.cost is a function of time, plus the constant charge of $2 for just making a call ( the intercept, b).  This is a linear function in x.\n\nEDIT\n\nif cost per minute is charged at the beginning of each minute, then b. is $4, because you aren't charged for 30 sec, you are charged for that whole minute.  And a. would also be $4 because you are getting into that first minute."

Active transport is the movement of something against its gradient across a membrane (from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration).  This process usually may involve a protein specific to the molecule that is being transported (such as carrier proteins) and it always involves energy of some kind, whether it be a membrane potential (the voltage difference across a membrane), ATP, GTP, etc."
7,"Do MLM make money?
i've join a network marketing company and they share lots of vision and dreams which made mi veri interested but it seems to me its veri hard to make money from there!
To make it big in Multi-Level Marketing, you have to convince lots of people to work under you. Every member becomes a conman trying to talk their friends into joining to make money for them. People will lie to get their friends to join under them. Unfortunately, they end up alienating all their friends who don't want to hear about it. After all their conning, they find they have lost money to the big organization, which is the only one really making any money. \n\nThis is not to say all multilevel marketing plans are scams, but so many are scams, it's best to avoid them altogether."

2,"why is it the the concept of mind over matter is so hard to put into action?

There is no absolutely proven link for mind over matter. In terms of using your mind to overcome pain, then this may be possible as you are simply training your brain to ignore pain signals. Walking over hot coals may be an example of this, but again scientists are divided over whether this is true mind-over-matter.\n\nIn terms of using your mind to move objects across a room, then i think this highly unlikely to be acheivable, purely for the fact that it would require an immense energy exchange."
1,"How valid is Sunday as the seventh day or day of rest?

It is a tradition of pagan men (specifically Emperor Constantine & those who follow him). It directly contradicts God's will as expressed in the 10 Commandments. God views iniquity like this as an abhorrent abomination.\n\nWe should not test God's Grace. (Do not sin in order to make Grace abound.)\n\nAnyway, the Sabbath Rest was made FOR man - don't abuse it (don't desecrate it); enjoy the Gift with praise & worship as intended."
2,"Is there some type if benefit in having a single basic cell design for both plants and animals?

Nature has determined this design to be the most efficient and useful for higher order organisms.  There are two types of cell ""designs"", prokaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (plant and animal cells).  It is thought that at one point all living things were prokaryotic, then at some point in our evolution a nuclear envelope was developed and proved to be beneficial to the organism, thereby natural selection allowed for the continuation of a nuclear envelope.  As time went by plants and animals both evolved from some ancestor of this first eukaryotic cell and henceforth have similar cell designs.  As for the actual benefits of this design, the nuclear envelope of plant and animal cells serve to protect the DNA, and therefore genes, of the animal from damage, and also serves as a type of filter seperating cellular processess in the cytosol from gene regulation in the nucleus."
2,"is an allotrope a compound or a mixture?

Neither. Allotropes are different forms of a pure element.\n\nFor example, both graphite and diamond are pure carbon. They differ in the way the carbon atoms are bonded to each other, which gives them different physical properties.\n\nSince there is only one element present, allotropes cannot be compounds. Since there are not multiple compounds present, allotropes also cannot be mixtures."
1,"Why is suicide wrong if Jesus committed it?
I know a few of you Christians will say he was ""killed,"" but it was his choice to get killed. He came specifically to get killed. If Jesus = god (according to the trinity) and he basically came here to die, he did commit suicide. If that's not suicide, asking someone else to kill me wouldn't be?

Why are you so bent on ""proving"" there is no God? if thats what you believe, why can't you keep it to yourself like you tell us Christians to?
I quite agree with your laissez-faire attitude. i think some athiests have a ""bees in their bonnets"" and no real respect for others' beliefs. And they form quite a vociferous lobby in the USA at the moment.\n\nBut I think the boot is generally on the other foot. Even fairly secular states like the UK or Denmark are officially Christian, and in the Moslem world, forget it! If you don't pay lip-service to their belief structure you will have quite a few problems."

2,"find the shaded area of a geometric shape?
finding the shaded area inside of a geometric shape
There are two ways to measure the area of a shaded figure. The third is by integral calculus.\n\nMethod 1. \n\nStep 1. Draw the figure on a graph paper by choosing suitable scales in x and y axes.\nStep 2. Count the small squares that are shaded. If a square is not whole, then count it as one if it is greater than half a square. Skip it if it is less than half. And of course, two halves make a whole.\nStep 3. Convert it to area by multiplying the number of squares with area of 1 square.\n\nMethod 2.\nCase 1:\nIf the figure is a polygon, draw diagonals from from corner points and break it down to triangles.\nNow, the area of triangles can be calculated mainly by two formulae.\n\nArea of a triangle = (1/2) base * altitude\n= square root of [s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] \n\nThe second formula is very useful and practised in surveying. Here, a,b, and c are the three sides of a triangle; and s is the semi-perimeter i.e. s=(1/2)(a+b+c)\n\nCase 2:\nIf the boundary of the figure is curved, the the matter is a bit harder. If it is a circle or a part of a circle, use formula: area= pi*r squared; pi is approximately 3.1416..  Or else, you have to replace the curve by a straight line such that the area remains the same by eye.\n\nBy integral calculus, area can be found by using table of formula."
1,"How is it that religion is the only way to have a moral compass?

Not true.  People don't behave morally because they attend church.  People choose to behave morally because it pays off.  \n\nThink of it this way: Why do most people obey the law? -- Because that behavior makes it possible for all of us to get along, most of the time.  When laws are broken, people get hurt, or worse.  Most people don't want to be harmed in any way, therefore they obey the law because it pays off.\n\nBehaving morally makes sense, for the same reason: If you find out that someone has lied to you (for example), or defrauded or cheated you, you'll want nothing more to do with that person.  The other guy has now lost something valuable -- your trust -- and it's his own fault for behaving immorally.  See how it works?\n\nDon't let the godidiots tell you that nonbelievers have no morals.  It's not true."
7,"Would I be able to become a pilot without military training, how much time and money would I need?
I'm 19 years old with all the time in the world, but money may be an issue.
You can get your private pilot's license w/o any training and that would allow you to fly small single engine planes. Typically you need about 40 hrs of flight time (both solo and with an instructor) and then must take several exams in order to obtain it. I work at an airport and its $80.00 an hour for a lesson and then $55.00 an hour for solo time in the plane but the rates are going to vary on where you go. I don't know what you are looking to do as far as flying but my step-sister was going to school to become a commercial pilot down in Florida and the schooling for that was about $75,000.00...Unless you are interested in going into the military though, getting any sort of certification to fly is going to cost money but if its something that you want to pursue for career purposes, then any money invested into it will be worth it.

So i mispelled a word (excuse me) , But if all you care to do is critize my spelling,please dont waste my time.. I still dont understand why some people have to be so rude, I picked a answer thank you very much mam or sir..
It's best to have a good thorough physical examination as the majority of herniated discs are not painful.  When MRI was invented, healthy pain free volunteers were scanned just to see what normal anatomy was like.  What was discovered was that a lot of these healthy volunteers had herniated and bulging discs with no pain.  There are other structures that cause pain in the spine as well, unfortunately, many physicians go right to the MRI, see a herniated disc and blame it for all pain.  A good thourough examination will often reveal the structure causing pain and the MRI  should be used to confirm these findings, otherwise it may lead to inappropriate treatment.  You also didn't mention what actually hurts; is it your neck only or your arm as well?  You may want to see a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician (Physiatrist) in your area for treatment."

1,"Is it hard for our society to not  judge other people? Do you judge? What do you judge in other people? Why?!!

Whenver I feel myself pulling the measuring stick from my back pocket, I try to remind myself of the following scripture:\n\n""Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye"" (Matthew 7:1-5)\n\nIt's hard, but .. if you recite this from time to time. it's helps me to slow down on judging others."
1,"Are there other books in the BIBLE that should be included in today's version of the BIBLE?
Ever heard of the BOOK of ENOCH and other books that were supposed to be SCRIPTURES of old but then were not included because of CANONISM? If God can protect the ARK of the COVENANT back in the OLD TESTAMENT DAYS (HE struck dead those who touch it or see it) can same be true today of THE BIBLE which is the WORD OF GOD from any alterations or deletions? Is CANONISM divinely inspired or mere assembly of men practicing THEOLOGY... how can we know other books claiming to be God's word were true or false...aka. when other religions (Islam, Mormons, etc.) add several books to THE BIBLE... \n\nI'm a little confused here.
I'm glad you asked this question.\n\nThere are several ""apocryphal"" books. Apocryphal is the word used that means basically ""books that aren't concidered divinely inspired"". These books were not excepted as scripture for two main reasons.\n1) As far as Old Testament books are concerned, books like ""The Book of Enoch,"" ""The Assumption of Moses"" and ""Odes of Soloman"" amongst others, were never excepted even in Jesus' time by the Jews.\n2) In the New Testament, Jesus never refers to them in His teachings.\n\nI have read these books and you really have to take them with a grain of salt. There fantastic stories, but you cannot take them as you would what's in the Bible. I know that in the book of Jude he refers to a couple of them. But you need to realize that these ""apocryphal"" books do have truths in them, but they cannot be excepted as truth as a whole. Does that make sence? Jude was just pointing out a universal ""absolute"" truth that was mentioned in one of them.\n\nNow, beware, there are many New Testament ""apocryphal"" books too. ""The Gospel of Thomas"", ""The Gospel of Mary Magdaline"" and many others that are considered ""gnostic"" gospels. They were written decades after the supposed time the book itself says it was written. Besides that, they don't line up with what IS canonical. You really have to read the introductions the translaters make before you deside to read them.\n\nI do, however, have a recommendation. It is truly safe and helpful to read the writting of the ""Early Church Father"". This includes saints like Justin Martyr, Ignatious of Antioch, 1 Clement, 2 Clememt, (my favorite) Polycarp, all of these men were the disciples of the disciples and they have really alot of encouraging and helpful things to say about how church was when it was still a baby. \n\nThere is so much more that I would like to relay on this subject but I'm afraid that I'm taking to much of your time.  There is one other thing, for a good, easy reading book on the subject that will answer all of your questions I recommend a book called, ""How we got the Bible"" by Neil Lightfoot. You can find it at any Christian bookstore, and many secular bookstores too."

2,"what is the value of sin(-240 degrees)? is it positive or negative rad3/2? How did you receive the answer?

As the early answer said, -240 degrees is the same as +120 degrees. That puts the angle in the second quadrant, where the sine is positive. You correctly analyzed that the related angle (the angle to the nearest portion of the x axis) is 60 degrees, which has a sine of sqrt(3)/2. And it is positive, because of the quadrant.\n\nLet me teach you a neat way to remember which trigonometric signs are positive in which quadrant. Just remember that ""All Students Take Calculus"". The first letters of each of these words tell you what is positive in each quadrant: All (sin,cos,tan) in the 1st quadrant, Sine in the second, Tangent in the third, Cosine in the fourth. This is from the Saxon textbook series that we use in my school. (Yes, it's also an attempt to brainwash students into taking higher levels of math.)"

Hi dear\nI'm a college student in computer science and wanna to start a new site which is based on my own ideas. \nI think that I have no any expriences and should get some hints by people who have had same scenario. \nSo, I will be very glad having your opinions\nAbout my site:\n1. Should I start with full version( all of my ideas implemented) or complete it little by little?\n2. How can I trust to my ideas?( will they work as I think?)\n3. Should I share it with somebody else?\n\nRegards
1. SHOULD I START WITH THE FULL VERSION OR COMPLETE IT LITTLE BY LITTLE?\n\nIt depends on a lot of factors:\n\n- Availability of resources: do you have the funds to provide the complete idea, or are you able to afford only a piecemeal implementation?\n\n- Technical resources: do you have the programming skills required to complete the whole idea at once or would you need additional manpower?\n\n- Impact of full vs. piecemeal implementation: for a visitor to get hooked on your site or sold on your offering, would it suffice to do it pieacemeal or do you need to offer the entire thing before users can find value on the site?\n\n- Getting visitors: If you offer it piecemeal, how sure are you that visitors will come back to your site to see more of your offerings and your complete idea?\n\n2. HOW CAN I TRUST MY IDEAS?\n\nYou really won't know your ideas will work until you test them. Some companies conduct market surveys and talk to their target customers to see if this is a product they want, will find useful or would actually use. You can do something like a concept survey. But then again, you have companies like Sony which launched Sony Walkman without doing a single market research because the chairman believed instinctively that Walkman would work\n\nOtherwise, just do it. Michael Dell in his autobiography said that when he had the idea of selling computers directly to the public, he was told by respected people in the field that his idea will not work. But he persisted and found that his idea indeed works.\n\n3. SHOULD I SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?\n\nIt depends entirely to you:\n\n- Do you have all the resources you need? If not, then finding an investor or partner could help ease your resource constraints\n- Do you have all the technical skills you need?\n- Do you have the marketing skills needed?"

1,"Catholic Question?
I know that it is not allowed to have homosexual activity or to get married but is it a sin to have a girlfriend? If so, is it mortal or venial? I mean I do not have one but I really want to, and I would not do anything more than kiss her but still I do not want to sin.
The Catholic Church considers all homosexual activity to be sinful. It is not necessarily sinful to be a homosexual, because, one may have a homosexual orientation but not act on it. \n\nHowever, if one acts on their homosexual orientation (sexual thoughts about another woman, kissing another woman, pursuing a romantic relationship with another woman) it is consider sinful.\n\nLike with most sins, you will not be excommunicated from the Catholic Church, but it would prove to be an obstacle in receiving the sacraments, such as Communion. In order to receive Communion, you must confess your sins. And in order to make a confession, you must truly be sorry for your sin and have a genuine intention of not committing the sin. Therefore, it would be hard to make the confession in order to receive Communion.\n\nHowever, there are many gays and lesbians who still consider themselves Catholic despite their homosexual relationships. Just like there are a lot of heterosexual people who live with their significant others and are not married and still participate in all the sacraments. As with all things Catholic, finding a good priest to talk to can be very helpful."

When I was quite a bit younger, I had like 4 or 5 coinciding dreams about a girl of which I have never seen before...In all the dreams, we were at a boat dock, and it seemed as though we really liked each other, but everytime she ended up having to leave for me to never see again.

1,"what actually  happens when a person dies.?
Christians say when someone dies he/she goes to hell or heaven . but usually the body rots away. so what goes to heaven? soul witout body or what.
Its either they'll go to Heaven or Hell in a form of soul with the likeness of human body. Please see the links below (sources) to guide you more in this area.\n\nHell\n\nWhy does Hell exist?\n\nThe place Hell is where God cast Lucifer and his legions after rebelling against Him. Lucifer was an archangel with, like others, a free will which he abused and assumed himself higher and mightier that God. Some other angels believe Lucifer, which made God angry so God casts all of these abomination to the place called Hell.\n\nWhy does wicked / unsaved souls leads to Hell?\n\nSince Lucifer or Satan has no power over God, he lured His creations with His likeness (human) to his realm by tricking us, first Adam and Eve, then down to us.\n\nHow can we be saved?\n\nThis is the very reason why the Son of God came to earth to save our soul and pay for our sins. For God loves us so much and He doesn't want any of us to go to such a place. In order to be saved, we should accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, and that we should accept His love and forgiveness, that he died for our sins. On the Judgment day, the Hell itself will be cast to the Lake of Fire, which will be the second death.\n\nWhere is the Hell?\n\nHell is located at the center of the earth. Which forms like a lying silhouette of a human, with head, torso and limb-like dwellings.\n\nHow is it like to be in Hell?\n\nFirst of all, as souls (you after death), we still have all the senses we used to have in our body, only much much keener. And since you're from earth, you even have the feeling that you have flesh (burning sensation, thirst, hunger), only that you wouldn't die the second time.\n\nWhen your soul is at Hell, you don't have strength at all to save yourself. \n\nDEMONS\nHell is full of demons which looks like a very deformed humanoid of up to 12-13 ft tall. Their limbs are like one is longer and the other one is shorter. Some have big heads, others are small. Some has longer torso, others have longer legs, and so on...\nDemons are ignorant, all they know is hatred to humankind (souls). Which resembles God's likeness. They are unimaginably strong. They don't have mercy, so whenever they see a soul, what they do best is to tear it apart in agony (senses are keener, remember?)\n\nStench\nThe stench in Hell is like all of the bad odors combined (rotten eggs or foods, decaying carcasses, feces, sulphur, etc.) multiplied by 1000. It is terrible, very very horrendous, and to think that our senses are much much keener. If a body went to Hell, it would've died. But no body can go there except for soul, which cannot die. The stench alone will make you long for death, but death will not come for you are already dead.\n\nDarkness and sounds\nHell has a very very pitch black surrounding. None can be seen on earth of such a dark place. There was a blackness that you couldn't even imagine. All you'll hear from hell is the sound of screaming, billions of people screaming in that place. A scream of anguish, torture, very loud ang penetrating. You can't get away from that screams, you'll have to endure it forever 'cause there's no way out from Hell. No hope, no salvation, non-ceasing.\n\nFear in Hell\nOn surroundings alone you'll feel fear, from the sound and smell and darkness. But Hell alone without what mentioned above can make you feel fear. It grips you. Its like seeing a very scary movie at its climax then take that and multiply it to a thousand and hold it there, that is how you stay all the time! This is another thing that you'll endure forever in Hell. For there's no escape.\n\nHeat\nThe heat was so intense, it could kill your body a mile away but you don't die in Hell. The fire in there is your only but terrible light. It's too hot but at the same time its too dim. Not enough to decrease the darkness around.\n\n\nThere's no rest, no hope, and all fear, eternal torture, and shame in Hell. Not even a fool "

A protein has been identified. we have info on what cells express this protein. We also know at what stage of the cell cycle the protein is expressed.how can we identify the receptor of this protein?
label the known protein with a radioactive isotope, or better yet, maybe you could label the protein with a flourescent dye (dont know how, its beyond my expertise) and where ever the protein binds on the receptive cell may be what you're looking for.  but i dont know of any assays per se for it."

2,"able for time travel?
Is it possible for time travel if you go fast enough or would it just slow time down.
So far time dilation is possible in the forward direction. That is if YOU travel away from earth in a very fast spaceship near the speed of light then turn around and come back. The people on earth would age more then you have. YOUR clock would be different then those people on earth. It would be faster.\n\nGoing backward in time is still up there.\n\nThere are many experiments that prove this to be true. Atomic clocks capable of high accuracy are sync up. One is put on a plane and flown around the earth at high speeds for a long time. When the two clocks were compared later, they showed a difference, a very small difference but a difference none the less.\n\nTake a look at this website. There are plenty of other site out there.\n\nhttp://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/050225a.html\n\nInterestingly, if you did travel at the speed of light, you would be anywhere and everywhere all at once... WOW! That blows my mind.    :-)"
2,"Daughter doing a project on how the Dinosaurs became extinct.  She is in 2nd grade & has to develop a theory?
She has come up with the theory that the volcanoes erupting were what actually ended up killing most of the dinosaurs after the asteroid hit.  Now I read a new theory that scientists think that there were two asteroids 300,000 years apart and it was the second one that finally finished them off.  Any scientists out there who can give us their imput on how the dinosaus became extinct?  Theories only, please...because she has to learn how to compare her theory with that of other scientists theories.  Don't think they made ME do this in 2nd grade...GEEESH!
I have 2 theories for you. Yes the dinosaurs died when an asteroids hit the earth.\nFirst theory: The impact or blast killed the dinosaurs. We can speculate that the dinosaurs are only living in one continent. So when the asteroid hit earth the impact and blast isntantly killed the dinosaurs. We could also say that the radius of blast was thousands of kilometers.\nSecond Theory: After impact (like in bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), there were formation of very thick clouds that even light cannot pass through (just like in animatrix). Because light cannot pass through there were no photosysthesis. Because of no photosysthesis, there is no production of food. Especially for primary food chain, protozoans, heavily dependent on sunlight to produce food of their own."
2,"a nurse works in radaitation treatment for cancer patients and she has a walkie talkie?
What are the two types of waves and are they dangerous?why?\nI think they are radio waves-walkie talkie and gamma waves-radaitation for cancer.
Refer to an electromagnetic spectrum.\nRadiation is emission and propagation and emission of energy in the form of rays or waves (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q...\nIn other words as long as waves travel there is radiation.\nThere are two types of radiation, the ionizing (harmful) radiation and the non-ionizing (not harmful) radiation.\nYou can see it in a magnetic spectrum. High frequency and low wavelength are those ionizing radiation. High wavelenth and low frequency are those non-ionizing radiation. Penetration of these waves are dependent on their frequencies. High frequencies are able to tranmsmit objects.\nFrom the magnetic spectrum there are different kinds of waves, (from non-ionizing to ionizing) radiowaves, microwaves, infrared, white light, UV, x-rays, gamma rays cosmic rays. These waves travel in a straight line unless scattered by hitting an object or being blocked or interrupted or you know I mean.\nThat's why astronomers detect radiowaves from the outerspace."

Hmm, I don't rent but you should check out http://www.realestate.com.au/ for rentals. Unfortunately, the cheaper you go, the scummier the area. If you are studying at Uni or TAFE they may be able to help you find accommodation. \nTAFE: http://www.tafesa.edu.au/Students/Accommodation/tabid/655/Default.aspx\nUNI:http://www.adelaide.edu.au/accommodation/\nhttp://www.unisa.edu.au/accommodation/\nThey are the two main unis in Adelaide. You could also ring real estate agents in the areas you would like to live in. Student noticeboards often have advertisements for share accommodation so that could be an option too. \nWhen I was looking at renting a while ago, I found you could get a reasonable apartment with 1 or 2 bedrooms about 10 minutes out of the city for about $150 a week, depending on which suburb you're looking in. You could probably find cheaper, but I didn't want to live in a crappy area. I hope that helps a bit, Good luck : )"

It is the basic truth of all existence.\n    WOMAN for me as a man is Wonders Of Motherhood's Absolute Nature. SHE for me is Supreme Heavenly Earth. If GOD is to be found then it is only through this relationship which every religion has failed to communicate as true word of GOD'S LOVE for every particle.

3,"What's a good workout to get rid of love handles?

For starters, don't do abdominal exercises as a way to ""target"" the body fat in your obliques.  Working the muscle beneath stored fat does NOTHING to the fat on top of the muscle.  In addition, crunches, sit-ups, side-bends, and other flexion-based exercises are a terrible way to work you abs in the first place.  They re-enforce terrible movement patterns, create chronically shortened muscles, don't train any functional strength that you'll actually be able to use in real life, and involve repetetive flexion of the spine which leads to degeneration of the vertabrae and discs over time.  Stick with functional, stability-based training like planks, side-planks, floor bridges, and compound lifts that force your abdominals to stabilize (like squats, unsupported rows, overhead pressing, single-leg work, etc.).  You'll be FAR better off.\n\nThe only way to lose that fat is to reduce your overall body fat percentage.  You have to clean-up your diet: \n1.  Eat every 2-4 hours throughout the day (starting with breakfast).\n2.  Get lean, complete protein with every meal.\n3.  Eat LOTS of green veggies and fruits.\n4.  Eat complex carbs early in the day and after exercise.\n5.  Eat healthy fats with the rest of your meals (yes, even a few hours from bedtime!).\n6.  Stay hydrated at all times.\n\nYou also need to lift weights a few times per week (fairly heavy), and perform regular cardio sessions (30-40 minutes is pretty good, 3+ times per week).\n\nThat's a pretty simplistic explanation, and is far from a comprehensive approach, but it should get you started."

as i can remember there are only a few study in that topic but not yet proven in a large scale.\nbut 1 thing i know is that snakes feel it first. How?\nBecause they live underground.\nyou see earthquake is a seismic activity beneath the surface. they travel in waves. and when i say they travel.\nbecause snake lives underground they feel the waves first even if the waves are weak. but if the waves gets stronger and stronger they leave their homes.\na good example of these is water in a tub. like a bath tub if you cause a seismic activity or knock or hit at one end of the tub, there are ripples that represents these waves. if you hit the tub harder you will produce a bigger ripples. \njust like in quakes, weak waves are first detected then higher and higher. \nhope you got what i meant."

if it is... what may be the causes of such?
2 more common reasons why a women might not ovulate:\n1. pregnancy\n2. weight: \n- once your weight/percentage body fat drops under a certain level, your body stops ovulating (since there obviously must be a famine going on, it wouldn't be good reduce one's chances for survival by having a baby just now). Low weight and weight loss is also associated with ovulatory dysfunction and thus infertility. Even a moderate weight loss of 10-15% under ideal body weight can result in menstrual irregularity. It does not need to be the weight alteration of 30% or more as seen in women with anorexia nervosa or bulimia.\n- Obesity has a strong association with infertility and menstrual irregularities."
1,"Is this site an effective witnessing tool for any belief?
For those of religious affiliation, or any kind of view, is this site a good way to spread spirituality, religion, beliefs, even sway moral decisions, etc.?
My impression from the Christians on this site (myself included) is that we are trying to at least clear up the confusion about Christianity and the Bible, but whether or not anyone is interested I can't say. \n\n My personal feeling is that if you're going to reject something, say Christ, you should at least know about what you're rejecting.  Some people do understand and reject what the Bible says, but most don't understand at all and have all kinds of pre-conceived notions that they've learned from the culture at large."

I was recently hospiltalized for suicidal thoughts, severe depression, and extreme anxiety in public. I've always had these diseases but they worsended when I tried to take Wellbutrin to control it. The psychiatrist I seen basically told me I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar, ADHD, and OCD. Well he did not exactly say this but I told him that I was diagnosed with ADHA when I was 16 (i'm 26 now) and told him I would feel more controlled if I were on Adderrol again. He also prescribed me Prozac for my depression and my 'OCD' as he put it. And finally I was prescribed Klonopin for my severe anxiety and insomnia. He had me fill out forms for the boderline and bipolar and I had every symptom of those as well. The medication is helping except the klonopin makes me sleepy and he wants me to take on after breakfast. My question: have you ever hear of or know anyone taking this combo of drugs and is it possible for one to have all the disorders mentioned previously? Any advice?
When you go to the hospital they throw medicine at you to make you ""better"" without knowing if it's going to work for you. I suggest that you find a phsychiatrist that you feel comfortable with and have them help you with drug combinations that work for you. Borderline can't be treated with drugs but bipolar can be treated, as can anxiety, and depression so you might be able to find a drug for all three in just one pill. Go see someone you feel safe with and get their help."

in 2003 I had a car accident and steering wheel was pushed into my stomach so hard that I had to have a plastic cage around my stomach where hernia repairs were done years ago, they were both damaged beyond repair, both upper and lower. ever since I cannot eat regularly and not run and run and run. It is so embarassing, I almost need to take a change of clothing to be able to go out to eat, in fact it doesn't happen very often.  At home the same thing, it doesn't matter if it's cereal and toast or a fried egg or what it is. Anti-diaheeral tablets are the only thing and then you get the other problem, can anyone help with a suggestion, I've taken pepto, and all that stuff with no avail and I just get to the point that I don't want to eat anything just knowing what is going to happen, doctors just say, live with it.
Have you seen a specialist about this problem?  I would make an appointment with one if I was you.  I guess it would be like a gastrointestinal doctor.  You could have something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea.  There are medications for something like that.  I am not a doctor, but I would definitely continue to go to them until one can help you.  Good luck!"
1,"dose Islam say you must follow it or is it enough to believe in one creator?
According to Islam are Christians, Jews, Deists and others that hold that there is one true creator of the universe, but do not accept Mohamed as a prophet. Are they punished for it? Is it ok for them to continue their practice? And if so then why do Muslims try to convert so many people
According to Islam, Jew and Christians are ""people of the book"". We believe in the same prophets as Jew and Christians but in Islam, Jesus did not die. Allah changed the face of an evil man so that it resembles Jesus and he was crucified instead.And the real prophet Isa (Jesus) was brought to Allah. back to your question. You have to convert to Islam. You cant just believe in one God. If it was like that, then there would be no difference between Jews, Christians and Muslims. Everyone would go to heaven. You have to become fully Muslim. According to Islam, Christians have gone astray and Jew have have earned the wrath of Allah.\nMuslims try to convert people because if they dont, the non believers and their future generations could go to hell. It is a duty for a Muslim to preach the religion ."

1,"Why are girls more easily insulted than boys?
When a girl is insulted, it shows. I saw a girl mouth off after getting splashed with water. I also saw another girl's face become very red after getting insulted by boys(it was scary to).
Guys more commonly use insults as a way of communicating with each other. Girls are more likely to use insults as a way of hurting or attacking people they are angry at. Words are the tools girls use in a fight. They are therefore more inclined to interpret insults as a personal attack on them. Girls who have grown up with brothers, especially older brothers, are much cooler about this because they understand the guy insult thing and may even do it themselves."

You are shadowing a nurse in the emergency room of a local hospital. An orderly wheels in a patient who has been in a very serious accident and has had severe bleeding. The nurse quickly explains to you that in a case like this, the patient's bed will be tilted with the head downward to make sure the brain gets enough blood. She tells you that, for most patients, the largest angle that the bed can be tilted without the patient beginning to slide off is 32.0 degrees from the horizontal.\n\na. on what factor does this angle of tilting depend?\nb. find the coefficient of static friction between a typical patient and the bed's sheets.\n\nThis problem is giving me trouble.\nPlease help me to understand it.\n\nPlease mark each part to the question to avoid confusion.
a) 1. friction coefficient\n2. whether the bead is tilted as a whole or some portion of it. if a portion then you need to know mass distribution of patient and where the bent in the bead is.\n\nb) assuming the bead is tilted as whole then F_friction=mu*mg*cos(32deg) ,ie a projection of force due to gravity onto the normal axis.\nthe friction force is balanced by the projection of force of gravity to surface: mg*sin(32deg),\nequate the two, then you get mu=tan(32deg)=0.625"

A garden is in the shape of a sq.  the lenght  of one side is increased by 3 ft and the length of the adjacent side is increased by 2 ft.  The garden now has an area of 72 sq ft. What is the measure of a side of the original sq garden?
I hope you made a start.  Since you're asked the original side measure, let that equal x ft.  Then read the question again and notice that the length of the increased garden is x + 3, and the width is ...?

Keep it up and your liver will show signs of cirrhosis. It will swell noticeably and harden.\nIt's not an attractive condition to suffer from.

2,"What is the difference between Cirrus clouds and stratus clouds.?
i need to draw pictures of each one how can I make it distinct which ones which?
CIRRUS CLOUDS \n– high-level, wispy clouds. The name originates from the Latin word meaning ""curl of hair"". These feathery clouds form very high up in the sky (at altitudes between 5 km and 14 km) where it is very cold.They are thin clouds.   And look like horse tails They are therefore made up of tiny ice crystals rather than water droplets. Cirrus clouds occur in warm air which is being slowly lifted over a large area by an approaching cold front, and they are therefore often the signal of bad weather. ............................................................................................ \n \n\n                                              STRATUS CLOUDS\n– low-level blankets of cloud. The name ""stratus"" means ""layers"" in Latin, although you in fact rarely see the layers in stratus clouds. Instead they appear as a grey, shapeless sheet of cloud extending in all directions across the sky. They are usually only about 1 km thick, but can be as much as 1000 km wide. Stratus clouds build up when a layer of warm, moist air rises slowly over a mass of colder air. These clouds are often dark and gloomy, and are associated with rain and drizzle. Stratus clouds can sometimes rest on the ground or sea instead of up in the air, and they are then called ‘fog’."

3,"What were Gilda Radners ovarian cancer symptoms?

Ovarian cancer is somewhat silent in terms of symptoms. I recommend you visit the Gilda Radner Foundation for a list of symptoms: http://www.ovariancancer.com/info.asp. \n\nIf you have any sense of having the symptoms, please visit a doctor immediately. If that doctor does not take you seriously, then see another one. Many doctors will treat women like it's all in their head...as if they're just depressed or lonely or some other BS like that.\n\nOvarian cancer is very hard to detect and will require the doctor to spend a lot of time ""feeling around"" the abdomen. The doctor most likely will need to explore the abdomen by inserting a hand into both the vagina and rectum. X-rays and MRI's often show nothing, because the ovaries are located deep in the abdomen. Also most ovarian cancers are of the epithelial type--which mean they grow flat like skin. Hence there can be an absence of a large mass or tumor, as many people imagine when the think of cancer.\n\nBe sure to visit the ""links"" page at the Gilda Radner site. It has an extensive list of additional resources on ovarian cancer: http://www.ovariancancer.com/links.asp. There's a lot of good information online."

Like if someone who belongs to a different religion brings up an interesting point in answer to one of your religion questions or gives the best and most information, do you ever choose that person for best answer?\n\nOr do you only choose people who have the same point of view as you?
Many people who post a question are not seeking an answer. often they just seeking confirmation or trying to make a point. they are going to choose accordingly.\n\ni have voted for answers other than mine. when answers were really good. but many of my best answers are somewhat matching questioner's view. \n\none of questioners wrote a comment after choosing my answer as best yesterday . he  stated that he was accused of being the same person as me. though it was ridiculous accusation. any one who paid any attention would have found out that he is not even indian like i am. he has a christian background and i am hindu. But it shows often the views of questioner and best answerer are quite similar. \n\nBut i can not generalise. i was chosen as best once or twice even when i totally opposed questioner. \n\nI think people when sincerly seeking answers choose what appeals to their logic. people when have an agenda choose views similar to their own."
7,"When you apply online for credit and you get a further processing required response is that the same as denial

Not necessarily. The computer can only check numbers: things like your income, how many other credit accounts you have, how many other people have looked at your credit report, your credit score, etc. The ""further processing required"" message could mean lots of things. Perhaps the information isn't good enough for an ""automatic"" approval but will go to a human for a final decision. Maybe there was some reason it couldn't get your credit information right away. And yes, maybe they don't want to tell you that you were denied right away.

I mean like chewing tobacco? I've been doing it for about 6 years and want to stop. I chew normally about 3x a day but if I drink its a lot more and lately its been a lot more because I found out I couldn't play tennis this year because I tore my ACL. Any tips?
I recommend using an alternative to the tobacco.  There are products out there that are meant to help you stop.  If you use snuff (Copenhagen, Skoal, etc.) you should try Hooch Snuff.  You can get it at http://www.hoochsnuff.com/.  It feels the most like real tobacco and will help you get out of the use of real tobacco.  If you use chew (Redman, etc.) it is a little more difficult as there are few products out there that can really mimic the tobacco.  \n\nOverall use of an herbal substitute (without nicotine) will reduce your withdrawl symptoms, but not the cravings for a dip / chew.  That will only take time.   Using nicotine replacement through herbal substitutes with nicotine, nicotine gum or patch, do not have as good a success rate as just plain herbal."

1,"Isn't the state of Zen peace actually indifference masked?
The drab black and white yin/yang wipes out all the colour in life. No thought, no emotion. No emotion, no passion for life.
Zen is paradoxically the cultivation of non-cultivation, recognizing that we need only remove the illusion of non-enlightenment to become enlightened.\nOne of the central points of Zen is intuitive comprehension. When we come to realize the fundamental nature of Mind, Zen becomes super-logical.\nOn the other hand, when we attempt to examine the nature of Mind through emotions, ego-pain, mental pictures, and discursive ideas based on sense perception, Zen seems like nonsense.\nBecause everything arises from Mind, Mind cannot be measured through its creations because the latter are not as perfect as Mind itself. On the other hand, directly coalescing with Mind everything makes perfect sense just as they are--as they arise from Mind. All things thus reveal the pure function of Buddha Mind. Just so, we see the natural world as a manifestation of the cosmic Buddha.\nWhen the Zen master Joshu wipes crumbs off his robe he is demonstrating the primordial power of Mind to move his body perfectly--although he is no longer attached to his body, now being Mind."

moving in the same speed:forces and motions.
This is due to relative velocity. It's a great concept...it's the same concept which applies to you sitting at your desk..believe it or not...the earth you are situated on is revolving at the rate of once everyday..but do you feel it?? Nope...that is because you are revolving with it at the same speed. The formula for relative velocity is Vu-Vo where Vu is your speed and Vo is the speed of the other car..since they are the same, you subtract and voila..you get zero..therefore the car appears to be moving at zero speed in your vision. Check out relative velocity on GOogle..its a fun topic and your question is the fundamental base to relativity...Wow huh??\n\nGood luck.\n\nAyerhs\n\nPS: it is most definitely not because they have it on cruise control..I mean they could if they wanted but thats not the reason that they seen stationary to you."

2,"Why in the FIFA world cup we see the flag of the England and not of the GreatBretain ? What is the difference?
Because at the United Nation, the GreatBretain have a place and not England, i think. Thank You
First of all, you have to differ between the United Kingdom and Great Britain. Nowadays, the United Kingdom is composed of Great Britain plus Northern Ireland. Great Britain itself is composed of England, Scotland and Wales. The country represented at the United Nations is the United Kingdom as a whole, not just Great Britain.\n\nThe football players play in separate teams because this is sports and not politics. In association football, England has a separate team from that of Scotland and that of Wales. This is why you see the flag of England when there's a football game and the flags of Scotland and Wales when those two other teams play.\n\nBy the way, their football clubs also play in separate leagues."

Is it right that Quran already prophecized 1400 years ago regarding  the discovery of phaoroah body in 1898? plz give me references
YES RIGHT! Quran has several fulfilled prophecies. its one of them. \n\nStory of pharaoh that his body will be made example for everyone. then his body found in 19th century. In the Qur’an we find that God promised to preserve the body of the Pharaoh as a sign for later generations (see Qur’an 10:90-92).True to the Qur’anic promise, the mummified body of the Pharaoh was discovered by Loret in 1898 at Thebes in the Kings’ Valley (see The Bible, the Qur’an and Science by Dr. Maurice Bucaille, p. 238). From there it was transported to Cairo. Elliot Smith removed its wrappings on July 8, 1907 and gave a detailed description in his book entitled the Royal Mummies (1912).\nFrom which source did the author of the Qur’an derive this information? How did the author of the Qur’an know that the Pharaoh’s body was preserved whereas the knowledge that the ancient Egyptians mummified their dead was not discovered until recently? And how could the author of the Quran predict that the body of the Pharaoh will be discovered later, unless the author was God Himself?\n\nAnother comparison will again demonstrate that the Qur’an was not copied from the Bible. In the Bible we are told that God drowned the Pharaoh and his army when they pursued Moses, on whom be peace, and his people (see Exodus 14:28). The clear indication in that description is that the body of the Pharaoh perished in the sea. However, the Qur’an dared to differ and prove true. In the Qur’an we find that God promised to preserve the body of the Pharaoh as a sign for later generations (see Quran 10:90-92)."

In recent years I have been hearing the latest runors that they have uncovered evidence that may show that Christ had a woman in his life and had children. This floored me!\nSo, any truth to these acusations and where would I find it out at?
Yeah, it's the DaVinci Code. Dan Brown, the author, uses just enough truth mixed in with his fiction to make what he says believable. Most people don't know enough about the Bible to know that what he's saying is false, and so they accept it because he's a good writer."

I have oliy face but rest of my body is dry which cause itching problem all over my body can I apply Olive oil on my Itching part of my body
Olive oil is really good:\n\nskin: it moistens the skin, but is sorta oily when you sweat... i reccomend baby oil and lotion instead. put a little baby oil on your body first, then add a layer of baby lotion over it. it really works! well... it works for me...\n\nhair: it softens yr hair like a super conditioner, but takes a long time to wash off. a good way to soften your hair is to mix a raw egg with olive oil and apply onto hair. leave it for half n hr and wash of with cold water;. try it and yr hair will be shiny and really soft. this is a method that people in china use to keep their hair from drying and losing its shine and natural oil in China, during winter."

I'm 31 and used to work as a male nurse but I gave it up because I didn't like it.Now I've been looking for a job for some time but am not able to find anything.Should I get back to my previous job that I didn't like or wait for who knows how long?The problem is that I'm fed up with staying at home but I really don't know what to do and am really depressed.
Is it that you didn't like taking care of people or you didn't like who you worked with or for? I am in Human Services and work collaboratively with a lot of nurses who have frequently changed jobs over the years, but have found a niche that they particularly like better than others. Some like the emergency/ hospital type thing, some the mental health/hospital thing, others like in home nursing, some like elder care/ nursing homes, and others like to work with children in homes or in a school, ect. Nursing is such a diverse field I'd think you could find something to do with your knowledge/education that you would enjoy. I too am 31 and have felt this same way in the past. I now have a job doing the same thing I was doing before, but for a new company and it has made all the difference. I realized I did like what I was doing for a living but I didn't like it at 3 agencies before I came to this one. And well, maybe it is time to move on to some thing new. I can't really answer this for you, but if you were a good nurse (which I'm sure you were), I'd hope you'd stick with it because there aren't enough good ones out there."

Of course there are. \n\nYou should find out first what you're good at and like to do, then make some kind of a plan (how long will I work, where and how do I approach people) then just go out there and do it! \n\nThere are many examples I could give you but for instance if your good on the computer you could offer (older) people to help them on theirs, maybe they have viruses they don't know how to remove, or they'd like to send and email but don't know how to. (I guess you know how to handle (simple) computer tasks.)\n\nMake sure you have some kind of fee (don't be too drastic!) and put this on paper (make a nice flyer offering your services and price list)\n\nHope you make a lot of money this summer and have lots of fun doing it!"
3,"Will i lose all the weight i have after having my daughther?
I just had a baby and i have tried everything to lose the weight is there anything i can do to lose it?
You cannot lose weight overnight.  The first thing to do is to go on a diet that will fit your lifestyle. I tried the South Beach Diet and during the first two weeks I lost 7 lbs.  I have been on this diet for one year and so far I have lost 30 lbs. I have combined it with exercises like biking or brisk walking in the malls for 30 moinutes after office hours, at least 3 times a week."
3,"Can you help me lose weight?
I'm 40 years old, 5'4"" and 145 lbs. I've been working out four times a week for 2 months and I've only lost 4 lbs. Clothes are getting loose, I am losing inches. It's just not coming off fast enough. I'm eating healthier but not necessarily less and I don't want too.
Don't pay anyone to lose weight. This is what you need to do.\n\n1. Lift Weights - muscle burns calories and \ngives you tone. \n\n2. Track Calories...sort of- You don't need to track calories like an owl. But if you center every meal around ... lets say 300 calories. You can safely eat 5 meals a day. \n\n3. Eat 5-6 meals a day- Keep your body burning fat all the time. When you don't eat, your body turns off and burns less calories. If you eat all the time then you are always burning fat. \n\n4. Eat less sugar- low calorie diets are high in sugar and bad carbs. Eat less than 100 carbs a day (don't count fiber!) and the fat will melt off. Remember don't have more than 20 percent of your calories come from fat. 1 fat gram is 9 calories. 1 protein and 1 carb gram are 4 calories. So on a 1500 calorie diet. You should not be eating over 34grams of fat. \n\n5. Do cardio 5-6 days a week- remember cardio after weight lifting. \n\n6. Drink a lot of water. 1/2 gallon a day\nHope that helps."

3,"What should I do?
I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder almost a year ago and have tried several medications that have not helped. I am currently not on any meds and I am not doing so good. My mood swings and my manic episodes are completely out of control. I've tried Depakote, Lamictal, Prozac, Serequel, Resperidal, Zyprexa and a few others. Right now the only thing I'm taking is Xanax xr for my anxiety and insomnia which helps tremendously. I just moved to a new town and am not able to see a doctor until my insurance gets switched over and I don't know how long that will take. I feel like I am going crazy here, I need help now not a month from now. What am I supposed to do?
Hi - some of those meds you mentioned can take a while before you get to feel any positive effect from them. I know a few people who take meds for bi-polar, and each one told me about the time factor, and each one needs to take something different. \nI don't know if you've ever tried meditation or anything spiritual, but if you are open-minded, you can find a LOT of books that can help you, as well as self-help support groups which can give you some input (you'll need to contact some counseling service or look in the phone book to find them). \nIf your situation gets really bad, you may need to go to the emergency room at your local hospital (if you're contemplating some drastic action, they HAVE to help you); just take the insurance that you had from where you used to live. That should be enough for a hospital to use until your coverage gets switched over (even smaller hospitals have staff specialists that know how to deal with the money issue).\nGood Luck!"

Go to the health food store and buy the yogurt that has enzymes especially for women/yeast infenctions.  There is also a body cleanse for this.  HOWEVER, always dicuss this kind of thing with your doctor or a certified nutritionist.  Provided you are not in reproductive danger or in the midst of an infenction give it a try and see if the recurrance rate lessens.  Make sure with the cleanse you read carefully as some medications and conditions contraindicate it use.

(I have to disagree with the previous answer - f doesn't have to be monotonic).\n\nSuppose the contrary. Any infinite subset of [0,1] contains at least one limit point in [0,1] so let p be a limit point of the set of zeros of f. It's not to hard to see that both f(p) and f'(p) are zero, contrary to the assumption. To be explicit:\n\nSuppose f(p)=a is not zero. Since f is continuous, there must be some open interval such that for every x in the interval: |f(x)-a| < epsilon = |a| ==> impossible since every open interval containing p contains zeros of f.\n\nSuppose f'(p)=b is not zero.

I've done both of them.  Each of them was successful (though I gained the weight back within 3-5 years - which is why I needed to try both!).  Which is better depends on you.  \n\nWeight Watchers is healthier, because it teaches you to make good choices.  Thus, even after you finish, you can still put what you learned to use to maintain your goal weight.\n\nBut Jenny Craig is better if you really lack self-control, because you don't have to make as many choices -- you just eat the food they give you.\n\nDon't worry too much about which one to choose -- just get started!"

1,"Can anyone who has ""seen"" The Devil in the flesh explain to me what they saw?
Occasionally I run across posts where people indicate that they have seen The Devil in the flesh. \n\nI am admittedly skeptical of such claims (to put it mildly.)\n\nWith that disclaimer out of the way, I'm very curious to know what exactly you saw.\n\nI'm not talking about people who have metaphorically seen the devil in drug addiction or Charles Manson. I'm talking about people who claim to have seen The Devil in the flesh.\n\nI'm curious as to what he looked like, did, said, everything.\n\nIf you're willing to enlighten me, I'm willing to listen.
I will try to explain to you…\n\nFirst of all… the devil is a spirit creature… and is not thrice in structure as a human being is.  A human being is soul, body, and spirit.  Therefore saying “the devil in the flesh” is not a good way to describe such.\n\nFallen celestials are no longer ‘perfect beings’ because fallen angels gained a ‘fallen nature’ after falling from grace.  Being a spirit… a fallen angel’s form is nothing like that of a human being or an animal’s form, etc.\n\nSpirits are physically around… but their nature as spirits is extremely different from anything that the human being normally sees around.  People just try to get around this difficultly by saying that they are ‘spiritual’.  So, basically to the human being in the common mindset… celestial beings are very alien to us.  They are so unearthly and have such unfamiliar forms, that… to see one physically… as one would see another human… it can strike fear into an individual.  Nevertheless… no one should fear a mere creature.\n\nIt is hard to describe unearthly things in language that can be well understood.  Basically… seeing a fallen angel ‘can’ be just like seeing George W Bush.  You can see Bush, hear him, or even touch him… because he is actually real.  Actually seeing a fallen angel is not something in the mind.  Just as Bush is real… so are fallen angels.\n\nFallen angels can be:  seen, heard (as you would hear another human being), smelt, touched, and sensed.\n\nThe below information is copied from a website:  (it is a description of Satan in one of his two forms… being a spirit he shifts).\n_____________________________________________\nILLUSTRATION OR ANALYSIS OF FORM\nDESIGNED TO CLARIFY MISUNDERSTANDINGS\n\nDifferences from the human form\n\nHeylel’s form includes different textures that are of fallen angelic nature, wings \nthat withdraw or retract into his back, a tail with spade tip, another joint (extra part \nto the leg) from the shin, then ankles and cloven hooves.  Although, commonly \ndepicted as having claws or horns, he has neither in his humanoid form.  Heylel \nalso has a nictitating membrane (that can move across the eye) as a lizard or a cat.\n\nHeight and Weight\n\nIn Heylel’s humanoid form, his height is 5’6”.  The angelic being’s standard \nweight changes because they are spirit beings.\n\nSkin, leather and fur colorization, etc\n\nHeylel’s skin colorization is a shiny, light white.  The creature’s fur fades from \nblond – to a dark (copper/reddish) brown – being variegated in a usually unkempt \nmatter.  Heylel’s fur tends to shed as flying dust, no doubt showing that he is \ncursed.  Hair or fur in this type of condition indicates an unhealthy state.  He has \nfur from his waist down, in length, much like a long-haired cat.  Heylel’s wings \nand his tail have a leather-like skin, not scales, the leather shades from red to a \ndarker red.  The bones of his wings are covered in a black leather skin.  The \ncreature’s cloven hooves are much like the natural colorization of a cow’s hoof.\n\nFacial features\n\nHeylel has blond spiky hair.  He has a beard (the imperial beard), and very light \nblue eyes – that seem to reflect.  The creature has a wound (or scar) on the top-\nright side of his head.  At times, the wound has a yellowish substance that exudes \nand becomes incrusted on his head.  When yellowish the creature smells rotten.  \nHe also has a scar above the right eye.\n\nWings\n\nHeylel’s wings look strange.  They appear to be, as if they were bat wings.  \nHowever, the creature most likely had feathered wings in the beginning.   They are \nmade of a hallowed bone structure with a thin layer of tightly stretched leather-like \nskin other the bones.  You could see shades of light though the stretched skin.\n\nOther features\n\nHeylel has a tumor on the outer side of his right shin.\n_____________________________________________\n(Article ends he"

Gold is seldom found in its raw form, usually it's an ore, together with other metals etc. After mining this ore, it needs to be processed, usually it is ground to small bits and then treated chemically, but there are other ways, too.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have gold in the form we know and value. Even so, since gold is such a soft metal, it is usually sold in alloy form, with silver, copper, platin, palladium or other metals. This also gives it its color, which can range from red, to silver-white, golden, green or even blue."

all about typhoon
A typoon is the same thing as a hurricane. Basically whichever basin it is in determines whether it is caused a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone. In the west Pacific they are called typhoons. So when you here of a typhoon hitting Japan or Australia, it's basically the same as a hurricane. In the Northern hemisphere, a typhoon circulates counter-clockwise, in the southern hemisphere, it goes clockwise.\n\nA typhoon starts out the same way as a hurricane- usually an area of low pressure gets organized and starts drawing its energy from the heat of condensation. If the conditions are right (warm water current, no sheering winds aloft), it can organize more and become a typhoon with winds in excess of 75 mph.\n\nYou can get more about tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) and pictures here:\n\nhttp://www.weatherunderground.com/tropical/"

using the formula for n^th term of arithmetic sequence, what is 101st term? using the formula for sum in arithmetic what is the sum of the frist 20 terms?  what is the sum of the first 30 terms?
In an arithmetic sequence, the formula for the nth term is\n\ninitial term + (common difference times (n-1))\n\nIn other words, you start with a number and keep adding the same number to that original number. In the sequence you gave (the odd numbers) the first number is 1 and you keeping adding 2. (The reason why the nth term is 1 + (n-1)2 is that you started adding 2 with the second term.)\n\nso the 101st term of that sequence would be\n\n1 + (100)2 = 201\n\nThe sum of the sequence, also known as an arithmetic series, has its  own formula:\n\nSum = (initial term + last term)*n/2\n\nThis comes out of the fact that if you add the first and last term, the result will be the same as adding the second and second-to-last term, which will be the same as adding the third and the third-to-last term, etc.\n\nSo for 20 terms of the sequence above, the first term is 1, the 20th term is 1+(2)19=39 and the sum of the sequence is (1+39)*20/2=400.\n\nI'll leave it up to you to do the sum of the first 30 terms.\n\nHope that helps."

1,"What goes on at your worship services?
I am unfamiliar with the worship services of non-Catholic faiths.  Please tell me what faith you practice and give a brief outline of what happens at a typical worship service.
The following is quoted from a tract titled, ""What to Expect When You Visit the Church of Christ"", written by Calvin Barber. \n\nPerhaps you have heard of the church of Christ through advertisement or by special invitation from its members. Maybe there is a building in your community where the church of Christ meets, and you have considered attending one of their worship services. But you have put it off simply because of the dread of going to a strange place, not knowing what to expect. May we briefly introduce ourselves and let you know what to expect when you visit us.\n\nFRIENDLINESS\n\nYou can expect a warm, friendly welcome.\n\nFriendliness is a natural response of a Christian. We believe that one of the basic foundation principles of Christianity is love and friendship toward our fellowman. \n(Mt. 22:36-40) True Christianity recognizes no sex, social or racial differences. \n(Gal. 3:28) Neither does it permit respect of persons on the basis of poverty or wealth. (Jas. 2:1-9) Jesus is our superb example in friendliness, in that he was compassionate toward all humanity, regardless of their status in life. We believe you will find that same spirit among Christians today. Therefore, when you visit us, you will be considered an honored guest. You will be greeted with kindness and courtesy. Why not give us the opportunity to become your friend? \n(Cf Prov. 18:24)\n\nORDER\n\nYou can expect our service to be with reverence and order.\n\nWe strive to engage in all worship and service with decency and order. \n(I Cor. 14:30) The order of our worship is usually planned by our elders. Each item of worship is usually announced and often briefly explained by the men who lead us in our worship. This enables each of us to know what is going on and helps us to better prepare our minds for worship. We try to avoid all extremism in worship. Neither ritualism nor emotionalism is characteristic of our worship. You can expect our worship to be spiritual, reverent and orderly.\n\nSIMPLICITY\n\nYou can expect our worship to be simple.\n\nIt's simple because it is based entirely on the worship authorized in the New Testament. Jesus taught that our worship was to be spiritual and according to truth. \n(Jn. 4:24) Our worship to God includes the Lord's supper, giving, singing, prayer and teaching the gospel. Each of these blooms with the beauty of simplicity. We do not try to improve on God's divine plan and beauty with pageantry or innovations of men. We believe you will be impressed with the simplicity of our worship.\n\nSINGING\n\nYou can expect congregational singing.\n\nSinging is a vital part of our worship. All members of our congregation will blend their voices together in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. The purpose of our songs is to praise God, to teach and admonish one another through our singing. \n(Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16) Since the command to sing is specific and addressed to the individual, we do not add a mechanical instrument of music in our worship in songs. For the same reason we do not have choirs to sing for us or any type of mood music to entertain us. Many who have visited us have been highly impressed with the beauty and spirituality involved in congregational singing. Why not come and see for yourself?\n\nGIVING\n\nYou can expect us to give a free-will offering.\n\nAs the Bible teaches, we give liberally as God has prospered us, on the first day of the week. \n(I Cor. 16:1-2) Our liberality is an evidence of our devotion to God. \n(II Cor. 8:1-8) There are many factors that determine the amount of our offerings, but above all they must be free-will offerings. \n(II Cor. 9:6-7) When the offering is taken, it is entirely the choice of our guest whether they will give an offering or not. We will not embarrass you by personally asking for an offering. Neither do we want you to feel embarrassed if you choose not to or cannot afford to give.\n\nPRAYER\n\nYou can expect our public prayers to be led by men."
1,"Does it bother you that job listings rarely tell what the income is?
Also, would you use a Free site that you could look up wages for that exact job that you looking to apply for, and would you put down what you make at your job or a previous job?
No, it doesn't bother me, although it is convenient if they post a range.  Usually only government listings do that.  I think there is enough variety in the marketplace, not only in what is expected of a given position, but what the employer will ""settle for"" once he sees who applies for a position.  The more we have set expectations for a given job title, the more trouble is created when a job does not fit the assumptions.  I am a ""legal secretary,"" and there is a large body of assumptions about what that is, what I should know, and what I should expect to be paid.  But a law firm might be huge, with lots of benefits and support staff to do a lot of the routine tasks for me, or it might be a one-lawyer office, where I am expected to do everything, even water the plants.  If there was a ""standard"" salary, or even range, for such work, they would end up having to use different definitions, or put roman numerals after the title: become more rigid and beaurocratic than they already are.  Let's leave room for a prospective employer and employee to work it out for themselves."
3,"Whats the best way to get a splinter out?
I have a splinter in my foot, and I pressed a hot washcloth against it, and put peroxide on the spot. Anything else?
Take a needle, sterlize it ( use rubbing alcohol or a lighter).  Depending on how deep the splinter is, take twezers and try to get it out.  Or you can try a needle and get under the skin,lift the skin up and tthen try to take it out.\n\nStart by washing your hands with soap and water, then washing the affected area. If one end of the splinter is sticking out of the skin, grasp it with tweezers and gently pull it out. (Remember to pull in the opposite direction from the way the object entered the skin.) Clean the area well with soap and water, and apply a bandage.\n\n\n\nIf the object is completely embedded in the skin, you'll need to enlarge the puncture in the skin through which the splinter entered, or create a small opening to reach it, using a sterilized needle or tweezers as tools. In difficult cases, you may need to visit a doctor or nurse to have this done for you. \n\nClick on the link below for more information.\n\nHappy removing!"

I've got a shop and just wondered if there was a standard mark up percentage that's used.  Some suppliers provide an RRP price but some don't so I have to trawl through ebay and other internet sites looking for similar products.  Is there a standard percentage to use?
There is no hard and fast rule, it varies tremendously by product and sector. A good starting point is to check out your competition, you don't want to discover that you have priced your goods way above your nearest competitor."

The oxygen is used for the oxidation of glucose molecules, so that they are broken down and release the energy that we need for the metabolic activities inside our body.\nFirst the glucose molecule is acted upon by enzymes which break it into 2 'chains'. The 6 carbon atoms in the chains then react with oxygen to form CO2; and simultaneously an enzyme dehydrogenase removes hydrogen atoms from the glucose molecule which then react with oxygen to form water. \nC6H1206 + 6O2 ----> 6CO2 + 6H20 + energy"

Hi there,\nBelow I have included an excerpt from my new book The Gracious Diet. This excerpt will give you a brief summarry on the metabolism.\nLet’s talk about metabolism. What is all this media hype about the metabolism? Why is it worthy of grabbing front page headlines in every fitness magazine? \nThe term metabolism, derived from the Greek language, simply means change or transformation. Our metabolism is what turns foods into energy. The higher the metabolic rate, the higher the caloric output. It is a necessary function that allows our bodies to use food and other resources to maintain the working parts, repair damage, heal injury and rid the body of toxins. In other words, metabolism is a necessary process, without which living organisms would die.\nMetabolism aids in digestive function as well as absorption of nutrients. It is most affected by nutrition, hydration and physical activity. Each of these items is an imperative aspect of optimum metabolic health. When any one of these is lacking, the metabolic rate decreases. Consequently, weight loss and weight maintenance are directly related to healthy metabolism.\nWhen does our metabolism work? Well the truth is it’s always working, even when you are sleeping. A well designed fitness program will elevate the metabolic rate. Below are nine closely guarded steps to increasing your metabolic rate.\n1. Eat protein at every meal, including breakfast.\n2. Eliminate wheat- and flour-based products for the time being. And yes, that definitely includes bread and pasta. \n3. Eat unprocessed foods. Ninety percent of what you eat should be a combination of (in this order of importance) raw vegetables, steamed vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and a few fruits. \n4. Reduce starch to one portion a day, and don't eat that portion during your evening meal. Best choices of starches are beans, sweet potatoes, and oatmeal. \n 5. Reduce or eliminate dairy for the time being, especially cow's milk. Exceptions: reasonable amounts of low sugar, fat free yogurt. \n6. Lose the booze. Despite what the ""studies"" say, you lose no health benefits by giving up alcohol (including wine). There is nothing essential in alcohol that you can't get in fruits and vegetables without all the bad side effects that go along with it. \n7. Stop using vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower and corn. The supermarket kind is highly refined, and it oxidizes easily when heated, contributing to arterial plaque. Use olive oil instead, and apply it to food after the food is cooked when possible. \n8. Watch which types of fat you're eating. The amount of fat you eat is probably less important than the kind of fat you eat. The worst are fried foods, margarine and foods that contain hydrogenised or partially hydrogenised oils. The best is omega-3, found in fish and flaxseed oil. \n9. Obsessively drink water: At least 8 ounces for every 20 pounds of bodyweight you're now carrying around, each day. Everyday. No excuses."

7,"pls, let me know is there any jobs in livermore?
qualification: high school diploma
Livermore is a pretty small community, where jobs will be focused in clusters. \n\nOne strategy is to focus on the few retail oriented positions, like at Stoneridge Mall or some other nearby places.  \n\nIf you can get to BART or have your own car, you should probably look farther afield in places like Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon or ""the Creek"". \n\nAn alternative strategy is to look for support jobs (e.g. receptionist) as there are lots of professional services in that area like doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants.  Go door to dor and you might be suprised what jobs are out there that are not advertised.  \n\nA third strategy is to start your own business. Since Livermore is more of a bedroom community and not the hotbed of retail, you may have to work for yourself.  For example, house cleaning, landscaping, car detailing, computer repair, concierge service, etc.).  \n\nHow do I know?  I grew up in that area."

2,"what is steam pipelines?

Steam pipelines are not made of steam; they carry steam!  The pipelines are usually very heavy steel pipes in a typical power plant and must have heavy duty pipe supports at intervals to support the weight.  The supports may rest on the plant's floor with the pipe above or may be suspended from a ceiling supporting the pipe below.  Because the pipes will expand and contract as the plant starts up or shuts down for maintenance the pipe supports must allow for pipe movement due to thermal growth without overstressing the pipes.  Large bends in the pipe help reduce stress.  The pipes may be subjected to ""water hammer"" if condensation collects in low points and slugs of water are permitted to dash about inside the pipe so automatic condensation drain valves must be installed at all low points.  Condensation can be minimized by installing thick insulation all along the pipe which also saves energy and improves plant efficiency.  Some steam pipes carry superheated steam which is under very high pressure and temperature.  At one power plant I visited in Boston, MA the supervisor said that a superheated steam leak was invisible and could cut a man (or woman?) in half.  It would cross a chamber, strike a wall and condense making it visible.  Then the operators could move slowly along the high catwalks raising and lowering a broom until the bristles were being cut and they could then backtrack to find the leak.  Steam pipes must be shock mounted to survive earthquakes too.  Of course there are many smaller steam pipes in the plant to support auxiliary equipment."
7,"When you are in a relationship, isn't it supposed to be give and take 50/50?
Do you think that fraction is wrong?  Should it be more 70/30?  Is there always a needier person in a relationship?
If you are keeping score its not a relationship worth having. You do what you can with what you have to work with. In some areas my significant other is much needier than I am. In other areas I am much needier than she is. We don't hold back, but give what we have to give and accept what we are offered believing that if there was more to give it would have been given and that what has been given in love should be accepted. I hope that's not confusing."
3,"What does black stool indicate?

It could mean blood is in the stool.  Black stool would inticate a upper GI bleed.  Upper because the blood has gone thru the majority of the GI system.  If it was a lower GI bleed (like starting in the large intestine) it would be more red in the stool.  Of course it may not be a bleed.  It could be caused by medication or possibly vitamins.  Too much Iron supplements can cause a black looking stool."
1,"Has Christmas Become a Joke and a Mockery?  Should It Be Celebrated Year Round and Given a Different Name?
There are two questions in one.  Capitalism has turned Christmas shopping into consumerism run amok.  What would you propose as a new name for Christmas?  The ""Christ"" in Christmas has already been removed by the capitalists.  I know some of you will argue that Christmas is a pagan holiday anyway - which is OK.\n\nLet's face it - Shops are putting up displays 2-3 months in advance.  Santa shows up after Halloween, an athiestic, demonic and Satanic holiday.  The Jews have Hanukkah where gifts are given for 8 consecutive days.  The Muslims have Eid - whatever that means other than occurring after Ramadan.  Kwanzaa was invented by a black power professor in the 1960's.
i totally agree with you on everything that you said, that is why my family celebrates the real meaning of Christmas which is Christ.  The world has so corrupted this sacred holiday that it no longer carries with it any meaning!!  the devil has done what he always does, taken Christ out and put something else in His place."

1,"Should Christians use Pascal's Wager to defend their faith?

Only if they want to be ridiculed.\n\nThe religious person says ""If I'm wrong, I have nothing to lose.  If you're wrong, you'll burn in hell"" (or some such nonsense).  Sadly for that person, this is wrong.  If you believe in the Christian god, and it's actually the Muslim god who exists, you're going to burn in hell for all eternity - the Quran says so.  If you believe in the Christian god and he's an evil sadist rather than a benevolent god (a reasonable assumption, considering the incalculable suffering that he - supposedly - presides over in the world), then he will take great delight in sending the most fervent believers to eternal torture and keeping us atheists in paradise, just to make your torment that much the worse.  If there is a god and he values reason over blind faith, he will reward atheists and punish believers (since they have no justifiable reason to believe that any gods exist).  \n\nAny genuinely religious person would spend their lives eternally tormented by the possibility of believing in the wrong god and ending up in some other hell, or offending the Christian god and ending up in his.  If you don't feel this way, then you can't be a genuine believer.\n\nAtheists, of course, have no such worries, since we know that when we die, we cease to exist.  You spend your life sweating over the prospect of burning in hell, and we'll live comfortable lives without fear of what might happen in the next life, because we know there is no such thing."

If you just refrigerate it will prolly only last a week to ten days. Freezing is best, you can always just pop it out and defrost it in the microwave if needed."

2,"are  there any other universes around ours ?

It's possible according to Brane theory.  Brane theory is a hyperdimensional theory in which all of reality consists of 11 dimensions.  In this theory, our universe is a ""membrane,"" having the physical laws and constants necessary for life as we know it to exists.\n\nIn Brane theory, there are infinite numbers of parallel ""membranes,"" or universes if you will, existing beneath visible reality.  These membranes may be incredibly like our own or so different that life as we know it can not exist because of the difference between physical laws and constants.\n\nIf brane theory holds true, then there are parallel universes that exist just beyond our reach.  There's even talk of trying to recreate the conditions of the big bang, because in theory, it would spark another universe, without affecting our own."
3,"what causes diabetes?

there are 2 types of diabetes. Type 1 also called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile diabetes mellitus. This is caused by lack of production of insulin by the pancreas. As a result, this form of diabetes presents earlier and is seen in children/teens. Type 2 DM is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is caused by lack of response of cells to the insulin hormone. Thus, in these patients, the levels of insulin maybe normal or infact even elevated as an effort by the pancreas to increase the insulin production as an effect of the lack of response to the normal insulin levels. Eventually, these patients may too end up needing insulin to control their blood sugar levels. Type 2 DM is more often seen in middle aged people. The cause for Type 1 DM is thought to be destruction of the pancreas by autoantibodies (ie, antibodies against body's own cells- in this case the pancreatic cells) and the precipitating factor is believed to be a viral infection, probably caused by a coxsackievirus. Type 2 DM is believed to have a stronger hereditary role in causation than type 1 DM."

3,"How to wrap a shoulder with an ace bandage?

Well It depends on what you are trying to do. There is no real effect by just wrapping an ace wrap on it but if you are trying to wrap a pad or something to it you can do that. Wrapping an ace wrap to a sholder is not the same as wrapping a knee with an ace wrap. If you are trying to immobolize it then i would use a sling that would work best."

7,"What is the best prepaid debit card program to use today?

The best card really depends on what you want to use the card for. \n\nIf you want a card to park money and earn some interest, look at Netspend.\n\nIf you want a card for direct deposit, look at rushcard or netspend.\n\nIf you are looking for a card as an allowance tool, look at a visa buxx card.\n\nHere are somethings to look out for:\n1. Hidden fees (some cards even charge for customer service)\n2. How long they've been business....the established cards have been around for atleast 2 years\n3. Do you need to do something extra to get the things that you need (some card put restrictions on car rentals for example)\n\nA great source is the prepaid card forum."

2,"why did people ger seasick on the Tacoma Narrows Bridges?

It was poorly designed for the area that it was built.  \n\nThe wind gusting would set up a harmonic longitudinal resonance in the bridge that caused it to ripple along it's length like waves on the ocean.  It was this effect that gave it the nickname ""Galloping Gertie"" and caused seasickness for those who used it.\n\nThe bridge eventually tore itself apart, but from a different cause which was identified as ""torsional mode"".   Basically, the bridge acted like an airfoil.  In a strong cross gust, part of the bridge began to exhibit aerodynamic lift and increased its angle of attack, then that section would reach its stall point and drop.\n\nHere's video footage of the failure, http://www.camerashoptacoma.com/narrows.asp\n\nThe wikipedia entry is very informative, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge"
1,"What benefit is there for Religion?
Morality, ethically speaking! What does religion contribute that basic life experience can not provide? Love, compassion, empathy, hate, happiness, sadness are all emotions that religion do not provide so what is its purpose?
I think you mean morality.  Anyway, religion is a means to support the ideas that gives one a reason for life.  A weakness, I say, but still a means to an end.  As well, religion gives the powers that be, especially in the past, a means of control.  Fear is your only god, and that is the message.  Don't do what we say, you suffer forever. Now that is a good selling point.  Religion is, as the quote says, the opium of the people."

7,"where can i find a lehitatmate home based job for person outside the US?
I am living in the caribbean and i would love to find a job that i can do online. No MLM or scams. Legitamate employers. I am currently in the the technical field.
Listen.  If you are out of state, and you are looking for a legitiate homebased business, you have to ask what kind of business you want to do.  Do you want to market on the internet?  Do you want to do MLM?  Do you want to do real estate?  These are all legitimate questions.  Since my background is in MLM, that is all I can advise you on with confidence.  If you are looking for a home based business in MLM or network marketing, you have to look into several things. \n1. First thing you want to do is see if a specific opportunity is licensed to work in your specific area. A great place to start is google.com or yahoo.com and place in the words home based business.  There will be plenty of home based businesses that catch you eye.  Sign up to some of their mailing list for more info, and save the ones you really like to your favorites. \n  \n2. Next, Chances are you will be forwarded to a sight that will tempt you to buy, or someone will call you, and tery to get you involved in their opportunity.  Resist all temptaion and DO NOT SIGN UP ON THE SPOT.  Even if every bone in your body tells you to, you will want to check with either the FTC, or the Better Business Bureau to see whether or not they are legitimate.  Another great place to check is with mlmwatchdog.com.  They specialize in letting people know what is or is not a scam in this specific industry. Trust me, the opportunity will still be there after you do your research.  Also, if a person tries to pressure you into an opportunity or a buy, without saying it is a good idea to research, then there is a chance it my be a scam.  \n\n3. Then, you are going to want to check on how a specific team builds their business.  You want to make sure that they have a system that you would be comfortable with.  If they are not willing to show you exactly how they build their business, or they say their system is ""top secret"" you DO NOT want to work with them (chances are they will make you build a list of friends and family, and work from there).  While there is nothing wrong with speaking to friends and family, I have found that it can be very difficult to build a massive downline using this method alone. So, you want to be sure their marketing system make since to you, and you feel confident that you can make money using this system.\n\n4. Ask if there are any additional cost in doing the business.  Remember, you do NOT want to join an opportunity that will be to expensive for you to market.\n\nOpportunities I would stay away form:\n\na.  Groundfloor opportunities:  These are usually the most unstable of opportunities to join.  you want to join something that has been around for a few years, and has gained some sort of credibility in the field.  Some guys will claim that you will not be able to build a good business in an older company, and that you need to get on before the business explodes.  THAT IS A HUGE CROCK OF BULL. There is no difference in marketing an older opportunity then there is marketing a younger, accept for the fact that you have a chance to check their credibility.  I would recommend a company that has been around for at least 8 years, and has some experienced people who can coach you on what to do to be successful.\n\nb.  Opportunities with no address or phone number on their home page:  This should be a huge red flag here.  If you cannot contact the corporate office, there is a good chance these people are not who they say they are.\n\nc.  Opportunities that say that you have to do no work:  If there is no work involved on you part, then why do they need you?  THIS SHOULD BE A HUGE RED FLAG.\n\nd.  Opportunities that offer you instant riches(example:  $100,000 dollars in one week):  These are often referred to as get rich schemes.  These are always scams, and you should stay away from them.  Business is a systematic process that requires time patience and consistency to get a sizable income.  Now, it is very possible in any industry to make several hund"

2,"If substances move from higher concentration to lower concentration, why do clouds even form?
The way I understand it, a cloud is a high concentration of vapor. I mean, it seems to me like the water vapor(or particles, whatever) would have to be spread throughout the sky evenly.  What keeps them in little areas to form clouds?  And for that matter, what are the minimum requirements for clouds to form?  Does it depend on humidity?  Temperature?  Why can it be 99% humidity and cloud-free?  Man, I really wonder about clouds.  This is a follow-up question from my last question, also about clouds.
The mechanism of Cloud formation is still not understood. Researchers are now applying Chaos Theory in the study and modelling of cloud behavior.\n\nWe ""see"" clouds only when the high moisture regions are sufficiently close to refract and reflect light. Actually they are highly dynamic systems."
1,"What makes a religion?
Okay, when I think of any sort of religion, it (loosly) follows the same format. 1) There is always a source of power/spirituality (God, inner self, earth, sun, ect.) 2) There are some rules/guidelines to how to practice said faith, and 3) There are followers, as well as people specially educated to teach it to those who wish to learn. Since some religions have no god, could we Americans potentially have to adhere to some forms of Martial Arts as a religion? (That is of course, if it's practitioners were to begin looking at it that way.)
Most martial arts do have a strong spiritual component.  But as to what makes a religion, I think you have done a pretty good job of summarizing.  However, I'm not sure I agree that ""some religions have no god.""  I think if they call it a religion, then the concept of God, in some form, is a part of that.  They may have a fairly abstract or intellectual version of it, but generally, there is such a concept.\n\nI may be wrong, though, about Buddhists, specifically.  Is the word ""God"" in some language used in Buddhism?  I know Gautama (sorry if it's not spelled right) is not considered a god, exactly, but in some sense divine.  Is Nirvana actually a oneness with God?"
3,"I have gained approx. 80 lbs in a year what can iI do?
I  had my son 2 yrs ago and i lost all the wieght. I was down to 195. I've always been heavy. My husband starting messing around when our son was 4 weeks old and left when he was 3 months. During the next year we went round and round about whether or not he was comming back. (he has developed a serious drug problem so he wont be comming back) during thay time I gained all this weight. I am now doing well on my own but have so much weight to lose. As of today I am 274lbs. and nothing fits and im disgusted. I cant seem to get out of the rut. Any suggestions?
Ask yourself what your issue is - do you eat too much? eat when  your sad, angry, depressed, or bored? Or do you not exercise enough, or maybe both? And then decide what you're going to do about it, a step at a time....like this week, try to eat more vegetables, less carbohydrates, and try to take some 15-20 minutes walks. Most Americans have a problem with sugar, not fat, so try to eat less sugary things. Next week, increase the walking time, and try to eat healthier. I use a great website to keep track of what I eat - and am sometimes surprised at how it adds up - it's called www.fitday.com, adn it's free. I'm trying to lose weight too, and so I wish you luck. If you don't think you're eating too much, you may want to go to the doctor to be checked for diabetes or thyroid problems."
1,"Innuendo,are you getting tired of it yet?
Do feel that it has taken over conversation way too much,it seems that you can`t say anything in company without sexual innuendo stealing in, whats your view?
This is very true. A person really has to watch what they say so that it is not taken the wrong way. I think this has come out of the fact that our media has this content so ingrained in it. Look at children's movies! They often have sexual jokes hidden in them that adults will be able to get and children will not. I think this is pervading our conversations and infiltrating all aspects of life."
2,"Energy metabolism?
you are used to running three miles a day at a slow pace. One day you run a mile as fast as you can. You then feel winded and you have severe pain in your leg. Why does the experience change so?
there are 2 types of muscle FIBERS. The FAST TWITCH and SLOW twitch. Fast twitch contract more vigorously but has a limited supply of oxygen. Slow twitch contract less vigorous but contain a lot of oxgen which can withstand longterm contractions. Running 3 miles a day at a slow pace is endurance training. It gives more room for the development of more slow twitch muscle fibers. But if you are not conditioned to run at faster speeds it would cause your muscles who have slow twitch fibers to overwork and it cannot adapt to the new oxygen requirements and conditions. Oxygen is consumed in an ineffective manner and lactic acid builds up in the muscle this causes the pain you experience in the leg. Likewise in the case for a sprinter who is well conditioned for the task, fasttwitch fibers use oxygen in a faster rate more effectively but if the activity is prolonged they can no longer support it because they are likewise not adapted to prolonged activities"

I just want to know what other peoples experiences were if you have worked in a place like this. Its a 24/hr care home for teen girls who are on probation and have mental disorders. I am going to be a caregiver and am really excited about this job. Anyone have any advice or info?
Yes. In the U.S. I'm not sure where you will be working, but it is a noble cause, and a lot of work. The girls will look up to you if you are firm, yet loving and playful. I worked in a treatment facility for girls aged 9-17. We had 11 girls on the unit, with a partner and I. The program encouraged us to act as role models --or as Mom and Dad. We had a special group at the end of the day to process how the day went, what worked, what didn't, and who was responsible for what...the girls, most of the time, responded well to this model. These children come from the most unfortunate of situations--most of them taken away from parents who did atrocious acts on them. Therefore, these girls' mental health was affected greatly. A word of wisdom: sometimes you may remind a girl or two of somebody who caused them great suffering, and they might treat you poorly as a result. Don't take this ""projection"" personally. Be patient, and use kind words. Use it as a key to get into a little girl's disturbed heart. It might make a difference in her life. Good luck--where I worked, the turn-over rate was nine months (I worked there for 3 years.)"

Please help!!!!!!!!!!!
Gargle with warm salt water, drink plenty of warm fluids, and suck on throat lozenges.  If your sore throat is due to a virus, there's not much you can do about it, your body has to fight it on its own.  If it's bacterial, (such as strep throat) then you may need an antibiotic.  So if you have this sore throat for more than 3 days without any improvement (ie. the pain is worse or the intensity of the pain has not changed), then you should see your doctor."

1,"Is there a leopard with so many spots that not even God knows how many?

Well in theory, if a large cat were to have uniform spacing of dark and light spots on it, then the number of spots would be about 1/7 of the number of hairs on it's body.  There are appx. 100,000 hairs on the human head, so I might imagine that there are as many as 1 million on the body of a leoard.  That would be about 150,000 spots, except at that ratio it would only appear as a shade of color, so it would have to be significantly less than that when the human eye could see individual spots, I'd guess at least 3 hairs between each spot.\n\nSo based on my assumption of 1 million total and about 3 hairs in 6 directions (commonly accepted spread in geometric world, look at a Chinese Checkers Board).  But the spot itself would probably have to have a minimum of 3 hairs in it to be seen.  So 3/21 or 1/7 like I sid rearlier so 150,000(142,000) number was about right.\n\nI don't know the exact numbers, but I'm sure 150,000 spots would be well within the knowledge of God if a person has 100,000 hairs and he knows them all.\n\nMatthew 10\n29Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. 30And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.\n\nAlso recorded in Luke 12"
1,"Do you think that people can stop being gay?
and go to church and get married, and live a normal straight life. \n(hmmm. interesting question.)
No, I don't think they can.  You are entitled to believe whatever you want to believe. Belief rarely makes things real however. \nHomosexuality is no more a choice than heterosexuality. People can tell you it is, you can believe them -- this is America, there is NO requirement that you not believe whatever you want. That won't change the belief from being false however.\n\nThe people with choice are the bisexuals. They can select either. My lover of nearly 15 years is bisexual. He selected to be with me. I understand this. The choice for gays however is to believe in themselves and live good, full lives -- or hide, be miserable and be someone/something other than what they are.\n\nHow do we know this? Well, let's start with animal studies. For hundreds of years it was commonly presumed that there were no exclusively homosexual animals -- I still hear that argument quoted occasionally. Yet, we know it is false. Not only do we know anectodally (I for example grew up on a farm. At one point we had a gay bull -- absolutely no response to the pheremones of females in heat at all -- much more interested in other bulls), but we also know scientifically. Hundreds of species have been studied, those species that had pair bonding also had homosexual pair bonding. The seminal study on this subject is Dr. Bruce Bagemihl -- ""Biological Exuberance"" from St. Martin's Press. You can probably get a used copy inexpensively from Amazon if you are interested, or from Barnes and Noble online.\n\nSo, what was classically the most powerful argument against the natural origins of homosexuality -- emasculated. And you can tell that many anti-gay leaders know it, because the argument is now much deemphasized compared to its usage 25 years ago.\n\nOnce you go beyond the natural law argument therefore -- you face the discussion of humanity itself.\n\nIs homosexuality a choice? Well, is heterosexuality? For bisexuals who elect to be straight or gay -- it is a choice, clearly; but the average straight boi never has the ability to choose to be gay -- and those who are honest would tell you the same. Likewise, the average homosexual simply doesn't have a choice to be straight.\n\nAgain, anecdotally, its easy enough. I am gay, I knew that I felt very special about boys and that they excited me somehow, gave me butterflies in my stomach when I liked them a lot -- when I was 8. I also knew I didn't feel the same way about girls. By 11 I realized it was sexual (the reasons I realized that should be evident without my spelling them out). I never, ever had even a single erotic or sexual thought about a girl -- nor did I have any romantic feelings toward them. I always had some friends of each gender, as most young country people do -- but I never had any butterflies for the girls -- so when did I choose? At 7? Without knowing it? Do you really, really believe that? I don't think you do. You can assert that I'm lying to you, that all the millions of gays who say they never remember being anything but gay are lying -- but again, it doesn't pass the smell test -- do you really believe it? I doubt it very much. You are too honest for that, aren't you? So that leaves you with -- we have all deceived ourselves. I doubt that you believe that either, not deep inside.\n\nBeyond that, study after study, piling up on one another. The eyeblink study strongly indicates a genetic origin. The pheremonal studies (there are multiple ones), even a logitudnal study that looked at prebirth reactions. And, most compelling, the fruitfly study. A colleague's husband, who is a medical researcher at Albany Med, sent me word the day after that came out -- saying simply ""you've won, the troops in the trenches on both sides may take a while to realize it, but you've won, its natural."" The counter attacks on the fruit fly study are, frankly, a joke -- and they depend on their readers not understanding the study to start w"
3,"what's leukaemia?
explain about that!!how to work?
Leukaemia\nWhat is leukaemia?\nIt is a cancer of the white blood cells that are made in the bone marrow. \n\nLeukaemia occurs when normal body cells get out of control, multiply and spread. \nWhen our bodies are working normally, the bone marrow makes all the different blood cells we need to keep healthy. It makes white cells to help us fight infections, red cells to carry oxygen around the body and platelets to help the blood to clot properly.\n\nIf you have leukaemia your bone marrow makes too many abnormal white blood cells. These can cause problems in a number of ways…\n\nthere may not be enough normal white cells left to fight infections - and this can make you very ill\n\n\nthe abnormal cells may take up too much space in the bone marrow, so that the body can't make enough red blood cells and platelets. If you have too few red cells you may become anaemic. If you have too few platelets you may get bleeding problems - from your nose or gums, for instance\n\n\nthe abnormal cells can get into the bloodstream and travel around the body. They may build up in one place, causing problems such as swelling and pain.\n\nhttp://www.cancernorth.nhs.uk/cancertypes/Leukaemia/Whatisleukaemia"

I love christianiny, now I love Judaism, Buddist, and all denominations of Catholics. I am trying to understand and appreciate the Islam religions, and all I get is  seggregation, bitterness, hatefulness, and denial from most christians and existentialists....Just remember that if compassion, love, and unity is not in your belief, than you are a bad person no matter what your belief is. But I won't judge U, it's not my job...I just ask that U don't give personal opinions to simple questions...please...(yes. It is your right I know)
""Just remember that if compassion, love, and unity is not in your belief, than you are a bad person no matter what your belief is."" <=== That right there says it all. Christians have lost touch with that because they are so wrapped up in their image...so anything out of place to them is automactically fought against and you can't be like that--rude, uncompassionate, and un-loving. God wouldn't want that so why should you treat others indifferently because of what they believe or what they want to try. \n\nI love you for bringing that up. I'm a christian and I'm not like that at all. So it gets annoying when others are."
1,"What's the difference between cute, pretty, beautiful and stunning when used to describe a woman?

The difference comes from within. \n\nYou are a mixture of what you feel and what you know. Most of the times what you feel overtakes what you know about yourself and about the others. If you feel stunning, then you are a stunning woman. But if you feel miserable, doesn't matter how you look to the others.\n\nHow do you feel about yourself?"

3,"How can I get the family  to accept that I'm an alcoholic?
What I mean is, I drank for a looong time and knew I had a big time problem.  Everyone knew that.  Now that I've gotton intensive treatment and regularly attend meetings for help, I think I'm doing great.  I have a new lease on life, enjoy new, sober friends and am back enjoying my family, and they enjoy me.  The only thing is, my mom keeps wondering, ""Do you still have to go to meetings?  Are you cured?"" It would break my heart to tell her I will never be 'cured'--it puts a negative spin on things.  But I don't want to be dishonest.  What should I say when she brings it up?  My dad won't really say too much, but he's glad. Seems worse of a stigma sometimes admitting it to them what I am then when I was falling down all the time embarassing them.  sorry so long.  Thanks!
This is hard.  First off, if you were an alcoholic then your parents probably already know.  The problem is that your mother just wants everything to be all better.  She doesn't understand the nature of the disease, so she's probably filled with the wrong ideas.  You have to educate her.  Working the steps will help you do that, and your mother will accept your treatment as long as she knows that without your meetings and your sober friends, you stand a good chance dying a drunk.  You can't hide it from them, it gives you a crutch if you ever relapse.  If you are done drinking find a sponser, work the steps and live honest.  My prayers."

well, considering i had sex while on my period on a number of occassions and no one has ever gotten it otherwise, i'd say it would depend on if the guy had an open sore or scab (friction can cause it to re-open). \n\n\nhcv infected blood + open wound= transmission is more likely to occur.\n\nplease ignore the posters who obviously do not know what they are talking about.

3,"How long does it take to lose 20 pounds?

10 to 20 weeks.  The recommendation is to lose 1 - 2 pounds per week to make sure that you lose fat and only fat.  You don't want to lose muscle because this will slow your metabolism.  So at  1 - 2 pounds per week, that's 10 to 20 weeks.  You'll be much more likely to keep the weight off for good if you lose slowly and sensibly."

it's an area of high magnetic activity that keeps heat convection from occuring. Basically the magnetic forces cools the spot, making it darker in comparison to the rest of the surface of the sun. Sun spots also occurs in cycles of around 30 years, but nobody knows what causes is this..."

2,"How is electricity generated from a battery cell and how does it get exhausted ?

The ""power"" in any electric current is 'voltage'.\n'Voltage' is the measure of the potential difference of electrons between two substances, and therefore the potential for electrons to be transferred between them.\nBatteries generate electricity through any one of several electrochemical reactions.  \nTwo different types of metals are placed in a catalyst (usually a liquid).  When a circuit is completed between the positive side and the negative side, electrolysis occurs - the above mentioned transferring of electrons through chemical reactions from one metal to the other.  The difference in potential felt between the  positive and negative charges (giving off an electron results in a positive charge, accepting it results in a negative charge) is again your volts.\nThe reaction continues until the battery reaches homeostasis (equilibrium, balance).\nIn some kinds of batteries applying an outside electric current properly can reverse the process - allowing you to recharge the battery.\nRechargeable batteries eventually become exhausted because of of oxidation of the polarizing metals or due to a 'memory' buildup.  'Memory' refers to a battery that is not completely discharged before it is recharged.  This is the major reason for the degradation of rechargeable battery life cycles."

Can anyone help with this. have suggestions any ohter meds or herbal stuff work
The question you should be asking is WHY DO YOU KEEP GETTING THIS?  Most likely you are acquiring this from a partner who has not been treated. Men are often carriers of bacteri and ASYMPOMATIC.  If you have not had intercourse since first treatment and it still comes back, then you may need to consider that you are immunocompromised. (Your defenses are weak) which means you need to be treated for more than just the BV.  Perhaps you should seek the opinion of another gynecologist?"

I believe indefinitely, for a woman.  I lived at the hospital with my husband for 3 months, 9 yrs. ago.  The thought of sex was not there.  He did die.

The most likely scenario is that oil will continue to become more and more expensive to extract and distribute which will make alternative energy sources more economically feasible by comparison.  Crude oil supply is expected to become constrained by lack of sources within the next few years - even as China and other developing nations increase their demand.\n\nCosts of alternative energy are decreasing and costs of oil and gas are increasing, at a certain point they will cross and people will begin using petroleum fuels only when they have no other alternative.  This will slow down oil consumption dramatically and lead to a more balanced energy supply, but the days of cheap energy are nearly over. - at least for a while."
2,"butterfly effect?
i have heard all these weird thing like if some butterfly flaps its wing some tornado will happen at the oter side of the world is that true like that will happen i see alot of butterfly flaping wings but nothing happen
This is just a name, a metaphor for an effect described in chaos theory.  The idea is that small effects *can* multiply on top of each other to create larger effects.  So a butterfly's wings *could* theoretically make tiny vortexes that affect the microclimate of a swamp, that through all the things that cause weather effects too complex to model, could produce a storm halfway around the world.  This is just purely theoretical, a metaphorical model.  But that's what it means."
2,"tell me more about "" uranium"" why  it is   big source of energy?

not regurgitating from wikipedia, which isn't always correct OR understandable OR contains little information on the topic, here I go.\n\nUranium, as it's been said is a big atom which contains a whole lot of little pieces. There is something called ""binding energy"" that keeps all these little pices together. When a big atom undergoes all of this radioactive decay it goes from a smaller mass to a large mass. THe numbers are really small, but using Einstien's E=mc^2 any change of mass no matter how small will produce some meaningful amount of energy. Now, for 238 grams of Uranium, there are 6.023*10^23 atoms. So, you multiply the little miniscule energy emission by a very large number and you get a pretty big amount of energy.\n\nSo, short answer, becuase it is a big atom, it contains a lot of binding energy that is released when the atom splits."

The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero.

3,"Why is yawning contagious?

its so funny i read your question and it made me yawn and made me wonder so i looked it up for ya\n\n\n\nThe yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to ""sympathetically"" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth. This phenomenon has been observed among various primates. The threat gesture is a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. The contagion of yawning is interspecific, for example a human yawning in front of a pet dog can incite the dog to yawn as well. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word yawn."
3,"Has anyone had any really bad experiences on Atenolol (a beta-blocker)?
I just got on Atenolol four days ago and it's really wearing me out. About 30 mins after I take it I feel very fainty and if I sit/lay down then I fall in to a deep sleep. My body has felt weird, like tingly (for lack of a better word). And my chest feels tighter, or heavier. Like if my boyfriend lays his head on my chest while we're laying down then I feel like I can't breath? Is all this normal? Is my body just getting use to the medicine or is this how it's going to be?
PLEASE talk to your doctor ASAP or contact the hospital, for advice, while it maybe normal to feel a little weird when starting a new medication, it is not normal to feel faint, tingly, heavy chested and wanting to  or falling into a deep sleep.\n\n\nAtenolol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\ndizziness\nlightheadedness\ntiredness\ndrowsiness\ndepression\nupset stomach\ndiarrhea\n\nSome side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n\nshortness of breath\nswelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\nunusual weight gain\nfainting\n\n\nI don't wish to alarm you but I has a similar experience with another  drug, and at the time I had no idea that I had a major allergic reaction, all similar to the symptoms you have described. I eventually passed out, (no one could wake me, and I was barely breathing) in the middle of my 40th birthday party (not one drop of alcohol, passed my lips). But I seriously did not think it was all that serious until, I spoke to my doctor the next day. \n\nSo do speak to some one sooner rather than later."
7,"i need help so does anyone know any reasons gambling affects our economic stability?

Our entire capitalist system is based upon gambling. The basis of a market economy, is people putting up risk capital on the assumption the people they invest in can grow that business into a larger asset.\n\nAs for casino gambling, or other forms of chance, they are dependant upon excess capital in the marketplace. The growth of the gaming business is resultant from individuals spending their entertainment dollars on a product that could yield a substantive result. \n\nObviously, most people don't win, but their entertainment investment results in employment for those in the gaming sector, a return to investors (who own the gaming companys) and the lions share goes to host governments. the government funds are usually put into general revenues and go to pay for roads, hospitals, etc.\n\nThe down-side is problem gaming. Some folks spend more than they can afford to lose, and it negatively affects themselves and those around them. Most studies suggest a problem gaming rate of about 3-7% in North America. While funds are taken out of gaming revenues to deal with addiction issues, the problem will always exist in some form.\n\nThe net benefits of the gaming/entertainment industry are substantially positive. It provides for hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of government revenue and billions returned to the capital markets. If the economy were to tank, casinos would be hit hard as they are primarily a luxury business as opossed to a necessity.\n\nGambling reflects our economic stability, it doesn't affect it."
2,"how dose a satellite work?
how a satellite is controlling ?
Most modern satellites have similar basic parts and most have extra parts for their special needs. They have generally three basic parts. They are a radar system which is used to measure the height from the earths surface, receivers and transmitters to receive and send out signals, usually radio or micro waves, they also have small altitude control nozzles that squirt out puffs of gas to tilt the satellite to change it’s altitude or direction. These are also known as thrusters or sometimes ‘puffers'. Most satellites have special equipment for their special needs. For example Research satellites may have telescopes and antennae that they point into space to receive rays from deep in space, Survsat (survey satellites) have telescopes, cameras and other sensors to view the earth’s surface and Comsat (communications satellites) have various antennae and thousands of transponders (automatic devices used to receive and send radio signals) each one dealing with a radio or telephone signal, or dealing with part of a Television channel. All of the equipment is built by electronics experts and aerospace engineers who give satellite makers a range that they can choose from. Some satellite makers sell their satellites commercially and their satellites can cost you in excess of US$15million and can take up to two years to build. Custom satellites can also be made for individual needs but these can take double the time and can cost up to five times as much. It can be seen that the satellite business is a very costly one.\n\nSatellites electronics have to be powered and are usually sone so with the help of the sun. Satellites have large panels, which fold out and contain many solar cells. Although this is the case for half of the satellites orbit it is in total darkness and therefore it needs to have a battery to power it, which most satellites do. These batteries as recharged by the solar panels and then continue to power the satellite during the time of darkness."
2,"What is the difference between an atrial septal defect and a patent foramen ovale?

a patent foreman ovale is one form of an atrial septal defect.  the foramen ovale is a hole between the two atria that is open while the fetus is in the womb.  this allows all the blood to be sent straight from the right side of the heart to the left skipping the lungs (which is pointless in the womb as they're not the ones oxygenating the blood).  \n\nwhen the baby is born, blood preasure in the left atrium raises which pushes the foramen ovale closed.  the definition of a patent foramen ovale is when it doesn't close.  it's usually a surgical treatment.  \n\nthere are other kinds of atrial septal defects that involve other parts of the septum, but are not about the foramen ovale closing.  they are also surgical treatments, but are caused by other developmental defects."

3,"What is Cancer?
Development of cancer, Types of treatment, effects of cancer
Cancer is a disease of cells. It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). \n\nCancer is also called malignancy. A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor. A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign. Benign tumors are not cancer. \n\nCancer is not one disease. It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer is NOT contagious.\n\nCancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area. Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start. If a cancer spreads (metastasizes), the new tumor bears the same name as the original(primary) tumor. \n\nThe frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender. While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women, the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women, breast cancer. \n\nCancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality. Skin cancers are often curable. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.\n\nCancer is the Latin word for crab. The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy, doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades. Cancer may also be called malignancy, a malignant tumor, or a neoplasm (literally, a new growth).\n\nTreatment\n\nDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades. Traditionally, cancer has been treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list. New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed, such as antiangiogenic agents (e.g., angiostatin and endostatin), genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies, retinoid agents, and vaccine agents (stimulating the immune system)."

Absolutely, just like there is increased risk for older mothers in having children at older ages (Down's Syndrome risk in children increases dramatically with mother's age for example), the same thing holds true for fathers.  \n\nRemember that germ cells are created during our DEVELOPMENT, and remain in tact in our bodies until there are no more left (in females this is menopause)."

If y ou're under 18 eat more vegetables and fruit. Walk at least 1 mile a day. If you're 20-30 pray you can look at food and get fat. The metabolism slows down for women especially at the age of 22. I'm 30 years old I started fasting 3 days out of the week W-F and during the week I drink a large glass of water b4 I eat so I will not over do it. I only eat sweets during my cycle which is once a month. By then I deserve them but at the same time they're low calorie snacks and ice cream.

2,"Can you help my daughter with a question about photosynthesis and respiration?
I don't want to give her the answer, but I need information in order to lead her there.  Experiment: plants grown in dark, light/dark, and 24 hour light stations.  What is going on in terms of photosynthesis and respiration at each station?
I'm always happy to help out a Van Halen fan! Anyway, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy and fuel to grow, and also to manufacture proteins, the most important of which is chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color. They also convert this light into sugars anfd starches, which they need to grow. (The storing of these sugars, in fact, along with the slowing down of the photsynth, is what gives those autumn leaves their great colors.)  During the dark hours the plants are basically dormant, and thus no photosynth taking place, but they are still respirating, i.e. taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They do this in light too, of couse, but at a faster rate. But just like we need our sleep, the plants need the dark also to rest and store their food, otherwise they would expend it all and thus dry out, which is why they get yellow (depleted chlorophyl) with too much sun."

3,"hi,I want to loose some wheight whats the best way??

First of all, (very important) don't eat ANY type of meat for a week (and if you like the way you feel after a week , go without it for two weeks to feel even better). This includes any soups that have a beef/chicken stock as the base. So buy vegetarian vegetable soup...not just vegetable soup, and eat it for supper(Campbell's (don't buy generic brand..its bland). This also includes milk. No cow milk. Buy some Soy milk. I promise it is delicious..I use 8th continent original soymilk. And this is 100% healthier than cow milk. This will help you alot. \n(no butter for a week!!, no ranch dressing, no sour cream...nothing of the sort...and try to lay off of the cheese unless it is soy cheese) \n\nSecond of all, no candy bars, chocolates, donuts with frosting center, cakes, ice cream....just go 1 week without sweets  \nI usually eat oatmeal for breakfast, and I either cut up fresh peaches, strawberries or even canned peaches and I don't need any sugar. \nFor a good snack in between I drink a mug of hot lemon water with honey added to sweeten. \n(*when feeling hungry, drinking a mug/cup of anything warm will ease your hungry tummy*) \nFor snacks when craving sweets: eat almonds, peanuts, soynuts, raisins, ovaltine mixed with soymilk is ok on this detox diet, drink a big cup of orange juice, eat fresh fruit, apples, oranges, strawberries, etc. \nEat vegetables and rice. Can buy frozen packages of broccolli, cauliflower, carrots, and raw type as well for snacks. \nGot a blender? Make smoothies with your new fruit selections, a natural, detoxing milkshake. Just don't use yogurt(which is cow milk based), >>>but add some soymilk, orange juice, bananas and strawberries for a shake that is out of this world!!!! \nI have always used this as my way to start exercising again. \n\n(tip: Slim Fast products have always helped me too(even though the shakes are cow-milk based). They have a meal bar called ""fruit & nut bar"" that is great. If i wake up and want to go for a jog or exercise, I take about 2-3 bites (don't eat whole bar before exercising) and it helps me feel not-sluggish during my workout.) \n\nMajor tip: anyone over the age of 20 should be taking a daily vitamin. I HIGHLY suggest buying some multivitamins (i use a woman's weight smart MV), Super B-Complex, and Vitamin C. These 3 are a must-take-each-day and you'll see an even better change in a couple of weeks. If I am feeling bloated, I buy diurex water pills and take for 5-7 days as well.\n\nFollow this strictly and you WILL see a change & feel better, that is a promise!\n\n(warning: if you have any cardiovascular problems at all do Not use water pills unless it is ok'd by your doctor, as it will interfere with your High BP medicine; and as always, if you are on any medications discuss any dramatic new diet choices with your doctor as it could affect the purpose of your medicine.)"

1,"what a good sentence for righteous?

well, ""righteous"" means marked by moral justification, or correct and without guilt or sin, so it means something postitive.  on the other hand, ""self-righteous"" has a sort of negative connotation, meaning the speaker is someone who is perhaps hypocritically so, see also ""holier-than-thou"" or ""sanctimonious"".\n\nso, if you are looking for examples of sentences that USE these words, righteous might be used in ""Bob stood on the steps of the church and issued a righteous condemnation of abortion.""  \n\nself-righteous, on the other hand, might be used like ""Bob's speech against abortion seemed particularly self-righteous in the light of his support for the death penalty.""\n\nif you're looking for examples of sentences that *are* righteous, then.. well, since today is a special day, i will point you to martin luther king jr.'s ""I have a dream"" speech, which is full of righteous language and ideas:\nhttp://www.mecca.org/~crights/dream.html\n\non the other hand, if you're looking for self-righteousness, this guy is a great example:\nhttp://www.rushlimbaughonline.com/refutingrush/2003dec22.htm"

Ok well I got to see first hand why Texas is such an amazing place! I was raised there most of my life and you take for granted all the wonderful warming people that are there! My parents moved us to Virginia where I am still located and it was a complete wake up call for me! The people are not nearly as sweet and generous and it doesn't have that good old home feel. See, when your in Texas, its like your neighbors and your friends are all family to you and not so distant as they are here. Also the food in Texas is absolutely amazing . .  all you eastern folks who claim they have had great Mexican, are completely wrong unless you have tried true authentic Tex Mex! Nothing gets better than that! Since Texas is sooo big, you don't even have to leave the state because there is somewhere for everyone to like! You have the big city life for the ones that like high end stuff and fashion, all the way to the southern country ranches with good old cowboys! You always here all those songs like God Bless Texas and Come Back to Texas because everyone takes pride in this wonderful state.  We all are family here and we cherish it so much! It may not be the most beautiful place but once you meet someone from Texas you just feel like you have known them so long because there so friendly and thats how they were grown up to be!

2,"what is clairvoyant and how do you get it/?

Clairvoyant is a person having clairvoyance which literally means ""clear vision."" Although there are several studies that have been or still being conducted about this paranormal ability, most researchers are still skeptical about the idea.\n\nClairvoyants claim to have one or more of the following abilities:\n1. The ability to see the other realms (spirit realm, ghosts, demons, nature beings, divine beings such as angels, etc.)\n2. The ability to know in detail, events that happened in the past (Russian research focuses on this for criminal investigative purposes).\n3. The ability to foretell future events.\n4. The ability to see beyond opaque matter, some kind of x-ray vision if you will.\n\nClairvoyance may not always profess itself as enhanced visions. ""Clear"" hearing and smell can also be classified as clairvoyance.\n\nExperts say that these abilities are said to innate and that all persons possess them. However, the level or degree of these abilities vary one person to another. There are several sites that talks of training oneself to activate clairvoyance. Or you can visit your local bookstore or library for books about opening your clairvoyance."
1,"Can you believe in the paranormal realm and be a Christian?
I was raised by my mother who is a Christian (baptist), and by my grandmother who was a psychic medium. I was taught about the bible AND taken to psychic fairs as a kid. I'm 33 and still having problems integrating my 2 belief systems. What do you think about this?
I can well understand your confusion. Maybe this will help ... #1: No one but YOU can judge whether or not you're a Christian. If you say you're one then you are one. OK, that part of your question is settled. #2: To whom do you give the authority to decide what else you believe? Who has authority over you and can tell you what you must believe as a Christian? Isn't that a little like whether or not you're a Christian? Isn't that YOUR call? Isn't that between you and your concept of God ... And NO ONE else? #3: The paranormal, aka psychic phenomena. Can you integrate that into your Christian belief system? Well, maybe. Maybe its not nearly so foreign to that belief system as you've been lead to believe. Maybe you've just been misinformed by people who in turn were misinformed or who in their studies misunderstood the thing. Maybe ... Think about these things ... Psychics have visions of the future, channelers talk to angels and others, readers of various types make predictions, and astrologers look at the stars and find wonders there. Any biblical co-relations here? John had visions of the future. Lot talked with angels. Prophets have made many predictions. And the Wise Men from the East? They were Persian Magi, well versed in astrology. They followed a star, and found a Great Wonder. Maybe, just maybe, the Bible and REAL Christianity is wrapped all around the paranormal. Maybe its just that certain things go by different names in different schools of thought and that confuses an issue that otherwise wouldn't be confused at all. Maybe to be a Christian you have no choice but to believe in the paranormal. Maybe other Christians just use different words to describe the same things and the only real problem of integrating these ""seemingly different"" belief systems rests there and no where else. Maybe. ~ Peace & Blessings ~"

Don't look at the scales! Honestly there's no point in judging your weight loss by looking at your scales. Instead put on clothes that you were wearing 3 months ago and see how they feel on you. If the clothes are looser then what does it matter what you weigh in pounds/kilos/stones?\n10 years ago I used to be 8 stones and a size 12, now I'm 9 and a half stone and size 10.

2,"whats a glacier?

A glacier is a large, long-lasting river of ice that is formed on land and moves in response to gravity. A glacier is formed by multi-year ice accretion in sloping terrain. Glacier ice is the largest reservoir of fresh water on Earth, and second only to oceans as the largest reservoir of total water. Glaciers can be found on every continent, including on the greater Australian continent. Glaciers are more or less permanent bodies of ice and compacted snow that have become deep enough and heavy enough to flow under their own weight.\n\nGeologic features associated with glaciers include end, lateral, ground and medial moraines that form from glacially transported rocks and debris; U-shaped valleys and corries (cirques) at their heads, and the glacier fringe, which is the area where the glacier has recently melted into water."

2,"Does light generae heat or heat generate light?

Both are true, this is because heat IS light.\n\nHeat is actually the common word for 'Infra Red Radiation'... but of couse heat is shorter and easier to say. IR radiation is a form of 'light' that is just beyond our visible spectrum.\n\nWhen any type of light hits matter it causes the molecules to vibrate, this can cause IR radiation to be released, thus being felt by us as 'heat'.\n\nLikewise, when molecules are heated up, such as in a fire, they vibrate and can often release light that we can see.\n\nA fire, for example, releases a large amount of light in the red area of the spectrum thus appearing red and yellow... this happens to be near the infra red part of the spectrum, so it is hot too.\n\nCOMPLEX VERSION:\nIn an atom there are electrons, when light hits an electron it gains energy. The electron then slowly looses energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.\nElectromagnetic radiation that is releasesd is dependant on the element, bonding involved, and the electron orbital. thus a wide variety of light can be given off.\nLight can include both visible light and infrared light... infra-red light being that which causes us to feel heat (due to its ability to vibrate the molecules of our bodies)."
2,"how does a compressor work on a drill rig?
smith capital hot line 310
A screw compressor is connected to a motor to be driven by the motor even during periods of low compressed air consumption. During such periods, the screw compressor is at least partially unloaded to make it easier and less costly to drive the compressor. The unloading is performed by removing air from the compressor. Preferably, that is done by communicating the air inlet of a small capacity vacuum device with the air outlet of the screw compressor. Suction from the vacuum device is transmitted to the air outlet of the screw compressor to suck air out of the screw compressor to reduce the engine horsepower needed to rotate the screw compressor. The vacuum device can also be used to boost the air volume and/or the air pressure. The system can be used in a drilling rig which drills holes in the ground. The screw compressor can be unloaded during start up of the motor by briefly driving the vacuum device by pressurized liquid from a pre-pressurized hydraulic accumulator."

Can you believe she had the nerve to ask for more money.  I ended up calling the Canada police, they gave me a numver to a dept. called phone busters so I could give a report.

i don't understand why some people still don't want to accept evolution. haven't they've been shown proof enough? if you want some evidence, all one needs to do is look at yourselves. look at all the different types of people. don't the christians believe that all humans have common ancestors in adam and eve? doesn't that show that humans have adapted to different areas, climates, and cultural preferences around the world? adaptation is a basic pillar of evolution. another example is the dog. through, not only selective breeding (a form of natural selection being that we are nature and we selected who would pass on certain traits), but the fact that wolves and dogs are technically the same species because they can mate and will have fertile offspring. the differences between dogs and wolves are many. for instance, wolves have lager heads and larger brain capicties than dogs, but their dna is differs only as much as black guy and white guy which is very little. what do you think?
don't even get me started! already the religious folk are posting, don't rock their faith or they'll burn your house down for pointing out the obvious.  Evolution is just a theory, one of the best so far, the theory itself will evolve (proof in the pudding?) until the answer becomes clear.  At least scientists attempt to provide answers, make us think and progress as a species, no religion has ever done anything but stagnate a population, we are still too young as a species, too many of us are bought up in house of racist, superioristic (a word?) and thoroughly backward teachings, it's like a virus handed down from generation to generation.  Pity, we could be so much more, and we will be, but it takes millenia to evolve."
3,"why say ''head over heels'' ? the head already is over the heels?

This means Excited, and/or turning cartwheels to demonstrate one's excitement..\nMany people would recognise that meaning. What most wouldn't do is take time to consider that it makes no literal sense - after all head over heels is the normal posture. A version of the phrase originated in the 14th century as 'heels over head', which is really what we mean when we use it. The phrase evolved into head over heels much later as it was used in everyday speech without a great deal of thought."
2,"what are areas bounded by 1,2,and 3 standard deviation--in statistics abd how do you do the calculations?
This is conerning the normal curve, properties and how you dertermine the shape
The areas bounded by any s.d. can be looked up ona table, but be aware that the tables can be set to give out the answer in several different ways. One such table is on the link below. To answer your question you would have to multiply each number by 2, eg, for 3 s.d. the table gives out 0.4987 (the area between 0 and 3 s.d.) so what you are looking for is 0.9974. You don´t do ""calculations"" to find these numbers. That would require solving an integral that so far no one has been able to do so analitically. What you do is work a numeric solution like simpsons integration or a polinomial approximation like Abramowitz´s"

They are demanding rights in a country that is not theres. It would be difference if they where legal immigrants. But what rights do illegal aliens have, this is going to be a start of a new racism from all Americans, except from Mexican Americans.
If there are illegals at the rallies they should be arrested. I do not think illegals should have any rights other than humane treatment while they are under arrest."

2,"what is the synthesis of amine from carboxylic acid by one step?

You can synthesize an 'amide' (has a carbonyl-nitrogen linkage) from a carboxylic acid in one step by reacting it with an amine.  In order to convert a carboxylic acid into an amine you would first have to convert the acid into another derivative (i.e. aan alcohol, etc.) before converting to the amine.  Regardless of how you do it, you will most likely have to employ multiple steps.\n\nIf anyone knows of a way to do this in one step, I would really like to know as well."

Chamomile tea is a natural sedative, and the basic herbal answer for insomnia.

1,"if muslims are so bad then why is that 70% reverts to islam are WOMEN, what made them come to islam?

Even though many aspects of Islaam are misunderstood by non-Muslims, the ignorance, misinformation and incorrect assumptions that are made in regards to Islaam's treatment of women are probably the most severe. \n\nNumerous verses of the Qur.aan make it clear that men and women are equal in the sight of God. According to the teachings of Islaam, the only thing that distinguishes people in the sight of God is their level of God-consciousness. Due to this, many people are surprised to find out that Islaamic Law guaranteed rights to women over 1400 years ago and that women in Europe and America only obtained their rights recently. For example, Islaam clearly teaches that a woman is a full-person under the law, and is the spiritual equal of a male. Also, according to Islaamic Law, women have the right to own property, operate a business and receive equal pay for equal work. Women are allowed total control of their wealth, they cannot be married against their will and they are allowed to keep their own name when married. \n\nAdditionally, they have the right to inherit property and to have their marriage dissolved in the case of neglect or mistreatment. Also, Islaam does not consider a woman an ""evil temptress"", and thus does not blame women for the ""original sin"". Women in Islaam participate in all forms of worship that men participate in. Actually, the rights that Islaam gave to women over 1400 years ago were almost unheard of in the West until the 1900's. \n\nLess than fifty years ago in England and America, a woman could not buy a house or car without the co-signature of her father or husband! Additionally, Islaam gives great respect to women and their role in society; it gives them the right to own property, marry who they want and many other rights. Also, it should be mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad's mission stopped many of the horrible practices in regards to women that were present in the society of his time. For example, the Qur.aan put an end to the pagan Arab practice of killing their baby daughters when they were born. \n\nAdditionally, Islaam put restrictions on the unrestricted polygamy of the Arabs of the time, and put many laws in place to protect the well-being of women. Today, most of the so-called reforms in the status of women came about after the West abandoned religion for secularism. Even those in the West who claim to follow the so-called ""Judaeo-Christian tradition"" really follow the values of Western liberalism, but just to a lesser degree than their more liberal countrymen. \n\nIf women in the Muslim World today don't have their rights, it is not because Islaam did not give them to them. The problem is that in many places alien traditions have come to overshadow the teachings of Islaam, either through ignorance or the impact of Colonialisation."
2,"Why is carbon dioxide classified as a greenhous gas?

Because it traps the heat from the sun and earth from escaping back into space, thereby making the planet warmer.  It's called the greenhouse affect.  That also causes more clouds and rain and blocking the suns heat making it cooler.....\n\nThere is still much debate as to how much is really caused by us, and how much is natural no matter what.  Our Earth has been everything from a molten planet to a glacier planet in it's 5 billion years, and we have only been recording temperature for about 150 years.  \n\nNobody can say anything for sure, too many variables, all we do know is it has been getting a little warmer the last few decades.  Anyone who says they know for sure why is not being honest with you or themselves.  It's a political issue now, and you know what that means, lies, lies lies."
2,"Frozen lake- how deep does the ice needs to get so that you can drive a car over it?
is there a way to know that it is safe all the way from one side to the other?
'Each year, as the ice begins to skim Minnesota’s lakes and ponds, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources receives hundreds of phone calls from anxious anglers who all have the same basic question: ""Is the ice safe yet?"" That’s when I whip out my trusty stock answer: ""No, ice is NEVER safe.""\n\n[...]\n\nHere are a few general guidelines for use by winter recreation enthusiasts to lessen their chances for an icy dip or worse. It’s impossible to judge the strength of ice by its appearance, thickness, daily temperature, or snow cover alone. Ice strength is actually dependent on all four factors, plus water depth under the ice, the size of the water and water chemistry, currents, and distribution of the load on the ice.\n\n[...]\n\n* Snowmobiles and ATV’s need at least 5 inches, and cars and light trucks need at least 8-12 inches of good clear ice.\n\n* Wear a life jacket. Life vests or float coats provide excellent flotation and protection from hypothermia (loss of body temperature). Never wear a life jacket if you are traveling in an enclosed vehicle, however. It could hamper escape in case of a breakthrough.\n\n* Carry a pair of homemade ice picks or even a pair of screwdrivers tied together with a few yards of strong cord that can be used to pull yourself up and onto the ice if you do fall in. Be sure they have wooden handles so if you drop them in the struggle to get out of the water, they won’t go straight to the bottom!\n\n* Avoid driving on the ice whenever possible. Traveling in a vehicle, especially early or late in the season is simply ""an accident waiting to happen."" In the 117 ice fatalities occurring in Minnesota since 1976, 68 percent involved a vehicle.\n\n* Be prepared to bail out in a hurry if you find it necessary to use a car, unbuckle your seatbelt and have a plan of action if you do breakthrough. Some safety experts recommend driving with the window rolled down and the doors ajar for an easy escape. Move your car frequently. Parking in one place for a long period weakens ice. Don’t park near cracks, and watch out for pressure ridges or ice heaves.\n\n* Don’t drive across ice at night or when it is snowing. Reduced visibility increases your chances for driving into an open or weak ice area.\n\n* Check at the access if there are signs that indicate an aeration system is in operation on the lake. Aerators keep areas of water open to provide oxygen for fish. The ice can be weakened many yards beyond where the ice is actually open. Stay well outside the fenced areas indicated by diamond shaped thin ice signs.'\n\n---\n\n'How can you tell if a lake is frozen solid enough to drive on? The surest way to know is to wait until several other cars and trucks have safely driven across the ice. Even then, you should always be extra careful when driving across a frozen lake.\n\nIt's possible that one section of the lake has currents that prevent the lake from freezing solid. Or there might be a river or stream that brings slightly warmer water into one part of the lake. So even though most of the lake was frozen solid, one section of the lake could have thin ice.'\n\n---\n\n'If you're driving your car (didn't we just say we don't recommend that) safety experts recommend that you drive with the windows down and your seatbelt off. Don't take this an excuse to drive without a seatbelt full time just in case you drive into a lake. Out on the ice you are driving on a lake and if the ice gives way from under you it is critical to get out of your vehicle before it is submerged.  A car crashing into water can sink in a matter of seconds.'\n\n---\n\n'Take a hard look at the ice before you leap. Clear blue ice is the strongest, and it still takes three inches to safely hold a single person, and five to six inches to safely hold a group of people or a snowmobile. You supposedly can venture out onto thinner ice if you distribute your weig"
2,"Should doctors increase or decrease the period of antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections?
Antibiotics should not be used for viral infections, as they are ineffective.  Much publicity has been given to the fact that the use of antibiotics may contribute to antibiotic resistant hospital strains of bacteria.  Therefore, dosages that used to be give for 30 days or 14 days have been reduced to 10 days or 7 days.  If the purpose of reducing antibiotic use is to reduce hospital strains, then wouldn't reducing the period of treatment actually increase the amount of surviving and mutating bacteria, thus frustrating the purported purpose of antibiotic restriction?\n\n(Make sure to cite your sources in a manner that they can be looked up and verified. You may include links. Answers without citation will not be considered for best answer.)
it is ridiculous and rather anal retentive for you to ask for references when you are asking for a person's opinion.\n\ncan't educated people give their insight without looking up the insight of other educated people?  where do you think they got theirs?  eventually it goes back to common sense and personal observations.  if your point is to bring YA! out of the dumps of misspellings and ""i don't know, but thanks for the points!"" answers, i respect that, but it won't happen overnight and it won't happen on questions like this just because you stick your signature addendum to the end.\n\nif you absolutely must have sources, you shouldn't put so much faith in internet links.  anyone can put anything on the internet and pass it off as fact.  do you believe them because their site design is superb, or because they pretend to be a physician?  if you want online sources, find them at google scholar or pub med.  even wikipedia is riddled with errors.  if you want better sources, try your doctor's office for medical journals, or your local library, or ask specific questions to an expert.\n\n\nas for answering your question....\n\nfirst, antibiotics are not the cure for a bacterial infection, they are only part of the cure.  the other part is the immune system.  if you use enough antibiotic to kill every last bit of the infection, you'll also kill most or all of the beneficial strains of bacteria which we need.  most bacteria found in the human body are beneficial or harmless bacteria.  very few actually make people sick.  but antibiotics will kill any bacteria that is structurally similar to the target infective strain.  as a result, the helpful bacteria may be wiped out and the person will feel worse as they can't perform certain body functions without bacteria.  so usually you take a dose of antibiotic three times a day to wipe out most of the parent cells (or just prevent them from reproducing), and then let your immune system concentrate it's efforts on the remaining harmful bacteria.  a few days worth of treatment will make the person feel much better, but if there is even one cell of resistant bacteria, the infection can come back as that cell reproduces exponentially.  the infection will be harder to beat the second time.  so continuing treatment for several days after improvement is noted is an extra precaution.  (source: any introductory biology text)\n\nmedicine is expensive.  when people are really sick, they don't work and therefore don't earn money.  (if they aren't really sick, they are less likely to seek medical care and therefore won't receive a prescription for antibiotics.)   if they don't start to feel better within a couple of days they probably have a resistant strain of bacteria (or their immune system is compromised) and need to switch to a more expensive, stronger antibiotic.  (source: medical statistics, bacterial life cycle for whatever specific strain interests you, common sense)  if there is no need for additional medication, why push for it?  it's a waste of money at best, and a way for the individual's condition to deteriorate, at worst.\n\nthe point is, if you start to feel a lot better two days after starting the medication, and completely normal within three days... taking antibiotics for twenty-seven more days will not provide more benefit than taking it seven more days, and will probably have negative consequences with regards to helpful bacteria.  just because you feel better, though, doesn't mean your infection is gone.  one bacterium doesn't make a person feel sick.  but one bacterium can turn into a million bacteria very quickly.  for example, under optimum conditions, escherichia coli can divide every 20 minutes.\n\nso let's say you have one e.coli cell.  in twenty minutes you have two.  in two hours you have over 4 billion.  so the antibiotic just makes the conditions less than optimum, either preventing "
3,"Question about Imipram?
My 12 year old nephew is on Imipram (25 mg) - 3 pills each night - can anyone tell me what this is for??  Supposedly it's for bed-wetting, however, what I find online is it is an antidepressant??
He's probably on it for bed-wetting.  It is an antidepressant, but it's not usually used for that purpose anymore as other drugs have since been developed that are more effective... but it is still used for bedwetting.   Apparently it causes the smooth muscle wall of the bladder to relax so that it can stretch to hold more urine without the need to urinate being as intense.  I took it for bedwetting when I was that age also, it's not 100% perfect, but it does help... although it isn't a cure, it just helps you get through the night when you take it, until your bladder grows enough to keep from wetting the bed on its own.\n\n   Good luck, I hope your nephew is able to grow out of it soon!"
1,"So how exactly did Jesus(sp?) turn water to wine?

He....   darn it.  I thought I had the recipe sitting here but I seem to have lost it.\n\nGeez, what kind of question is that any way?\n\nLet's assume for a minute that you are asking about a just a mundane operation like walking from one town to another.  The inclusion of the word ""exactly"" in a question about a 2000 year old event makes one wonder what your epistemelogical standard is.   \n\nThe quick and the dirty of the situation is, I don't know.  I think it probably did happen though. I'm not a fundementalist, so therefore it's not necessary for the New Testament accounts, in this case the Gospel of John, to be completly inerrant for me to sign on.  They just have to be generally historically accurate, like any other set of historical documents from the time.\n\nSome people's a priori commitment to pure materialism aside, the story seems to be authentic to me.  It has specific details that a good old propaganda story probably wouldn't contain.  Such as Jesus's disagreement with his mother and his consequent quip at her.  And then he actuallly does what she suggested.  Propaganda created from whole cloth would probably contain less contraversy in it.  \n\nThe Gospel of John is actually the New Testament book that we have the earliest documentary evidence of.  Part of it was found in the Nag Hammadi (sp?) library in Egypt and has been dated to about 130 a.d.   That's pretty darn close to the events described compared to most ancient historical documents that are considered authoritative."
7,"how much money could be generated in a week from a internet cafe with 10 to 15 computers in the philippines?

There are a lot of variables to consider.  Are you in a densely populated area?  How interested in computers is the general population?  What is your rental cost (the building you are in) and other expenses?  Licensing fees, etc.  Have you done a cost analysis?  Are you on a main thoroughfare or a side street?  Is your place of business easily accessible to the general public?  I go to this little E-Cafe since my computer crashed and they charge $2.00 an hour and they have only eight stations.  Most of the clientele stop in for a coffee and a pastry and check up on their E-mail and are gone in about 10-15 minutes.  Average customer spends $7 ($3 for the pastry, $2 for the coffee, $2 for the use of the computer).  Early morning and late afternoon traffic in there is pretty heavy.  Say $56 every 15 minutes, $224 an hour for say at least 5 hours a day, that's $1120.  They are open from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm (long day for a mom and pop store).  Things are a bit hard to come by in the Philippines being everything pretty much needs to be shipped in, so costs would be a bit higher I am supposing.  Having more computers would generate more income, so do the math and take it from there.\n\nYou could also sell magazines, newspapers, sodas, cookies, munchy stuff, but you'll need time to clean the keyboards and such.\n\nHope this helps and good luck."
1,"What does word ""testament"" or ""testimony"" mean?
Please define word origin since it is simliar to male anatomy or testes.
Actually they are related.\n\nTestis in Latin means a witness, one who attests something or even something that serves as proof; another use of the word is for testicle.\n\nThe testament (as in the New and Old, as well as your last will and...) means a pact, a promise a swearing of obligations.  Testimony, of course, is the recitation of facts to which you attest.\n\nIt seems that testis in the plural, testes (testicles), may be a specific use of the general term.  How did this happen?\n\nThere is an oft-repeated but little proved popular etymology that says testis and testimony are related because a Greek or Roman would have to 'swear by his testicles', that is to grip them and swear that his oath was true lest he lose his testicles.\n\nThis same story seems to be supported by the swearing of oaths in the Old Testament wherein Hebrews would swear by the 'yarek' or thigh.  This, though it seems prove the swearing by the testicles is still not a proven point. (Just like in English a generic term like 'thigh' can mean the thigh itself or be used euphemistically for the thigh area or even testicles.)\n\nWithout some other evidence to support the 'swearing by the testicles' idea, the most basic and therefore more likely explanation is that the testicles themselves are 'proof' of manhood, that is to say they show that a male is not a eunuch, and in the minds of the ancients, able to produce an heir. (A eunuch could still have a penis, therefore, there needs to be some other 'proof'.)\n\nThomas Talboy, PhD, Director\nUbiquity International, LLC\nExperience. Explore.
