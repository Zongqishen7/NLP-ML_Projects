"Would you rather get a gift that you knew what is is or one that is a complete surprise?

surprises... i always wait until Christmas morning while my brother opens them right away and has nothing to unwrap on Christmas... but i guess there's always that disappointment when you realize someone doesn't know you well enough to get you something you would actually like and would use.  still, surprises are the best."
"Is the internet ruining people's ability to communicate?
I've only been on this site for a week and I cannot believe how bad the grammar, spelling, etc. are.  I know that I'm not the best writer or public speaker, and I realize this is a very informal setting, but at least I can put a sentence together when I need to.  Reading some of the posts on this site is like deciphering sanscrit.  Should we be concerned about this?
I share your concern. Although some people here are not native English speakers, many appear to be from the U.S. and appear unconcerned about the basic tenets of written communicattion. I wonder if writing in such an informal manner will impact the way they communicate when it's important -- like in school or the workplace. I believe you can only learn to write well by practicing writing well. I think some students are in for a big shock when they get to college or enter the workplace because the ability to express yourself correctly, clearly, and succinctly is a major factor in success."
"Permanganate?
Suppose permanganate was used to test for reducing agents.Would permanganate likely cause more anions to behave as reducing agents or fewer?  Explain.
The (MnO4)- ion is a powerful oxidising agent, much more so than the mild oxidising agents sometimes used. So it will be able to oxidise more substances than mild oxidising agents will, that is, force more substances to be reducing agents."

"Has anyone purchased software to watch TV on your PC?
I am trying to find some software that I can use without getting a tuner or having cable, to watch TV on my PC when I travel. I'd like to know if anyone is currently using software like Inet-TV, if it works, and just how good it is.
I use internet TV software and it is great - AVerTV. We also use ESS.tv and Streamwire (just google them) where you pay a small fee and get to watch lots of shows."
"How do you get rid of hiccups?

Hiccup\n\nA hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced ""HICK-up"" (IPA: /ˈhɪ.kəp/) independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the ""hic"" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term ""hiccup"" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.\nIt is still unclear to scientists exactly why hiccups occur, particularly because it doesn't seem to give us any specific benefit. Some speculation exists that hiccups are a remnant of a bodily function that has been phased out by evolution, such as the move from aquatic gilled creatures to land animals. More research is required to ascertain their true nature, origins, and purpose, if any.\n\nHome remedies\nThe following are some commonly suggested home remedies. While numerous remedies are offered, they mostly fall into a few broad categories. These categories include purely psychosomatic cures centered around relaxation and distraction, cures involving swallowing and eating (with the rationale generally that this would remove irritants or reset mechanisms in the affected region), and cures involving controlled/altered breathing.\nWhile the first two categories may prove effective for many short lived and minor cases of hiccups, those suffering from an intractable case may become desperate sorting through various ineffective home remedies. Many of the cures centered around controlled breathing (i.e. holding breath) are often ineffective. The only underlying rationale could be the displacement of an irritated nerve through prolonged diaphragmatic expansion.\nHowever, one respiratory remedy has a fairly sound rationale underlying it. Breathing into a bag or small enclosed container (ensuring that it is completely sealed around the mouth and nose) induces a state that is termed respiratory acidosis. The effect is caused by increasing the amount of inspired carbon dioxide, which then increases the serum level of carbon dioxide. These increased levels of CO2 lower the pH in the blood, hence creating a state of acidosis. This state of acidosis produces vasodilation and depression of the central nervous system. The effect allows for increased blood flow to the affected muscles, and suppression of the aberrant nervous impulses. Inducing a state of acidemia through hyperventilation is particularly effective in curing hiccups because the diaphragm rests directly against the pulmonary vasculature that is then flowing with especially low pH blood. This is a potentially dangerous action; and should only be done with another person present. As the serum CO2 level rises abruptly, the person will begin to feel lightheaded and within a few minutes will pass out. If done without a spotter, the person might either injure him or herself as he or she passes out, or pass out in such a way that the bag or container continues to prevent oxygen intake (see also asphyxia).\nAdditionally, another respiratory remedy, while having no sound scientific principle behind it, is paradoxically one of the most effective in treating persistent hiccups. One breathes out all the air that they are able to in one long exhalation then breathes in all the air they feel they possibly can in one continuous inhalation. The person then attempts to b"

"In a case of a 30 year old female diabetic, how likely is it to be type 1 vs. type 2?

I think that someone can be type 1 and 2.  The question is whether they are insulin deficient or insulin resistant.  I hate thinking about things in black and white (He has purely type 1 and she has purely type 2) because in medicine things always occur on a spectrum.  Lets say you have a low grade auto immune disorder and your insulin production is decreased because of slow gradual lost of Beta cell function  over time. Wouldn't this be a type of type 1 dm.  And lets also say that you get a bit overweight and become insulin resistant.  So for the first 30 yrs of life,  you had enough insulin production but because you put on the weight you also become insulin resistant.  Then wouldn't you be type 1 and type 2 diabetic.  Remember life is never always that clear and simply.  The important thing is to diagnosis the diabetes early and control it so to prevent complications down the line."
"Bytes of memory: for Khristophoros?
I tried to answer your question, but you closed it too quick.  The human brain doesn't work like that, because the the system is not digital--it is analog.\n\nThe number of cells doesn't tell you bytes, because there is no one-to-one correspondance between number of axon-hillock depolarizations, synaptic vesicles being released, or the degree of depolarization or hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic cell.\n\nYou might as well ask how many bytes of inoformation encode the Mississippi River watershed, directing water to the sea.  You can get an answer, but it will be meaningless.
I know there isn't an exact measurment of memory capacity for the brain. I just wanted to know peoples opinions on what would be the equivalency if they could measure it. If there was an exact answer, cool. I should of clarified that in my question. Sorry for the mis-understanding."

"when we look the moon rising on the horizon, isn't it optically larger than when it is high in the sky? why?

It is just an optical illusion. Your brain apparently compares the moon (and the sun) with familiar objects around it and that makes it appear larger. If you took pictures and measured, you would see that there is no difference (we had to do this in school in grade 8, and there definitely is no size difference). \n\nThere are refraction effects when the moon and the sun is low in the horizon that distort their shape so they do not look spherical, or are no longer simply connected, or exhibit green flashes etc. But the size does not vary appreciably if they are high enough in the sky to be seen as circular disks."
"Can you get a loan on a house if you have a lot of student loan debt?
I am going to be going to school and taking out student loans. Can me and my husband still get a loan for the house.

"Abdominal pains.. nausea...?
Starting about 2 weeks ago i started to have gas, which is very uncommon for me. then last thursday i had constipated diarea if that makes since for about 2 days.  Around that same time i started getting really sick to my stomach with bad headaches too. I no longer have diarea but i am still constipated & sick to my stomach all day. I am having terrible stomach cramps that kind of feel like a period cramp. It started just on the left .It has now traveled across my stomach but is mostly in the under-belly-button region & i am still vomiting. I also have been very sensitive to smells. Even when i eat my stomach still feels empty like. when i tried having sex with my husband the other day and i seemed okay until we finished and it hit me like a ton of bricks and the pain was really severe.\nAnyone have any ideas on what could be cuasing this? \nAlso, i am very persistant on getting my BC shot.

"Molar concentrations and partial pressures?
0.856 g He, 16.910 g F2, and 15.000 g Ar are placed in a 13.8-L container at 53 degrees C. What are the molar concentrations and partial pressures of the gases?\n\nWhat is the total pressure in the container?\n\nChem homework. I'm stuck, please help me! Thanks.
Divide each mass by their molar weight to get the number of moles of each gas. 0.856g He/(4.003 g He/mole) = 0.214 mole of He. Do that for all the masses and add them up. I got a total of 1.034 moles. \nFrom that you could find the total pressure using PV=nRT.\nNext, find the mole fraction (I think this is the same as molar concentration) which is the # of moles of each gas/total number of moles.\nThen multiply each mole fraction by the total pressure to get each partial pressure. \nHope this helped. Let me know if you want me to go through each step."
"What is the Kb value of KOH?

Because KOH is virtually completely soluble, there is no real Kb value for it.  A Kb value is calculated by multiplying the concentrations of the ions that KOH forms in solution, then dividing that number by the concentration of actual KOH still bonded together in that solution, which is almost nothing.  Mathematicians will tell you that dividing by a number close to zero will give you a number very close to approaching infinity, so the Kb value for KOH that you find in any table or whatever will never give you a number; it will probably just say ""very large."""

NO they are not all symmetrical. There have been studies that prove that people who have symmetrical faces are more attractive that those who have little symmetry but ones that are too symmetrical are non-attractive.

"why does earth have a magnetic force?

First of we have to understand magnetism. All magnetic objects produce invisible lines of force that extend between the poles of the object. An easy way to visualize this is to spread iron filings on a sheet of paper and place a bar magnet under the paper. The iron filings will arrange themselves around the magnet and along the magnetic field lines.\n\nIn the simplest terms, Earth can be thought of as a dipole (2-pole) magnet. Magnetic field lines radiate between Earth's north and south magnetic poles just as they do between the poles of a bar magnet. Charged particles become trapped on these field lines (just as the iron filings are trapped), forming the magnetosphere.\n\nThe origin of the Earth's magnetic field is not completely understood, but it is generally believed to be associated with electrical currents produced by convective effects and rotation in the spinning liquid metallic outer core of iron and nickel. This mechanism is generally known as the dynamo effect. \n\nBecause of the rotating outer core, this then produces an electric current, which in turn, produces a magnetic field that is also known to interact with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field. Together, the two fields are stronger than the original and lie essentially along the axis of the Earth's rotation.\n\nHope this helps you out a little :)"

"How does the US economy work with such High Trade Deficit?

US trade deficit is too small compared to its GDP (nearly $12 trillion).  While trade deficit is a minor problem, global supply-demand will keep varying over the years and this could change the trade-deficit. Further, the deficit is paid by foreign investment, which means Americans aren't saving enough. When the interest rates are very low they won't save much money but spend it on commodities which includes importing from overseas. When the rates go up there is incentive to save it in term-deposits and other safe investments.  It is a tricky complex phenonmenon that will get resolved on its own with time but as of now it is not an alarming situation."

I play World of Warcraft, a MMORPG. I desire to learn how to roleplay a villain, or at least a villainous personality. Need some advice.
What is a villain?  A villain is someone who acts against the interests of others.  You can have your own interests that are perfectly legitimate.  For example, in the X-Men movies, Magneto is seen as a villain by humanity... but some mutants regard him as a hero.\n\nWhat are the interests of your fellow players?  How can you impede them?  What can you do that would benefit you while harming them?  \n\nStereotypically, villains are untrustworthy (breaking agreements, lying, cheating, etc); they hold little regard for human lives or resources.\n\nI would recommend befriending other players then turning on them when it is to your advantage.  Anything you cannot use, that other players might be able to?  Sell it to their enemies.  That way the players will be forced to deal with stronger opponents.\n\nDestroy anything of value that other players might be able to use... keeping the good stuff for yourself.\n\nBad Luck!"

1st Strep is Bacterial not viral and that's why you don't get immunity and you have to take Anti-biotic.  Your body can fight strep off by itself but the danger is it can recede into your joints and cause problems there.  So you may think it's gone and it's quietly damaging your body.  \n2nd I was told by my doctor that strep is actually something we carry in our bodies all the time.  This makes it easy to come down with a strep infection.\n\n3rd Kid's get it more then adults for a few reasons.  One is that schools are breeding grounds for communal disease.  By the time one child realizes they even have strep it's most likely been shared with 20 or more other kids.  Now not all 20 will get strep but a few will and they in turn will spread to others.  With adults you tend to have less close interaction with other adults daily."
"Catholics angry/disappointed in Pope John Paul  II?
As a Catholic, I am very disappointed in Pope John Paul  II and think he did a lousy job by covering up many priests pedophilia. He should not have taken church funds gained by donations/Sunday collection and used it as hush money. He should instead have kicked out the priests, filed criminal charges, and admitted the nasty sin and issued a public apology. He should have taken steps to ensure it never happens again and that all priests present and future submit for a psychological evaluation or at least be screened for a prior criminal record. If you cannot trust your priest with your child then who can you trust? I don't go to mass anymore as I cannot condone this abomination!
This is EXACTLY how you should feel and I don't blame you a bit. I'm not catholic, but I have been wondering the same things. Why aren't more people in an uproar about this??"

"Does anyone have an idea....?
I am a 9th grader and we have to do a project (in biology) to be entered in the science fair. I had an idea but someone has already thought of it can some one please help me i am stuck in my own thoughts. Answers are appreciated. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\n-Kia B
I think a good biology project would be to perform an actual medical procedure during the science fair.\n\nI have a few ideas.  One: you could find a volunteer and surgically remove his appendix.  While a scalpel would be ideal for this, any old sharp piece of metal would work.  This would demonstate many biological principles, and would no doubt get you an A.\n\nIf you can't find a suitable volunteer, you could always demonstrate childbirth.  You'll need to have someone impregnate you, and it would be best to do so 9 months or so before the science fair, so you'll have to get ready for this one well in advance.\n\nThese days labor can be easily induced so that the birth takes place during the science fair.  I think the teachers will be quite impressed with your dedication and commitment to biological science and will give you the highest possible grade.\n\nEither one of these would be a decent choice, pick the one which appeals most to you personally."

"in what ways can pride hide itself in us?

Pride hides in us when we believe we are wise ""in our own eyes"" and are unteachable.  We get angry when people correct us.  Zealous christians are often very prideful \nthat they know the Bible and they are right and others are wrong, even fellow christians.\n\nWe become proud when become fault finders, have a harsh unloving spirit, become offended easily, need to be seen or need attention.\n\nProverbs 16:18 (NKJV)  \n    Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. \n\nWe must remember Romans 3:23 (NKJV)  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"
"I will open a bussiness doing errands for people.How do I start it and how much can I charge for the service?

I would develop a shopping/errand contract for you and your customers.\n\nThis contract can keep track of the deposit, the list, and the allotted time for the shopping and errands. I would allow 2 hrs per customer depending on how much they need done.\n\nAnd you should also have a flat fee of $8.95-$15.95. Your fees should be based on time, which day, and the work load.\n\nAnd I would shop for more than one person at a time, that way you kill 2 or 3 customers at a time and save time and money.\n\nMaybe hire you kid or someone part time to help you. You should market to parents and the elderly. \n\nAnd have your customers write/print out detailed list. With brand names, amounts/sizes, quantities, and which store they would like for you to shop at.\n\nAnd get your money first and then you can give them the receipt and change later. That way you don't risk paying for someone else groceries.\n\nAnd make sure you put your customers on mailing list so that you can always promote your business and any new offers to them.\n\nI hope this helps you and if you need help with coming up with a contract I'd be more than willing.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!!"
"I like a guy at my gym and want to ask him out but I dont want to be embarresed if he dosent like me in return
I like this guy at my gym he works there and seems really shy and I am a shy natured person myself, But I want to ask him out . I think I will be heart broken If he does not like me in return. I want to save face because I work out there at least five days a week. I want to strike up some general converstation with him . What should I say I dont want to come off as a freek that just wants to jump his bones but I want to let him know that I am interested in him  in a low key way. Just in case he is in a relationship or does not feel the same way about me as I feel about him I can still save face seeing that I still want to workout at this gym five days a week.
If he's a trainer there, then strike up a conversation with him regarding different workout routines.  Then ask him if he would like to go out for a smoothie sometime to talk over more workout stuff (wink wink) and if he does great when you're out and about you can talk about other stuff and get a feel for him.\n\nIf he says no, for whatever reason - I don't go out with people from the gym, I have a girlfriend etc... - say ""well - we don't need to go out - If you can just set aside some time to show me some more techniques I'd really appreciate it.""\n\nThat way - you make it seem that the only reason you asked him out was to talk about your workout and you save face."
"Christians: Are tattoos wrong?
In the New Testament, it says not to mark your body with tattoos, but it also says not to eat pork. I got a Crown of Thorns tattooed on the back of my neck and I eventually want to get ""Jesus is King"" in Aramaic underneath it. One of my pastors is supportive, the other tells me I should really think about what I'm doing.
Wow I was actually thinking about getting a crown of thorns on my lower back right above the Hebrew tattoo I have, but I'm not sure yet how I want it.  (Could you send me a pic of yours?) ANyway I think that's awesome.\n\nBut in general I am a Christain and I like tattoos(depending on what they are of course).  \n\nThe only verse in the bible I know of tht mentions tattoos is in Leviticus.  If you read the entire chapter, or the book, you'll find that in that passage, it has a bunch of rules like don't mix crops, or wear clothes with different types of fabric, and lots of other things.  At the time God was specifically addressing the Israelites.  His purpose was to establish them as His.  At the time they were in the desert preparing to go into diferent lands filled with different idol worshipers.  God wanted His people to stand out as seperate.\n\nOf course all that was in the Old Testament. Alot has changed since then.  Now God sets us apart by filling us with the Holy Spirit (Acts Ch. 2).  Also people in the Old Testament were bound by the law, which included all kinds of specific rules.  But when Jesus came and died, we were released from the law and we are now under a new covenant with God, a covenant of grace (not the law).  Read Romans, it pretty much explains it.\n\nAnyway, some Christains will argue, but I personally have prayed about it and don't feel conviction about my tattoo, and niether does my husband. In fact both of us have tattoos that express our faith in Christ and we have had many opportunities to share our testiminies because of them. So I think it's great.  But the best thing I can tell you is to just pray and ask God to convict you if you are wrong.  If you do feel conviction, then repent and don't get anymore, but if not, then don't worry what anyone says.  After all God alone is the judge.  Again I would encourage you to read the book of Romans.\n\nMany blessings :)"

"how bacteria makes a person sick?

Bacteria can make a person sick.  But alot of problems come from bacteria that have been destroyed and can't protect us from the harmful bacteria.  For instance yeast infections are almost always caused by a lack of the normal flora of bacteria.  60% of all you vitamin K that is used for blood clotting comes from bacteria in your gut.  But the three main ways that they cause you to get sick is.\n\n1.  The natural flora is destroyed and a ""bad"" bacteria or yeast can flourish.  If this happens then it goes to step 2.\n\n2.  The bacteria when it eats nutrients in your blood or body it produces toxins as a byproduct.\n\n3.  Or it can actually attack certain cells in your body and can cause harm that way.\n\nSomething that is common in older people is that they come in with an infection and the Dr. prescribes a powerful antibiotic called Rocephin.  This wipes out the normal flora of the intestines and the person comes down with Clostridium Diff.  They then prescribe a more powerful antibiotic called Vancomyacin.  This seems to quell the C. Diff. but then they get yeast infections because there is no bacteria to protect them.  The bacteria eventually develope a resistant strain called VRE to help combat the void left in the intestine and by this time the person is usually very ill because of the yeast infections and C. Diff.  They then develope a Urinary Tract infection by the VRE and develope sepsis and then die."

"Acid-base titration with an unknown purity solute... how to find purity/mass?
Used .911 and .950 g of unknown purity KHP and 22.60 ml and 22.00 ml NaOH to titrate. Not sure how to find the mass of KHP in the unknown solute. If someone could help, that would be great!
First off, you need the concentration of the NaOH solution.  From that you can determine the number of moles of NaOH that were used.  This is equal to volume (V) time the concentration, in mol/L (C).\nn = V * C = 0.02260 L * ? mol/L = ? mol\nn = 0.02200 L * ? mol/L = ? mol\n\nThe reaction of KHP (C8H5O4K) and NaOH is this:\nHOOC-C6H4-COOK + NaOH -> NaOOC-C6H4-COOK + H2O\nSo, 1 mol of NaOH will react with 1 mol of KHP.\nThat means that the number of moles of NaOH you calculated above is also equal to the number of moles of KHP.\nThe molecular weight of KHP is 12*8 + 1*5 + 16*4 + 39 = 204 g/mol\nMultiply that by the number of moles: 204 g/mol * ? mol = g actual KHP\n\nYou can divide that number by the 0.911 and 0.950 g and then multiply by 100% to find the purity.\n\nHere’s an example if your NaOH solution was 0.1 M (M means ‘molar,’ or mol/L):\nn = 0.02260 L * 0.1M = 0.002260 mol of NaOH = 0.002260 mol of KHP\n204 g/mol * 0.002260 mol of KHP = 0.461 g pure KHP\n0.461 g pure KHP / 0.911 g impure KHP * 100% = 50.6 % KHP\n\nHope this helps!"

"what do scientists think what substance quark s are made of?
which came first the quark of the electron?
There are some theories that suggest that quarks and leptons are composed of smaller ""fundamental"" particles known as Preons or Rishons (depending on the theory you read). The rishon theory nicely shows why electrons and quarks always have a charge that's a multiple of e/3 by having the same rishons or antirishons inside them.\n\nAlso they have a hypercolour property similar to the colour property of quarks that explains why the particles we see (leptons or confined quarks) always have an integer multiple of e charge.\n\nThese theories also have downsides too, such as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle stating that a particle that small must have a large amount of energy, which is more than the mass of an electron!"

"Do you know everyone on earth with some kind of sick is curse and is going with Satan?
Haleluya Praise God.
In ancient Jewish tradition Satan is simply an angel doing the work that God assigned to Satan to do. \n\nThe word Satan means challenger. With the idea of Satan challenging us, or tempting if you will. This description sees Satan as the angel who is the embodiment of man's challenges. This idea of Satan works closely with God as an integral part of Gods plan for us. His job is to make choosing good over evil enough of a challenge so that it becomes clear to us that there can be only one meaningful or logical choice.\n\n Contrast this to Christianity, which sees Satan as God's opponent. In Jewish thought, the idea that there exists anything capable of setting itself up as God's opponent would be considered polytheistic or setting up the devil to be an equally powerful polarity to god or a demigod.\n\nOddly, proof for The Christian satan/devil mythology is supposedly found in the ancient Jewish texts that were borrowed to create the bible. One can’t help but wonder how Christians came up with such a fantastically different interpretation of Gods assistant Satan in their theology.\n\nOther hints about Satan’s role in human relations can be seen if you look at the name Lucifer. It’s meaning in the original tongue translates as Light bearer or light bringer. Essentially the bringer of enlightenment. The temptations of the Satan idea bring all of us eventually into Gods light. Hardly the Evil entity of Christian mythology.\n\nLove and blessings\ndon"
"Why is it so hard to get a child to write a thank you card?

Children don't have the same mental reasoning skills as adults.  They simply cannot understand WHY writing a thank-you card is so important, particularly because they don't care whether or not THEY receive a thank-you card when they give a gift to one of their friends.  Little kids pick their noses and eat it too, because they haven't developed the mental reasoning skills required to understand societal and cultural norms.  As long as you continue to set a good example and pressure them into writing the cards, eventually they will grow into young adults who recognize the importance of doing so."

Coyotes are quiet and shy during the day, but busy hunters at night.  When it gets dark they begin howling like crazy...are they looking for a mate, or is this just a way of communicating?
Yes, from what I understand, coyotes use all of their senses of sight, smell, touch and hearing to communicate. \n\nThey are highly vocal mammals, using 3 distinct calls: squeaks, distress calls, and howl call, which consist of a quick series of yelps, followed by a high-pitched howl. Howling may act to announce where their territory is to other packs. \n\nCoyotes also howl when two or more members of a pack re-unite and to announce to each other where they are. \n\nLots more info here:"

"Tanning Bed Advice needed!!!!?
I have never been to a tanning bed before. I need to get tan by May 20th, how do I do this safely and how long do I go for the 1st time?
I've kept my skin soft by NOT tanning all these years, but I've got a natural pigmentation to my skin most people don't (half Native American, half Italian).  Olay has now come out with a new lotion that gives the skin a touch of color, and being lotion and not a tanning spray, its reported by them not to streak.  It's called ""Touch of Sun"".  But if you need a tan because of being in a wedding, or something similar, I suggest getting a sprayed on tan all over.  It's safer for the skin, and lasts about 3 to 4 days.  IF this is because you're going on vacation and need it because you'll be out in the sun, just be careful...wear a light sunscreen so you don't burn, and take it slowly.

"Anyone have ideas on how to soothe a sore throat caused by radiation beam therapy to the neck?
We tried sprays to numb the throat, but he can't open his mouth wide enough to get the spray into the throat. (also lozenges, but they only take the edge off)\n\nHe is not able to eat like he should and in lots of pain. He is losing lots of weight, and still has about 6 weeks of treatment left. \n\nThe radiation team is trying to find something to help. What they have recommended so far, has not helped.
I am a Radiation Therapist, so I have a pretty good handle on this one.  Extreme pain and dificulty swallowing ar ethe two most common (and awful) side effects of radiation therapy to the neck area.  Lidocaine spays are sometimes effective but difficult once a patient reaches a certain level of pain.  The most common treatment for this is often called ""magic mouthwash"".  It can be made up at your local pharmacy but will require a prescription.  It is a mixture of viscous lidocaine (to numb the throat), liquid benadryl (to lessen swelling) and liquid Maalox (to leave a soothing coating.  The effect is temporary (about 2 hours) but will allow him to at least eat some soft foods.   A second option is a painkiller lollipop (really) called Aqtiq. It is just narcotic in a sugar base but has shown some relief to local tissue.  The third suggestion is to get access to a mouth wash with a benzydamine base. This has not been approved in the US but is available in Canada over the counter, so you may be able to order it from an online pharmacy.  I worked on the clinical trial in the US and the benzydamine mouthwash helped to decrease the effect of radiation on the mucosal (inside the mouth and throat) tissue in patients being treated for head and neck cancer with radiation.\n\nAs a side note, your radiation oncology nurse should be carefully monitoring his weight.  If he is unable to take solid food, you should be supplementing his diet with high calorie meal replacement shakes like Ensure. If you can't afford these, very often the company can provide low or no cost supplies while he is being treated.  Please ask your oncology nurse or the department social worker to help you with these resources.  As a last resort, a PEG (feeding tube surgically placed BELOW the area being treated)  can be temporarily placed to allow him to receive adequate nutrition whil ehe is being treated and until the treated area heals.\n\nGood luck."

"What is a Business Process and Business process Excellance?

A business process is a recipe for achieving a commercial result. Each business process has inputs, method and outputs. The inputs are a pre-requisite that must be in place before the method can be put into practice. When the method is applied to the inputs, then certain outputs will be created.\n\nA business process is a collection of related structural activities that produce something of value to the organization, its stake holders or its customers. It is, for example, the process through which an organization realizes its services to its customers.\n\nA business process can be part of a larger, encompassing process and can include other business processes that have to be included in its method. In that context a business process can be viewed at various levels of granularity. The linkage of business process with value generation leads some practitioners to view business processes as the workflows which realize an organization's use cases.\n\nA business process can be thought of as a cookbook for running a business; ""Answer the phone"", ""place an order"", ""produce an invoice"" might all be examples of a Business Process.\n\nA business process is usually the result of a business process design or business process reengineering activity."

For example, when a bank says you get 5 percent interest (apr) compounded monthly and added to ur account quarterly..does that mean..they take that 5 percent divide it by 12 (months) and that comes out to 0.00417 percent a month..so that means if i put 1000 in the bank. 0.00417 of that is 4.17 so now i have 1004.17 after the first month.then the second month they take 0.00417% of 1004.17 which is 4.19 and then add that and then its 1008.36 and then by the third month they add the interest accumulated by that time into ur principle amount (1000) and this continues the same way for as long as you keep that money in your savings?

i agree with shermanbobby.  that's the story i've heard.  in addition to the marks of the wounds of the crucified Jesus being on each of the four dogwood flowers, the dogwood is a spindly tree that hardly ever gets above 20 feet tall and rarely over 6 inches across in the trunk area.  and there's hardly a straight part on the tree---it goes off in so many zigs and zags that you could never make a cross out of it again---just not enough straight wood in the whole tree."

"why do we as women try to dress 20 when we are twice that age?
be proud of age, very happy ur body still loooks good. but do u have to show to every one. to know u loook good. smile and be confident dont lower ur self for some one to appreciate u.yes be sexy, not trashy. just a opinion.
Because you do not want to be 40, you want to be 20.  i am 21 now and i see my mother trying to buy the things i buy, but she looks much more beautiful and graceful (and less in denial of her 40ish age) when she wears clothes from the womens department vs. the juniors dept.  its awful when an older woman tries to act like she's 20something.  i think, get over it and enjoy life in the now instead of in the past.  i guess when older women dress ""sexy"" -as they like to call it-  they don't know that people see right thru them.  and some even laugh at them.  dress like the grown, radiant woman you are and do not be ashamed of being wiser than us 20somethings!  lol"
"Is it possible for a gay male over 40, to find love?

It is possible for anyone of any age to find love.\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is, ""what am I looking for?""\n\nAre you passing up opportunities for a potentially lasting, loving relationship because you are searching for the ideal\nman, the muscle bound guy, the exceptionally groomed and porn star model looks?  Are you thinking yeh, this guy is great, but there might be the next best thing around the corner?  Are you looking for that someone that in a crowd everyone would be envious of you with him on your arm?\n\nSo many guys complain they cannot find love, when the possibilities are right next to them, because they see themselves with an ideal that exists only in magazines or in porn, so many guys sell themselves short.\n\nand it is not directed at just you , it is also on the other side someone might feel the potential with you , but still hold onto the idea of this perfect image.\n\nSo really know what you want in a person.  It will happen."

"Eating Disorder?
When people who don't have a schedule for each meal and kind of eat whenever they feel hungry.  Does that sound like having eating disorder?
That does not sound like an eating disorder. An eating disorder is characterized by either refusing to eat at all; eating and then vomiting; using laxatives excessively so food won't get digested; that sort of thing. Eating when you're hungry is a good thing--no matter what time of day it is, no matter if you have a schedule or not."
"Anyone truly comprehend the following?
If there were no God (which I don't personally believe), can you comprehend the complexity of there being no universe (meaning before the universe was created)?\nBefore the big bang there were no molecules, no atoms, no time, not even the thoughts of a higher being (God) or an existence on a nother level (heaven). You can't even say there was ""nothing"", because nothingness is something. \nEvery time i try and contemplate that last line, I feel a zap-like sensation in my mind...like my mind hit the reset button.
I totally know what you mean. I used to think about that all the time, but I would just exhaust myself. I think the only sure thing we know is that we know nothing. I am a bit of an agnostic, but certainly don't think that everything just happened by chance. Was there ever nothing? If so how did we ever get something?

"I developed a BAD habit.?
I drink nyquil everynight to fall asleep. I'm having some problems with my ""daily"" life and think about too much and can't sleep. Now the dosage I drink has doubled and almost tripled. Any suggestions as to what I should do? Other then seeing a doctor.
I got hooked on Nyquil for a month or two myself. I used to use it because I couldn't go to sleep at night and I knew I had to wake up early for work. Your right though after a while, your body builds a tolerance to it, so you have to increase the dosage to get the same effect. I know its bad to substitute one evil over another but to combat this I started smoking a lil bit of ""weed"" at night.\n\nI then thought well shi* this isn’t right either, so I started listening to meditation tapes about an hour before I went to bed. I would take a nice hot shower, (have an orgasm by means of sex or masturbation) and also make sure to avoid all forms of caffeine past a certain time in the day. Avoid chocolates and sugar too might help a bit. After about a week of doing this I didn’t need Nyquil again..\n\n\nGood luck=)\n\nOH YEAH: If all else fails find a really boring guy to talk to at night on the phone, might help too lolz.."
"How does the charge of a particle affect the direction in which the particle is deflected in a magnetic field?

negatively charged particles will go toward the positive end of the magnetic field and positively charged particles will go toward the negative end... for two reasons, because the positive is both repelled by the positive part of the field, and its also attracted by the negative end.  oh, and on diagrams, the arrows of magnetic flux usually go from negative to positive."

"at a constant temperature,the behavior of a sample of a real gas more closely approximates that of an ideas ga
at a constant temperature,the behavior of a sample of a real gas more closely approximates that of an ideas gas as its volume is increased because
questioner didnt say the gas becomes ideal when volume is increased. he said it MORE CLOSELY approximates.\n\nthis is due to a pressure decrease at constant temperature. (boyle's law). less pressure, atoms further apart, less intermolecular attractions.\n\ncomplete absence of intermolecular forces is a required term in ideal gas principle. so reducing the force obviously creates a more ideal gas."
"which is best - a country egg or an artificially inseminated egg; in terms of nutrition?

An egg produced by ""natural means"" or by ""artificial insemination"" are exactly the same.  The only difference would come by what the hen was eating during the developement of the egg.  If she is commercially used to lay eggs, then she is fed a chicken scratch and corn diet.  If she is free range then she eats whatever she finds on the ground (worms, bugs, seeds).  In which case the free range hen would have a more flavorful egg regardless of how the egg was started."
"why does everyonet think that tongues is only a spritual gift. it is the evidence of the holy ghost with out?
it you cant make it to heaven
I agree that speaking in tongues is not just a spiritual gift, but is something that evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit.  Once someone is baptized in the Holy Spirit, they should be able to speak in tongues.\n\nThere is a difference between the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit ""tongues"" and the spiritual gift of speaking in other tongues.  The Holy Spirit baptism ""tongues"" that anyone is capable of doing is an unknown spiritual language between you and God that cannot be translated, here's a scripture:\n\n""For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries."" (1 Cor. 14:2)\n\nThe spiritual gift of speaking in other tongues is normally meant to be interpreted by someone else who has the gift of interpreting other tongues, for the purpose of instructing the Church.  Here's the scripture for this:\n\n""I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification."" (1 Cor. 14:5)"
"how many fundamental particles are known?

Good question. It depends on whether you count exchange particles (ie particles associated with the fundemental forces of nature), if you count antiparticles, and which particle physics model you are using.\n\nIn the ""Standard Model"" of particle physics there are the follwing fundemental particles (the word's in CAPTIALS are the type of particle):\n\nLEPTONS:\nelectron, muon, tau.\nelectron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino.\n\nQUARKS:\nup, charmed, top.\ndown, strange, bottom.\n\nGAUGE BOSONS:\nphoton, W+, W-, Z0 (note the +, - and 0 are superscripts)\n8 different gluons.\n\nand finally... the Higgs Boson (still undiscovered).\n\nThis doesn't count antiparticles, of which there are 12 (6 anti-leptons and 6 anti-quarks).\n\n\nSome theories introduce a whole host of new particles, but none of these extra particles have been discovered either."
"Can lightening occur during a snow storm?

It is possible but it is quite rare. Here's why.\n\nA thunderstorm depends on rapidly rising  moist warm  air to produce the effects we see. These effects are: large volumes of rain in a short period of time, strongly gusting winds, hail, and of course lightning. When conditions aren't right (surface air is too cool and dry) it is impossible for air at the surface to rise fast and high enough to create a thunderstorm cell. Basically in winter the air is not warm or moist enough to produce thunderstorm cells.\n\nFor a deeper explanation check the source site."

To love someone, you must put their needs before your own and vice versa.  Real love is reciprocal.  True love is rare and must be worked on and nurtured.  If you are looking for romantic love, find someone not only with common interests, but someone who compliments you.  My husband is really laid back and I am high strung, so I motivate him and he helps calm me down."

"Doctors &/or surgeons please?
I had a hysterectomy back in July and I know there is still healing going on. I am a surgical asst. so I understand the anatomy and procedure and limitations, but I still have a question. I'm 34, in good health, reason for surgery was uncontrollable bleeding and endometriosis, and pelvic pain. My husband has a large penis and I continue to have painful intercourse. Is it possible that the cervical cuff can not accomidate his size, or is it just part of the healing process?
Although I concur with my colleague, Doc8, that it is entirely possible for you to have remaining endometrial implants, I would disagree that your complaint pattern is suggestive of endometriosis pain.\n\nIn a hysterectomy, the uterus, including the cervix, is removed.  The upper edge of the vaginal cuff which remains is sewn shut in a ""purse-string"" fashion.  There is necessarily some loss of length within the canal because of tissue removal and the suture line involving even more tissue.  \n\nThe vagina is normally a highly compliant organ, which can stretch by length or diameter without much resistance.  However, after a hysterectomy, the former location of the uterus above the vaginal pouch is occupied by a raw space which fills with fibrous scar.  Scar tissue has a series of phases it goes through and for many many months, it is NOT compliant.  During the maturation phase of this scar tissue, I could easily envision that the normal compliance of your vagina has changed.  Now, there is significant resistance to stretch.\n\nThis is, of course, a guess.  However, the time period over which scar tissue matures and softens is well in excess of a year.  If my guess is wrong, then you'll know in about 6 to 12 more months when the problem still hasn't gone away.  \n\nIn the mean time, I would humbly suggest that you appeal to the basic principle of country doctoring:  If it hurts, DON'T DO IT! :)\n\nI hope that helps."

"Why are sugars and salts such good food preservatives?
anyone? i'm looking but i can't find much..
because of osmosis.  If you have a semi-permeable membrane separating a low level of salt solution and a high level of salt solution water will always travel toward the side with a higher concentration until it reaches equilibrium (the concentration is the same on both sides).  this is the case with bacteria or any other cell.  the cell membrane is semi-permeable.  If the bacteria lands on something that is very salty or very sugary the water will move from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell to try to reach equilibrium.  The cell will shrivel and die because the water will be leaving it.  There are very few bacteria that can withstand this.  (of course there are some that can, there is ALWAYS an exception in biology)"
"Why do some people here nitpick others spelling?
You've all seen it, I think- the arrogant 'perfect' type who's first sentence is 'learn to spell' or some such.  My question to those people is- WHY?  Has it not occured to you that some of them might be from countries where English is not the first language?  Moreover, what constructive purpose does it serve and how does it address the original question?  I can't help but think that those who attack other people's spelling online are doing so to hide serious confidence problems of their own...
Because in a written medium, writing is all we see of another's personality.\n\nIf a guy I was talking to on the street - no matter how interesting the conversation - suddenly started speaking in a heavy Creole dialect that I couldn't understand, I might mention it. In fact, I'm pretty darned certain that I would mention it!\n\nTypos and spelling errors, IMO, aren't that big a deal, so I don't point them out as a rule. If someone is misusing a word I might ask, ""Do you mean thisword? In that case I think . . ."" as a way of letting them know politely.\n\nbt i gota tl u dat wen i c a centnc lik dis, i skp d intir post.

If they're just playing one-up, I may learn something, but they lose my respect.\n\nAnother reason, I think, is that some of us simply love language. Here's something I wrote which shows how I feel:\n\nAmerican English is a beautiful language, though many Brits would laugh at the suggestion. It’s a fluid language, growing and evolving as fast as our upstart country itself. It’s spoken in a symphony of accent, idiom and dialect, sung on street corners and in opera houses, the child of many parents. It takes what it needs from this or that language to round itself out; it’s vibrant and alive.\n\nOf course the spell checker isn't working, so no doubt I've made errors! Ain't it always the way?"
"What are T-shaped molecules derived from?
Are T-shaped molecules derived from Trigonal Bypiramidal shape or from Triognal Planar? I had thought they were derived from the former one but somebody told me that though they are one kind of trigonal bypiramidal they are derieved from trigonal planar.
T-shaped molecules cannot be from trigonal planar because the only angles possible in a trigonal planar arrangement are 120 degrees, and T-shaped have a 180/90 angle difference.  This is possible for trigonal bipyramidal molecules because you would have two atoms at the axial positions and one equatorial, leaving you with two lonepairs in the other equatorial positions and a 180/90 angle difference between atoms around the central atom."

"What is the difference between the net asset and total asset of a company?

No.  That's totally and utter jibberish.  Your first tip that the previous answer is wrong is that taxes and expenses are not even on the balance sheet.  Secondly, liabilities are credited, not debited.  Third, well... third is that it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nHere's what it is...\n\nThe difference is basically between ""US"" and ""UK"" style presentation of the balance sheet.\n\nThe UK uses ""Net Assets"", which is assets minus liabilities on one side balanced by equity on the other side.  The balance sheet balances, but it basically analyzes it from an equity holder's perspective (e.g. ""where did my money go?"")\n\nThe US uses ""Total Assets"", which is assets.

Don't take it personally (if you are a Satanist, that is), they just don't know any better.\n\nThough I have to admit some confusion: why would anyone choose a symbol that to most people means something evil?

The reduction is proportional to the amount of time by which you fall short of 2 years.  So, if you satisfied 80% of the holding period, your exemption would be $200,000 (or $400,000)."
"Can energy cause gravitational attraction when its in a form other than binding energy?
If mass causes a gravitational attraction and mass is energy, can energy cause gravitational attraction when it isn't in the form of binding energy?\n\nIs it only when it's binding energy or are there other examples?\n\nI'm trying to get my head around the Friedmann equation of the early universe when it seems to be treating the energy of the photon dominated universe as having a gravitational attraction.
Yes, energy can cause a gravitational attraction (or repulsion - cosmological constant not equal to zero), via a distortion in spacetime. This is because of the energy tensor in the gravitational field equations, namely:\nG(uv)=8*pi*T(uv).\n\nThe most obvious example of energy distorting spacetime would be that which is carried off by gravy waves, due to for example, a neutron star orbiting a massive black hole. The LIGO and other detectors are trying to detect these waves. Hope this answers your question! ;-)"
"How fast is Electricity?
Electricity appears to bring instant power.  But it must take a measurable amount of time to go from ON  to Off.\nIf you had a switch and a light millions of miles apart but could see them both at the  same time, would it still appear instant?\nWould the answer be the same  even if the link between them was a perfect conductor of electricity?
The speed of the propagation of the electric field within a wire is limited by the speed of light.  Information cannot travel faster than light, so if you switched on a light bulb millions of miles away it would take a very noticeable lag before you see the light come on.\nFirst the electricity must travel down the wire at a speed no faster than c, then the light emitted by the bulb must return at c.\n\nIt is important to note that although the influence of the electric field propagates at the speed of light, the electrons making up the electric current do not travel this fast themselves since they have mass.  The individual electrons in the current carrying wire travel much more slowly.  The electrons that go ""into"" one end of the wire are not the same electrons that ""come out"" of the other end."

"Does other animals like birds and fishes have hymen?

Claim: Hymens are an aquatic trait. \n\nFact: Besides humans, hymens are found in lemurs (fellow primates, you'll note), guinea pigs, mole rats, hyenas, horses, llamas, and fin whales. Except for fin whales, none of these mammals are aquatic.  Also, AATers suggest that the reason for a hymen in humans was to seal off the female reproductive organs from waterborne parasites and such; but since the hymen is generally absent from the time of first intercourse (and very often before) this protection wouldn't be available for much of the female's lifespan.\n\nSo if by fihes you mean fin whales yes they do :D\n\nEDIT\nSo you know AAT stands for Aquatic Ape Theory"
"if a 5yrold has magnettoys and now my trinitron has purple and green in 2 corners, what do i do?
i think he got close enough and tried some kind of 'magik trik'.
Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with your monitor/TV.  It will likely be like this for a while ... you can also take it to a TV repair shop (call a Bust Buy, Circut City or Radio Shack as well) ... for a few bucks or like for free, they'll literally wave a little wand around it to reset the magnetic waves ... that's all it is.  I did the same thing to my TV and was actually playing around with a magnet right before I was getting ready to pitch it and I mysteriously fixed it myself !  \n\nYou might try that ... it's not causing any permanent harm, but if it get's frustrating, take it in someplace and tell them what happened, it will take them like 4 seconds to fix it and they won't even have to touch it !\n\nGood luck.\n\n-- Alan"

"Worried about my little brother?
I'm realy worried about my little brother, he's only 6 and my mum took him to the dentist the other day and my mum's just told me that the dentist wants him to go to the hospital and have an operation because his teeth are all rotten. He has to have a lot of them pulled out and he has to get caps on the rest because they are all so bad. He cries a lot at night because his teeth hurt him, but I'm scared that if he goes to the hospital he might die because my friend's sister went to the hospital and she was getting an operation and she died and she was 10 and my brother is only 6. Can we not make his teeth better without him having to have an operation?
Hi honey. It's understandable that you're scared, especially with your friend's sister dying, but you really need to try not to worry about this. I don't know what operation your friend's sister had, but operations on teeth are usually very quick and don't cause any problems. If he's crying because his teeth hurt him, they must be really sore and I'm sure you want him to feel better quickly. You said in a different question that you'd had cavities before, so you'll know what it's like getting fillings and things like that - don't you think it would be better for your little brother to just go to sleep and wake up with his teeth sorted? I think you should tell your mum about your worries so that she can help you, and you should make sure you set a good example to your little brother by making sure you take good care of your own teeth. Please don't worry, I'm sure your little brother is going to be absolutely fine."
"How many minutes would the energy taken to power up a typical lightbulb, light that lightbulb for when lit?
What would it be for various wattages, and energy saving lightbulbs? \nIm talking about the power required to take the bulb from off to on. So for example, the power required to switch a 40W lightbulb from off to on, would light that bulb, when lit, for X minutes. \n(Therefore if I am going to leave a room for less than X mins, it it not worth switching off the light)
depends on the type of bulb, For incadesant bulbs thee is NO extra power required, they get hot, they glow. For florescent tubes it can be quite long, certainly of the orer of hours. once up and running they use very little"

"what is an epic poem?

Oh, golly. This takes me back to high school. If I remember right, an epic is characterized by three things: Length, purpose, and content.\n\nEpics are narrative style, telling a story. The story is culturally significant, and takes a long time to make the point. The Illiad/Oddessy poem, for example, explained to early Greeks how their civilization was unfied for the first time and how the gods played a part in the process. The Aenead, on the other hand, gave evidence to Romans that their ruling family had been divinely selected from the distant past."

"how do you become more emotional?
my psychiatriest wants me to work on being more emotional befor she gives me pills. so my goal this week to to at least once a day analive my mood. and she said neutral is not a mood. she also gave me a cheat sheet to help me out.\n\nso what do you have to say? \ndo you know any ways for me to be more emotional?\nany thing you say may be of use.
Look at some charity websites and see if there are any causes that stir your sympathies, such as ones where a tiny amount of cash would make children safer and happier (as an example, see water aid link, a charity that digs wells so that women and girls in Africa don't have to spend up to 5 hours a day fetching disease-ridden water).\n\nIf you're feeling depressed and unemotional, it can be because you have problems in your life that you think are insoluble. Its really difficult to get motivated when you think a problem is impossible to solve. Often, solving a small problem or two lifts your mood.\n\nChat to people in your everyday life or online and pay attention to your words. Emphasise emotional, emphatic words like 'really', as in 'I REALLY like italian food' or 'I would LOVE TO visit mexico'. Think if the things you are passionate about. Which celebraties of the opposite sex do you wish you could meet? Are you a keen supporter of a sports team?\n\nFor most problems that you face (such as unemployment, relationship problems, berievement, addications, mental health problems, dealing with memories of bad things in your past, etc), you're not the first person to suffer it, thousands of people have had the same problem and know some good solutions. Ask questions on here about specific problems, search previous answers or google for articles.\n\n'Count your blessings' is a bit cliched, but some things to be grateful for are :-\n\nYou live in one of the richest countries on earth, you have friends and family, food, water, shelter, education, free-speech, freedom to travel, freedom to choose your own friends, free information on the net on anything you like, access to helpful people online, etc. Add you own things to this list.\n\nAs well as medication, cognitive therapy might help, a talking cure with a therapist. If you can't afford a therapist, you can still read everything you can find on the subject on the net or in books.\n\nIts to do with correcting errors in your chain of reasoning that leads you to assess situations in the most pesimistic way possible, as if you were seeing the world not as it is, but through a permanent 'gloom filter'. Often we react emotionally not to the real 100% true situation, but to what we think is true or to the meaning we attach to events (because of unhappy memories or fears) instead of the true situation.\n\nFor example, you might get tearful if you thought something someone did meant that they didn't care about you or love you any more, such as forgetting a wedding anniversary. Your reaction is to what you think it means. If you actually ask the person what was meant, you may find they didn't mean that at all, they still love you but just forgot the anniversary. Check your facts before getting upset and do it as soon as possible, don't get depressed for days then find out later you misread the situation.\n\nYour emotional reaction isn't completely irrational. It would be rational if the real situation was that the person didn't love you. Its just that this isn't the real case. The reaility is that the other person just forgot the date. You were reacting to the meaning you attached to the forgotten anniversary (withdrawal of love), not to the real situation or meaning which the other person could have explained (a forgotten date).\n\nSimilarly you may get depressed because you attach the meaning 'I am useless' to being unemployed, when all it really means is 'I don't have a job at the moment, but I might get another one later'. Cognitive therapy can show you how to fix this false reasoning for yourself whenever it occurs. A lot of the work is done by writing down your chain of reasoning on paper, identifying any false reasoning or conclusions and replacing them with more realistic conclusions.\n\nA mis-read situation can be something as simple as someone walking by without saying hi, making you"

Alas, with health care in our country ... we don't have socialized medicine where the care is dispensed only by need. If you are asking people to give you a rather complicated and expensive procedure, prepare to put on your work gloves and work for it. \n\nThe thing you have to do is look at the resources in front of you and try to figure your moves out. Somehow, you found out you needed knee replacement surgery ... could that medical practitioner work through their resources?  See what Kent County's Health Department and the State says. Find out which of the local hospitals is considered the 'teaching hospital' and try to talk to a social worker or intake counselor there. Look up where the medical schools are in our state and try to work with them as well. Use this tool called a computer and find out everything you can - become a student of this.\n\nAnd most importantly, have a good reason why. Don't tear up and talk about your hardships. We all need help in one way or another.

and how do we know it exists?
As I understand it, it's really just a model; the universe appears to be expanding, and the rate of expansion (gained from seeing the apparent change in light frequency reflected from receding planets and stars etc) does not match up with the amount of mass we can ""see"" - a figure presumably arrived at by knowing the approximate amount of stuff in a given space in the sky, then extrapolating that to include the rest of the universe. There isn't enough matter that we can see to account for the universe expansion rate, therefore there must be stuff we can't sense with current equipment i.e. dark matter. \n\nPut simply, dark matter may be matter that emits no electromagnetic radiation...... or it may be that the current description of the universe is very slightly flawed and there is no dark matter at all!"

In order to understand the answer to this better, you have to realize there are two types of diabetes.  \n\nType 1 diabetes is where the body creates no insulin.  Insulin must be taken through injections.  Type 1 is usually, but not always, caused by the body's immune system attacking the Islets of Langerhans, where insulin is made.  This is called an autoimmune disease.\n\nType 2 diabetes is being found to have a strong genetic link, but risk factors for it include being overweight and sedentary.  It occurs when the body becomes resistant to the insulin it makes, causing it to not lower the blood sugar as much as it should."

"is a pole reversal happening right now?explain.?

Yes, it is likely that we are experiencing a reversal at this time. \n\nThe earth's magnetic field has been decreasing in field strength by about 5% per century in recent times. This is one of the fastest decreases of the magnetic field that has ever been verified. Around 700 AD the earth's magnetic field was about 50% higher than it is now. At this rate, it is estimated that the earth could reach a zero-strength magnetic field in about 2000 years. Magnetic reversals are usually triggered when the field strength approaches zero.  Another indication that some geologists and geophysicists believe may be pointing to a reversal is that the poles have been wandering at a faster rate than is commonly seen in the rock record. This instability of the magnetic field suggests we may be close to a reversal. \n\nAlso consider that since we have never experienced a reversal this is hardly a certainty. The earth's magnetic field fluctuates quite widely during what are known as 'excursions', and these are as frequent as every 50,000 years. Our current changes in the magnetic field may result in nothing more than an excursion, which is not a reversal of the field. There have been at least 11 of these excursions since the last reversal at 730,000 years before present. \n\nI've done magnetostratigraphic work."

"How can I deal with a 5 yrd old with a behavior problem?
My daughter is a good girl when I am not around, sure what child isnt.  Anyway, she has a bad case of taking things from kids, hitting, biting, scratching.  She doesnt listen to her teacher at school.  She does what she wants to do and not listen to adults of authority.  She has seen her father physical, mentally,abuse me in front of her.  What can I do to let her know that this behavior isnt what God likes and I dont like either.
In the bible it says to not ""drive the rod of correction"" away from the child, Now, if you think about it in the exact context, most people would think that meant to spank them. I disagree, I believe that if she has seen that kind of behavior, it wouldn't be a good idea to tell her Not to do that, by doing it. Most likely, give her a system. Reward her for being good, Take something away that she likes if she's being bad... when I was younger my mom and I came up with a sticker game. For each good behavior, I recieved a sticker, after 10 stickers I would get something.. a treat. For each bad behavior, I would get a red sticker on my chart, which was a negative. Time outs can be helpful, if she is being loud, talk quietly, almost whisper, it will take patience, but it will work. I will pray that things work out with her. Give her attention, find a story book that promotes good moral and read it to her before she goes to bed at night. tell her you love her, and find some friends that are good influences for her to play with. And most of all, don't bend on time outs, or confiscation of items, or she will think it's okay, the younger years are the years where they learn morals, what's right, what's wrong. Choose wisely, and use your intuition as a mother. -- take care, I hope this helped."

"define the euro-centric and asian-centric perspective on asia?
asia, how did it come to be? the origin of the word not the land mass
For starters, and this is an incomplete answer, but the Eurocentric perspective does not see Europe as a western peninsula of Asia, but actually as its own continent.  Europe is it's own continent according to the Eurocentric perspective.  \n\nBasing its world-view on Platonic essentialism, there is something ""European"" about Europe and its peoples, animals, climate, etc, so that there must be something ""Asian"" about Asia's people, animals, climate, etc.\n\nActually, it's all pretty much the same.  Europeans are really Asians, but at around 1450, they were the most backwards region of the planet--they were the furthest from the great Asian empires of the time.  So they had to rally around their religion, Christianity, and become ""superior"" by virtue of their belief in Christ.\n\nLater, they believed themselves superior because of their race, intellect, rationality, peaceful nature--all the stuff that makes them see themselves as the pinnacle of humanity.\n\nAsians see Europeans as pink, hairy barbarians.  OK, maybe I'm overgeneralizing a bit, but Asians see themselves as a more ancient people, and not really ""asians"" at all.  There are Chinese, Koreans, Thai, Indians, Sikh, Japanese, Khmer, Pilipino (no ""h""), Samoan, etc., each with a vast (if untold) history.  Each radically different from each other as German is to French, but still having religious and cultural roots.\n\nSo, where did the term come from?  From Europeans, of course.\nIn the Platonic world view, rocks are rocks because of their ""rockness.""  In the Socratic worldview, rocks are rocks because of their relationship to papers and scissors, for example, because of their connections to other things.\n\nNot all rocks are the same or course.  Diamonds are much more expensive compared to ordinary pebbles, but not because of their ""diamondness,"" (the Platonic/essentialist view) but rather because it's related to market demand, war in the Congo, sellers and resellers each trying to make a buck, TV commercials, weddings and so on (the Socratic-Hegelian/dialectical worldview).\n\nSo it goes that Asians are Asians, but this really doesn't make us understand Asians, but makes an easy definition to ""Europeans"" and around 1450 and the coming rise of Europe, the Europeans needed to figure things out the quick and easy way.  They were going from bottom of the barrel in civilization, to masters of the universe, for good and bad.\n\nSo if you see the world from an essentialist perspective, then Europe (or Asia) is the center of the world, and everything else revolves around it.  If you see the world from the dialectical perspective, then you see the world as related to each other.  Europe would not be Europe without Asia, and vice-versa.  Each needs the other, the way diamonds need middlemen to become valuable.\n\nWhen it comes to economic integration, IJapan, India and China, to a certain degree are fostering cooperation over competition, because of the need to compete with Europe over markets and create new markets.  In other words, if India and China do good with each other, Chinese people will buy Indian products rather than European products.  This fosters an Asia-first perspective.\n\nTo read more--a tough but good read, read ""The Myth of Continents"" by Martin W. Lewis and Karen Wigen."
"is it wrong to be a stay-at-home housewife (not mum) with domestic helpers?

its not wrong to be a stay-at-home housewife with domestic helpers if you can afford it and still be comfortable. i used to clean houses for a living and i had 1 that was that way, she had me come in on fridays to do the heavy cleaning, bathrooms, dusting, vacuuming, mopping and sweeping. she would wash the dishes and do her own laundry. i just did the every week cleaning."
"pre op tg needs to experience stomach cramps how can this be done in safety?
someone has said Vitamin B complex and another a salt enema but am not happy about either of these options - B complex has other side effects and too much salt is not healthy.  A safe easy solution to my quest to achieve realism will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance erica xx
The only other thing that I can compare to the monthly period cramp would be intestinal cramps.\n   Try drinking 4-6 ounces of Castor Oil followed  up 2hours later with an enema.\n   The only side effect will be a good cleansing and alot of  good cramping which is comparable to a good dose of menstral cramps unless you are pregnant at which point,if you are and you are ready to deliver. . .get ready for a celebration.\n    DO NOT use this method to induce labor unless advised by your doctor."
"I have another question about an Infected Impacted Wisdom Tooth?
Ya, i have an infected and impacted wisdom tooth on my booth left side. It has made the gum area red, swollen, and bleeds sometimes. That side of the throat is really sore too. I just called back my dentist, and he said the earliest he can get me in is in 18 days, and he doesnt want to give me any antibiotics until AFTER the tooth is removed. Isnt that unsafe, the wait 18 days to remove it if it is infected? Should i be worried that it will spread or something? What can i personally do to help with the infection besides brushing my teeth
Good heavens! get another dentist! The one you have enjoys your pain far too much. the tooth is abscessing...you should be on antibiotics NOW. and an infected, abscessed tooth should NOT be messed with until the infection is done away with!"
"I am 17 and I am looking for a job for the summer.  Where should I apply?
I have had some issues finding a job.  Actually, I have applied to 30 different places since January and none of them even called me back.  I'm not an idiot.  I type 75 wpm, know Microsoft Office like the back of my hand, I have a 3.9 GPA, I can do calculus, and I am definitely perfectly capable of memorizing facts and procedures in a short period of time.  I have no work experience, however, and I live in Metro Detroit where the economy might play a part.  I am also 17, which limits me to some jobs that require the worker be 18 years old.  I haven't applied for ridiculously difficult positions, just basic ones like a job at Subway or Target.   Where should I apply?  (Think national chains if you have to.)  I have run out of ideas.  I am also open to suggestions on how to apply, if there is a better way.
Yes it can be hard to find a job at your age expicially if you are attractive oddly enough.\nDo not dress sexy at all. That mean your shirt comes up to your neck and your dress is just below your knee.\nA 17 year old girl has a lot of sex appeal and that is all they see.\nYou live in an area that is economically depressed so there is a lot of competition for jobs.\nYou sound like you are very good at listing your good points and abilities.\nYou just CANNOT GIVE UP EVER.\nThis is hard I know but never stop trying. NEVER STOP!\nList yourself with a temporary employment agency.\nThey will put you into a temporary job that may turn into a full time one.\nIt is much easier to get a job with a temporary agency.\nI mean an agency that places temporary employees."
"how do doctors protect their assets from lawsuits?

Or as a corporation. Partnerships and sole proprietorships are the only business organizations that subject owners to personal liability. However, if you organize as a corporation or as a limited liability company, the company and the individual are treated as separate entities. It's cheaper and less confusing to do an LLC.\nNOTE: Be advised, however, that there is  a legal phenomenon called ""piercing the veil"" which means that is someone is using a company (LLC or corporation) to perpetuate a fraud, even though the personal assets of the owner typically would not be able to be taken because of the business form, a court can touch those assets if found guilty of using the business organization to do ""bad stuff""."
"Why can't two women or two men have a child together?
I'm NOT asking your opinion as to whether it would be right or wrong.  This question has nothing to do with any associated ethical or moral issues.  This is a pure science question.\n\nIf scientists and doctors can do in vitro fertilization with an egg and a sperm, why can't they do it with two sperm or two eggs?  Why can't they take the nucleus out of the egg of one woman, and then put it directly into another egg from another woman?  Wouldn't it have the same effect as injecting a sperm into an egg?  What about removing the nucleus from a donor egg, then replacing it with the nucleus of a sperm from one man, and then fertilizing the resulting egg with the sperm of another man?\n\nWould this work?  What factors would make this impossible?  Is it possible and it just hasen't been done yet?  Has it been done yet, and I just haven't heard about it?\n\nI want educated answers please.  Thank you.
I dont know much cuz im just in high school and not pro but heres my understanding:\nLets begin with the possibilities. Two sperm cells cleary would not work cuz of the YY issue and that wouldn't techniquelly be human anymore. However, in the female XX would be human. problem is The egg cell has a jelly coat whihc protects it. The one sperm cell that fertilizes uses enzymes to digest it away and the sperm cell must bind to a receptor site. Since we know very little about the protein world and how these receptors exactly work, just like we dont know how EXactly carrier proteins work in plasma membranes, its difficult to figure how to do it. Since implanting and fusing the two nuclei of the eggs would not initiate these receptor cyets, the zygote may not necessarly divide. It would just be a mutated egg like before and a sitting duck. You wouldn't get mitosis since it still techniquelly thinks its a gamete and wouldn't replicate. Also, too my understanding, the egg and sperm nuclei are drastically different in size and also chemical makeup may vary.Thats my assesment of the situation. Again, I'm not an expert but i think that might be enough to answer the question."

"Meaning of this expression?
""Sticks and stones might break my bones but your words will never hurt me""\n\n\nSomeone explain briefly what does this expression mean and when it is used please.
Our moms used to tell us to say this when people where being mean to us.  Sticks and stones thrown at us will break my bones and hurt me, but supposedly if we ignore their words, they won't hurt us.  The reality is that words do hurt and will last a lifetime.  Now parents teach children to use their words for helping and praising and not for hurling insults and hate filled remarks."

Tell her how you feel and what you want. If she feels the same, great. If she doesn't, though it may hurt, move on. It is not worth it to hold on for weeks, months, years for something that isn't going to happen. You may end up missing out on the real good stuff by standing in as your best friend's back up boy.\n\nYou said it yourself, she is your best friend. That may be all she will ever be."
"What do confidence intervals represent?

When you compute a mean from a sample, you are estimating the mean of the population from which you sampled.  The population mean is sometimes refered to as the true mean and the mean you compute from your sample is called the sample mean.\n\nWith repeated sampling, you'll come up with a different sample mean each time.  This distribution of sample means is refered to as the sample distribution and it is approximately Normal in distribution.\n\nWhen you compute the standard error using the standard deviation and the sample size, you are estimating the variability in the sample mean.\n\nWhen you estimate confidence intervals, you are estimating the range of possible values where the population may lie relative to your sample mean.\n\nFor instance, your sample mean plus or minus 1.96 standard errors represents an estimate of the 95% confidence interval or range that may contain the population mean relative to your sample mean.  There is a 5% chance that the population mean is actually higher or lower than this range.\n\nLet's say you toss a coin twenty times and measure 9 heads and 11 tails.  The average number of coin tosses at 0.45 heads (which implies 0.55 tails).  The standard error estimate is 0.055343. Multipling the standard error estimate by 1.96 and adding and subtracting the result from the mean yields our 95% confidence interval. There is a 95% chance that the population mean for this process is between 0.341528 and 0.558472."
"Question about biceps - for those you have tried different routines and have had success...?
Just wondering if anyone has had success with any particular routine for relatively fast results with bigger biceps and shoulders.  Reps/ sets/ weight ....and a little on immediate pre and post workout diet. \n\nI want to know what WORKED FOR YOU
When I was having trouble with my bicep development I used drop sets and supersets. \n\nSuperset\nStanding Bicep Curls  3 x 6-10\nHammer Curls          3 x 10-15(with a very light weight)\n\nFollowed this by doing one drop set:\n\nDrop Set\n\nYou perform a drop set by take a standard barbell and loading it with small five pound weights. Find a weight you can perform 10-12 reps with. Then perform standing barbell curls to taking off a 5lbs weight from each side of the barbell every time you reach failure. Continue this pattern until you are lifting only the bar.\n\nTake a little creatine and whey protein and your arms will get huge. Mine are 18inches."
"How do the transformers change AC to DC currents?

AC (alternating current) can be transformed into a DC (direct current) by means of a rectifier or bridge rectifier circuit depending on the AC circuit.\n\nA single AC line to ground or common an be rectified by the use of a single diode. This is a crude dc circuit.\n\nUsing a dual AC line, not grounded, where there are two lines, both above ground, then a full wave bridge rectifier can be used. Four diodes are used which rectify both the positive half as well as the negative half of the AC waveform.\n\nThen there is the 3phase rectifier bridge which uses 6 diodes, converting 3 AC lines, they are 120^deg outof phase of each other. Most industrial machines are using 3 phase power.\n\nMachines using this 3 phase power usually have a Motor Control Center which house a AC Drive (AC to DC to AC) inverter. This drive uses devices called IGBT which are active diode devices providing controlled amounts of power at variable frequency to run a machine.\n\nTo smooth out the DC waveform a capacitor bank is attached to the output of the DC bridge rectifier. \n\nAs you drive by an industrial park you will notice three power lines usually connected to each building. This is the 3 phase power. \n\nLarge Hybrid electric vehicles use such machines."
"How does the sky gets its blue color?

The scientific answer is very long which involves dipole scattering, charged particles vector potential and much more.  There is a simple answer though.  Think of how prism works.  When a light hits the prism, what happens?  The answer is the prism breaks the white light into visible color, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet (these are the rainbow color).  Our atmosphere is filled with dust particles.  So when sun ray hits the particles in the atmosphere, it breaks the white light like the prism.  The color blue has the strongest wavelength out the rainbow colors.  Therefore, it effects more than the red and green wavelength, causing the surrounding air to appear blue.  But during the sunset, the sun light passes farther through the atmosphere causing them to deflect and decrease the blue color. So sunset appear to be red."

"Hom much is too much sitting before computer??
I find head-aches, watery eyes etc. Is that normal? At office one must stare at the PC even if there is no work. Then I browse the net and participate in stupid chatter like this one. So what is considered good and bad 'in-fornt-of-pc-time' ??
Imagine this: stretch out your arm in front of you, palm face up. Have an apple or orange in your palm and hold that position for 5 minutes. What will happen?\n\nThe muscles in your arm will start to sore and the apple/orange will start to feel heavier and heavier, right?\n\nSame thing will happen to the muscles in your neck, shoulder, arm and eyeballs.\n\nSitting in front of your PC, you eyes are focused to the same distance (to the monitor) for a long time. The muscles in the eyeball contracts and stayed in that position for a long time... This will cause discomfort to the eyes. In the long run, it will create vision problems.\n\nSame applies to the muscles in your neck, back, arms etc. The consequence of sitting in front of the computer without moving for a long time could be quite disasterous. The symptoms may not be apparent because they ""grow"" slowly. It takes months or years before you realize you need medical help.\n\nIn order to prevent this, it is good to get away from the PC after 2 hours in front of it. Do some simple exercise. Look at objects far away from you etc. It will do you good.\n\nPrevention is better than cure.\n\nTake care"
"Is there one class of viruses cause aseptic meningitis? Is it only arboviruses?

Aseptic meningitis refers to a clinical syndrome consistent with meningeal inflammation, but with negative cultures for bacterial cause. Symptoms include fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and light sensitivity. The cause is not necessarily viral - it may be secondary to fungus, medication side effect, or malignancy to name a few. Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Other viral causes of meningitis include HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus, Mumps (paramyxovirus), West Nile Virus, Varicella Zoster (Shingles virus), Epstein Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus, and adenoviruses (common cold viruses)."
"Does the Bible speak to all for all time, or those of its time?
See, the Bible talks about being kosher and not eating pork and stuff like that, but when I ask why we ignore it (I'm Catholic), I'm told it was just meant for people before refrigeration.\n\nIs it possible that likewise SOME of Jesus' words were only relevant to those to whom he was speaking. . .at the time he was speaking them?
Well...I would say some of the things Jesus said were only relavant to the time. Since you are Catholic, and I am as well we can probably relate with some of this better. So here it goes:\n\nObviously some of the things that Christ talked about (such as the references to the types of clothing and locations in the world etc...) are general and relevant only to those of the time. I don't know many people who walk around wearing cloaks anymore and we don't execute people by crusifixion anymore so...some of those things are irrelevant, but are important for us to understand.\n\nThe whole thing about not eating pork could be taken a few ways. I don't know if that was because of refigeration...I doubt it, but it could be. Catholic's do not do it because we don't think it's needed. Food is food is food. To have something kosher just means that it must meet certain dietary laws. Jewish followers, as far as I know, are the only individuals who follow that law. It could be for refrigeration purposes, but I think it has more to do with how the passages and laws are interpreted than that. Probably something to do with passover or something...I really don't know, might want to ask a Jewish person that one.\n\nIs it possible that some of Jesus' words were only relevant to those he was talking to at the time? Sure! But Jesus came for the world, so his words are for the world! He may have said he gave the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven to Peter, but he didn't give them to me or you. They were for Peter and whoever Peter gave them to later on. So yeah, I'd say that's a fair statement."

"Why don't ANY antidepressants work for me the way they used to?
I have tried nearly every antidepressant there is over the course of 7 years. When I first tried them they did wonders for my depression and anxiety. But the problem was that they all had side effects that were hard to live with. So I went from medication to medication with the hope of finding one that was effective AND had mild side effects. When I finally realized that no such antidepressant exists, I quit taking them. Then, about 8 months later, I realized that life was unbearable with my anxiety disorders and depression, and so I decided to go back to an antidepressant and just deal with the side effects. But, guess what? When I went back on Paxil (and loaded it in my system for 6 weeks) the effects were not even close to before! And this has happened with ALL antidepressants I've tried since!!! What happened? I can understand becoming immune or resistant to one medication, or even one whole class of medications (e.g., SSRI's), but ALL antidepressants? How can this be possible?!!
I can't tell you why you are immune to all anti-depressants, but you do develop a tolerance for them after awhile and need to change the dosage or the medication itself.  I used to use prozac and it worked great, then I tried it again a few years later and it didn't work for long, I tried something else for a year or so and then it stopped being effective and so on.  I have to change to different types of medications.  At one point after a year on one type, I felt suicidal for whatever reason.  Everything seemed to overwhelm me and I was put of effexor.  That has been working for about 18 months now.  Hopefully it will last for awhile longer.  Sorry about your problems, I hope you find something that will help."

"How could you overcome the feeling of envy over your best friend's popularity?
I have this friend who I have known him for 6 years, and we are really close pals, but the main problem is that he is strangely popular amongst everyone (friends and strangers) just coz he is fat, and I envy him coz I usually get ignored by people when he's around, especially if I introduce him to my new friends, then they suddenly have more interest on him than me, which really pisses me off! How can I make this seem positive to me? I need help coz this is haunting me for over 3 years!
Hmmm... well first of all think about why you like him? could that be the reason other people like him too? \nMaybe it has nothing to do with him being fat, normally and sadly to say, being fat is a disadvantage to people, but perhaps because he is fat people don't see him as a threat.\ninstead of feeling pissed off about it you should realise you must have really good taste in friends if everyone likes him. It would be worse to have a friend that no one wanted around. \nAlso when people meet someone new for the first time,they tend to make more of an effort to make the person feel welcomed into the group and that is why they will talk to him more as they already know you . \nPerhaps he is funny and kind and is interested in other people and not just himself. Also if you are getting pissed off this will manifest itself and you might come across as cold or moody and that doesn't attract people. \nJust try and relax about it, be happy to have this person as a friend and try to focus on the good things about him and not just this one thing,\n \nIn life, if we have a belief about something we tend to look for confirmation of our beliefs...you believe your friends ignore you when your other friend is around so you constantly look for confirmation and signs to reaffirm what you believe....you will find it. If you change what confirmation you are looking for ( such as, my friends are really comfortable with me and like me) you will find that also...focus on the positive not the negative...it is getting you no where.\nhope this helps but you have to work at it.\n\nps: if you do as WELZENN suggested and make fun of him it will make you look dislikable and jealous and he doesn't deserve to be made fun of. that is not the way to treat a friend."

"help with exothermic process question?
The dissolution of barium hydroxide in water is an exothermic process. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The enthalpy of solid barium hydroxide plus pure water is less then that of the solution, at the same temp.\n\nB. the enthalpy of solid barium hydroxide plus pure water is greater than that of the solution, at the smae temp.\n\nC. The enthalpy of soild barium hydroxide plus pure water is the same as that of the soultion, at the same temp.\n\nD. The temp of the solution os lower than of the barium hydroxide and water before mixing.\n\nE. When barium hydroxide dissolves in water, the system does not work on the surroundings. \n\nI am confused please help~
The answer is B.  The enthalpy ( heat content ) of the barium hydroxide and water is more than the enthalpy of the solution.  The reason is because heat is lost in the exothermic reaction\nTrust me I did a chemistry degree!\n\nGuy below me has the right idea, but has used the wrong equation hence the answer is B and NOT A\n\nEnthalpy is a measure of energy content really.  How can the final solution have more energy content if heat has been lost during the reaction?\n\nThe equation below is wrong it should be:\n\nEnthalpy products - Enthalpy reactants = delta H\n\nSee 3rd line of http://www.ausetute.com.au/enthchan.html \n\nThis is why the guy below has the opposite answer.\n\n\nThe simple way of looking at it is \n\nReactants have energy, they lose some during the reaction, this means the products will have even less energy content hence B!!"
"family counseling?
My mother and I are not getting along at all, and we have been considering going into family counseling for a while now.  However, I am kind of apprehensive about it because I worry that as soon as I say anything about how I feel, she going to tell me thats stupid or irrational, because thats what she normally does.  I am also worried that my younger brother will get put in a place where he has to choose sides between us, or that I won't be taken seriously because I am the child, not the parent, and because my mother has so far been blaming me for everything that has not been working in our relationtionship.  I know I'm part of the problem, but I don't think its fair for her to say I'm the entire problem.  I was wondering if anyone who had experience with family counseling would know how any of these issues might be handled?  Also, we would be doing a brief model of family counseling, has anyone experienced any success with this?
I am training as a child and family psychologist, and have provided supervised therapy for a number of families. I believe your worries are normal. If the therapist is worth anything, they will not take sides. A family therapist is trained to see things as a system failure, not an individual failure. Every family is different, and every relationship within that family is different, and therefore people need to adjust themselves for who they are dealing with. In other words, if a parent acts one way to one child, and it is great for that child, it does not mean that same interaction would be good for another child. (Hope that makes sense). \nThe therapist should also be able to diffuse your mothers blame on you, and should be able to keep your brother out of the middle. Again, the basic tenant of family therapy is that it is a system problem, not an individals. Further, when it is your turn to talk the therapist should make your mother respect that, just as she should make you listen to your mother. \nIt is good to admit that you are part of the problem though, but again don't blame, just look to how to change. Blame won't help. Fault doesn't help. Solutions do. If you are willing to change though, your mother will have to follow suit, at least according to systems theory. So be willing to take the first step, even if the rest of your family isn't ready. Even being nicer will force them to change how they interact with you.\nGo to therapy, it helps!!!!!"

"Im16 yrs old,i have mandibular prognathism, id like to know the price for surgery and at what age i can takeit

A friend of mine in high shool had something similar but he was older - about 23-25 when he had surgery. You may have to wait a few years until you have stopped growing to have that surgery or it may be correctible while you are still growing. My advice is to call around to orthodontists about treatment - he/she could refer you to a maxilofacial surgeon. Good Luck!"
"From LA Calif.  I want to kick out a person who is living in my apt. and is smoking in bed. Possible .?
He agreed to paint my house for rent and smoke outside.  He also got a dog when I said no. I have a child with asthma so I told him he could smoke outside only because the heat and air are common to my house and the apartment.
Since you call it an apartment he has become a tenant and you will have to follow legal eviction procedures to get him out.  Any of the self-help solutions others have suggested will just get you and your homeowners policy sued.  (Think what the rates will be if they have you listed as single family home and in fact you have an apartment and a tenant!)  Also I don't know your building codes but I will bet your apartment is illegal and not built with permits, because you said you have one hvac unit for both residences.  You opened a can of worms when you rented this out.  (For whatever the rent was supposed to be) and he will have access to legal aid in Los Angeles for sure.  Good luck be more careful in future to follow the law."

You just did. I was thinking I was right when answering this question. After further review and reading more deeply into it I can see where I was wrong. I apologize deeply for being wrong and adamantly deny it was for the right reasons, as it is obvious it was for the wrong reasons only.\nSomewhere in my thought process I made a wrong turn on that long highway leading the right way. Your need to prove me wrong is right, and rightfully I appreciate you showing me how wrong I was. Thanks again, and have a good evening. Wrong or right consider me a friend."
"ANA test (homogeneous and Speckled?)?
My daugther 9 yr old ANA positive  1:40 homogeneous(2nd test)\nANA positive 1:40 Speckled (1st test) what is the difference?
A positive ANA is one of the indicators of autoimmne disease. I have lupus and lots of us have a positive ANA, but not all of us. The ANA can vary from test to test. Other conditions can cause a positive result. There are times when there will be a negative result but disease is still present. \n\nAn antinuclear antibody test in itself does not result in a diagnosis. An experience doctor, most likely a rheumatologist, is your best bet."
"who thinks the 80's were the best era?
why or why not?
When you look at the music created between early 1980-1987, there was a genre of musical talent I believe the world will never see again. \nWhere has this talent gone?\n\nThe 90's music was what you listened to when your 5 seconds short of suicide, and the 70's music was simply 1-dimension heavy rock(for the most part)\n\n60's music was fast-beat 3 minute songs designed for AM radio\n\nAnd the 'music' today? Horrific...to say the least.\n\nThe 80's were a great era."

"i need a real serious medical professional opinion about this so here goes....?
My Depo Pravera (i think thats how you spell it) shot recently came to an end. I'm not in the states and i'm not able to get another shoot. But my question is after intercourse with my boyfriend I have been spotting. I thought that my cycle started but I was only spotting for one day and this has occured 3 times. Is it because I'm no longer on the shoot. Or could it be because he is really big in size and length that he is actually causing the bleeding by penetration. However before I started this Depo Shot in January he never caused the bleeding. Someone please tell me what they think. ONLY SERIOUS RESPONSES AND NOT DISREPECTFUL DISGUSTING ONES. THANK YOU.
your body will produce irregular spotting for a while. You should take a pregnancy test just to be safe and if it comes up negative then yes, it is b/c your body is just reacting to coming off of the birth control and your periods will be irregular for a few months. Also FYI, I am 23 and I have used Depo Prevara and my doctor strongly urged me not to take it anymore b/c it has been proven to be very bad for your bones. My doc says don't take it for more than 2 yrs. otherwise it could cause major damage. Just ask your doc about it."
"What's your best excuse for your cuts?
If someone sees your cuts, what do you say? Like, my current cover story (which is kind of lame) is that I was sitting in chem and I broke some glass (this part is true), and then I got curious to see if the glass would cut me, and then omg it did!  But that is really lame.  So I was wondering what your stories were?
The fact that you need to cut yourself is scary, go seek medical help, counselling, medication etc. Or find a new hobby."
"AlbertEinstein“Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future
It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.”\n\nhttp://en.thinkexist.com/search/searchquotation.asp?search=buddhism&q=author%3A%22Albert+Einstein%22\n\nDo you agree or disagree with his statement?

"What Secrets Have Been Revealed By Observing The Universe In The Radio and The X Ray Spectrum?

Wow, getting your science from coast to coast.  That's pathetic.\n\nObserving in the radio portion of the spectrum has revealed massive H2 clouds in other galaxies, which are needed for star formation.  They can only be observed in the 21cm radio line.  We've also realized that many 'radio' galaxies have immense lobes extending out from the galaxy, many times the size of the galaxies, made up of gas expelled from an interior black hole.  X-rays have shown us extrememly hot gas from galaxies and galactic clusters, falling into black holes."
"how to avoid my being mad  to everyone sometimes?

count to 10. while you're counting, using a very calm, rational voice inside your head, ask yourself, ""In 6 months, will this still be an issue?

"What was the purpose of the Old Testament Law?
The Law was so strict and cumbersome.  Why not something else?  Why did God do it that way?
Simple:\nThe Law was created for man to show what sin was, the effects and consequences, and to prove that man could not live on his own without dependence of God.\nYes, some of the laws, to us, seemed outrageous.  Yet, Jesus proved it was possible to live the Law.  Through His sacrifice at Calvary, the payment for sin was paid in full.  All we have to do is accept Him as Lord and Savior, Jesus will guide us under grace, and not under the law."

"Are their early stages of dissecting cellutitis and how is it treated?

What causes cellulitis?\n\nStaph (Staphylococcus aureus) is the most common bacteria that causes cellulitis.\n\nStrep (Group A Streptococcus) is next most common bacteria that causes cellulitis. A form of rather superficial cellulitis caused by strep is called erysipelas; it is characterized by spreading hot, bright red circumscribed area on the skin with a sharp raised border. The so-called ""flesh-eating bacteria"" are, in fact, also a strain of strep which can in severe cases destroy tissue almost as fast as surgeons can cut it out.\n\nCellulitis can be caused by many other types of bacteria.\n\nIt is crucial for the doctor to distinguish whether or not the inflammation is due to an infection. The history and physical exam can provide clues in this regard, as can sometimes the white blood cell count. A culture for bacteria may also be of value.\n\nWhen it is difficult or impossible to distinguish whether or not the inflammation is due to an infection, doctors sometimes treat with antibiotics just to be sure. If the condition does not respond, it may need to be addressed by different methods dealing with types of inflammation that are not infected. For example, if the inflammation is thought to be due to an autoimmune disorder, treatment may be with a corticosteroid.\n\nAntibiotics, such as derivatives of penicillin or other types of antibiotics that are effective against the staph germ, are used to treat cellulitis. If other bacteria, as determined by culture tests, turn out to be the cause, or if patients are allergic to penicillin, other appropriate antibiotics can be substituted."
"What am I exactly?
What religious group would I be in? I believe in God, and I believe he created the world, but I have a hard time believing most of the stuff that's written in the Bible. (And I should know alot about it. My father's a retired Baptist preacher).
I am in the same situation, you need to find the proper guide in your seeking. I attended many different churchs and listened to their versions. I look at the old testement as more of a history book and the new testement as a guide book. Expand your reading in and about the bible and you will find that most organized religions SLANT and hang on certain parts to forward their doctrine. So you need to find your own truths and hopefully you will find Christ as your Savior."

"mohomed and moses?
one day mohomed and moses went to watch a camel race, and mohomed sat behind moses. when the camels got going moses kept on swinging his head from side to side and this made mohomed angry because it distracted him. so mohomed told moses to stop doing it, and moses refused saying , ' brother mohomed, i am a man of the desert and as a percaution i always swing my head from side to side in order to look for any danger in the desert. so its my habit and i cant stop it'. \nmohomed got so angry that this is what he told moses' brother moses, been a man of the desert if you cant stop swinging your bloody head, then look at me, i should always be swinging my penis forward and backwards since i have so many bloody women in my harem'\n\nwhat do you think of my joke?

"prove for f?
Let f: G->G be homomorphism such that f(x) doesn't equal to I, where G is a group of prime order with identity I and x belong to G. Prove that f is an isomorphism.
It's not right.\n\nf: G -> G so that f(x)=1 for every x in G is a homomorphism but it\nisn't a homomorphism.\n\nIf f isn't trivial you can prove the statement.\nf homomorphism => f(G) and Kerf are subgroups of G.\nG of prime order implies (according to Lagrange's theorem) that its only subgroups are {1} and G itself. \nIf f isn't trivial Kerf /= G (not equal) so Kerf={1} and f is injective.\nOn the other side f not trivial implies f(G) /= {1} therefore we have\nf(G)=G and f is surjective. So f is a isomorphism.\n\nExcuse me, but my English sucks :-)"

"Should abortion be legalized and be the right for woman or couple to decide? why or why not?

Abortion should not have been legalized back in 1973 or so, because it is murder.  God allows individuals and governments to make mistakes with their free will, so it HAS been legalized. Whether we like it or not, I don't think this law is going to go away. However, whatever else I think of President Bush, I am grateful he has put an end to the abominable practice known as ""partial birth abortion"". I think ANYONE knows THIS is murder.\nI find it amazing that the woman whom our abortion law was named after DID NOT HAVE AN ABORTION. She had her daughter, and both are Christian believers who speak out against abortion. \nHere is what the Word says: If two men are fighting and a ""woman with child"" is injured and loses the baby, the guilty person has committed a crime. (Exodus 21:22) So I ask you-what if people hurt that child ON PURPOSE?\nHere are some beautiful words: ""You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb...You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed. \nHow precious are your thoughts about me, O God! They are innumerable! I can't even count them...And when I wake up in the morning, you are still with me!"" Psalm 139"

Hey Everyone\n\nMy mom is a diabetic and wears a medical alert bracelet. Today she went to a luncheon and saw a woman wearing a really nice one she said she got from Laura's Hope. I was wondering if anyone has heard of this foundation and if so, how can I go about getting one of those medical alert bracelets for my mom. I did find a website earlier for Laura's Hope, but they didn't mention any bracelets so that's why I'm here. \n\nThanks in advance for any help I can get....
I could not find anything about the bracelets on her web site either but there is a contact link.  Why not drop an email and ask about the bracelets.  They might not offer them online because the demand might overwhelm their supply.  It never hurts to ask!"

"After having a tic, how do you know if you got lime disease from it?

Infection usually occurs if the tick was attached for 36-48 hours.  It removed before that, there is far less chance of contracting Lyme Disease.  If you have contracted it, it can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to manifest symptoms.\n\nThe early symptoms are:\ncircular red skin rash\nFatigue or lack of energy (most common symptom) \nHeadache and stiff neck. \nFever and chills. \nMuscle and joint pain. \nSwollen lymph nodes\n\nFor more info:\nhttp://aolsvc.health.webmd.aol.com/hw/arthritis/hw77228.asp?src=AOLConditionWidget"
"How would you calculate the relative atomic mass of lithium - what equation should be used??

To calculate atomic mass of an element, it is just a weighted average of the naturally occuring isotopes.  For example:\n\nIf element A has two isotopes, A-23 and A-24, the masses are 23.5 and 24.5 respectively, and the percentage abundance is 93.0% for A-23 and 7.00% for A-24, you would:\n\nMultiply mass of A-23 (23.5g) to the decimal of the percentage (ie.  93.0%/100 = .930).  You would then do the same thing with A-24, and now you will have two numbers.  The final step, you sum the two numbers you obtained by the previous calculations.\n\nI know this is a general example with a made up element and made up numbers, but it is all that comes to mind when I read your question.  I hope this helps."
"What's the difference between a tube and a pipe?
At what point does a tube/conduit become a pipe, something to do with diameter nominal (DN) ?
Tubing is a structural component, while pipe is meant to carry fluids and gasses.\n\nThe nominal size of pipe is based upon its inner diameter. The inner diameter of schedule 40 pipe is usually very close to the nominal diameter of the pipe. Different schedules will have different wall thicknesses, and different inner diameters.\n\nTubing is a structural material. Its size is measured by its outer diameter."
"Do people turn Gay or they are born Gay?

Well, if people would use common sense, they would realize that being born ""Gay"" isn't logical. Why would a species be born attracted to the same sex? Can they reproduce? \n\nMost species on this earth, are born to reproduce and create others like themselves. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a Male and Female species and a attraction to the opposite sex. This is how every species on this earth is created. \n\nI have heard thousands of people talk about genetic research and how it proves that Gays are born Gay. Genetic research also proved that cloning was possible, and look how that turned out.\n\nI have also heard many people talk about how their cat or dog was seen having sex with another of the same sex. I've also seen a dog eat it's own waste too. Animals can become confused just like humans, although I assume that Humans should have more sense. \n\nSo why do we have Gays and Lesbians? Well, actually it is very simple. Things that happen to a person, wether it's at a very young age or in adulthood, reflect on how that person thinks. Many have been abused in some way or another. Either by being molested as a child, or treated as an outcast when they were young. Many grew up in broken homes and were without one of their biological parents. Many were not taught how someone of their gender should behave. There are many different reasons, and what usually happens is this. Individuals who have not had the so called ""Normal Life"" will seek acceptance from those who are similar to themselves and this is normally the same sex gender, because they easier to relate too. A bond is created and the trust and affection they feel towards each other for accepting one another, becomes Love. This kind of Love is stronger than most people realize, because it fills the void that someone in our society has created. Someone, Sometime, Somewhere has done something to each of these ""Gay"" people and caused their lives to change forever. \n\nThis is where ""Gays"" and ""Lesbians"" came from, and there's nothing we can do to change it. There will always be different types of people, but our society created this one. \n\nA Gay person can chose to live a Straight lifestyle and be happy. A Straight person can also chose to be Gay if they want to and live happy also. How? Because they are both Human Beings with feelings, and feelings can change. If feelings couldn't change, there wouldn't be any such thing as a divorce. \n\nI have also heard the remark many times about why would a person chose to be ""Gay"", since our society hates ""Gays"" and ""Lesbians""? The answer: Many didn't chose to be ""Gay"". Situations in a persons life can alter their feelings towards certain beliefs. For example: Would you chose to be with your abusive biological family or a loving adoptive one? Your instincts tell you to stay with your biological family but your feelings tell you to go to the adoptive one because they won't hurt you and will love you.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long, but it seems that there are so many people out there that don't look outside the box or they refuse to see beyond their way of thinking. Hope this helped you to understand in some way why the world has Gay people."

"The longest unimpeded river in the United States?
Looking for the longest unimpeded river in the United States lock and dams count.
Lengths of the major rivers\nTake a look at a map of the United States or of any country in the world. Notice how towns and cities tend to be located next to rivers? This is no coincidence. Rivers provide water for the essential needs of both tiny towns and huge cities. There's a good chance that you live near one of our nation's large rivers. Ever wonder what rivers are the longest? Look at the graphic below to see our short list of long rivers.\n\n(It's not so easy to define how long a river is.

"vitamin D3?
what is the differance from plain vitamin D? and vitaminD3?
Cholecalciferol is a form of Vitamin D, also called vitamin D3. It is structurally similar to steroids such as testosterone, cholesterol, and cortisol (though vitamin D3 itself is a secosteroid).\n\n1g of pure vitamin D3 is 40 000 000 (40x106) IU, or in other words, one IU is 0.025 μg.\n\n\nVitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble alcohols that contribute to the maintenance of normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. The two major forms of vitamin D are D2 (or ergocalciferol) and D3 or cholecalciferol. Vitamin D is required for the formation of strong bones and teeth. It is manufactured in the skin by the activation of a sterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) by ultraviolet radiation (sunlight). Vitamin D is classified as a vitamin because it is required for metabolism and deficiency can result in disease, including rickets and osteoporosis\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D#Overview"
"how old is the universe?

The age of the universe from the time of the Big Bang, was estimated to be about 13.7 billion (13.7 × 10 to the power of 9) years, with a margin of error of about 1 % (± 200 million years), according to NASA's WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe). However, this is based on the assumption that the underlying model used for data analysis is correct. Other methods of estimating the age of the universe give different ages.\n\nA fundamental aspect of the Big Bang can be seen today in the observation that the farther away from us galaxies are, the faster they move away from us. It can also be seen in the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the much-attenuated radiation that originated soon after the Big Bang. This background radiation is remarkably uniform in all directions, which cosmologists have attempted to explain by an early period of inflationary expansion following the Big Bang."

"Why do you have to go to the doctor if your not sure you have a yeast infection but you cure it.?
I cant afford to go to the doctor but I did notice he tells me all the time that i have a yeast infection. I havent been to the doctor in two years but I have just realized I get a yeast infection right before my menustration. Why does it say on the instructions to not use monistat if your not sure you have it. Could you do any more harm to yourself if you do try and cure yourself. I spend 20.00 dollars a month on this stuff. Thats less then going to my doctor.
I understand what you are going through - I also fight yeast infections constantly and used to get about one a month, right around my period.  My doctor tested me for hyperglycemia and diabetes - increased blood sugar can feed yeast infections (as can any sugar).  I would have your doctor do that for you.\n\nIn my case, I am not diabetic - just yeast infection prone.  Lots of things can trigger them - sex, certain types of condom, too much sugar in my diet, messing up my birth control pills, and more.  I control it by being careful about all those things, and also by 1-2 yogurts a day (make sure it has live active cultures) and taking acidophilus, an OTC vitamin similar to yogurt.  (And the occasional Monistat - I'm down to one about 1 every six months.  Another tip - use the 7 day - it's more of a pain but MUCH more effective and cheaper)\n\nAlso - do you take a lot of antacids?  Stomach acid helps control yeast - and atacids eliminate stomach acid.  I have stomach problems and have to be careful how many antacids I take, or yeast will flare up.\n\nIt is very important you confirm with a doctor that you are suffering from yeast infections, and not another medical problem/STD/etc.\n\nGood luck!"

"So Jews are chosen? What does that mean exactly?

When Adam and Eve sinned, the purpose for God's paradise on earth was put into haitus.   Adam and Eve sinned by deliberately breaking God's law. So Jehovah put them out of the garden of Eden. Paradise was lost. God immediatly told Adam that there would be salvation for the future generations by saying ""And I will put emnisty between you and the women, you will bruise him in the heel but he will bruise you in the head(Genesis 3:1-6, 23) Jehovah has not forgotten his purpose for this earth. He promises to make it into a paradise, where humans will live forever. How will he do this?—Psalm 37:29. Abraham displayed great faith when we was willing to sacrafice his son to God he told him  ""Because of your seed, many nations will be blessed"".  I know this sounds confusing but I will get to my point.  The profecy in Genesis 3:15 meant that Jesus would come to be, a promised seed that would balance out what Adam had done for mankind.  He would be bruised in the heel as Satan tried to kill him and he was literaly dead for three days yet Satan will be bruised in the head when he is finally destroyed after his second comming.  Abraham's promised seed (Jesus) would come from  his lineage.  Of course since they themselves (The chosen nation) disobeyed him and did not have faith in him, God removed his favor from them and delivered it to all the nations and those who displayed true faith in him (Us, all human kind)"
"I need help determining if my new product idea is a realistic one?
I won't go into specifics but it would be a range of products that use GPS technology. I am in the UK.\n\nI am only at the 'idea stage' and therefore I would like to know how I can go about determining if there is already a similar product on the market and how I can find out if my idea (and hopefully the resulting product range) can be protected by a patent or something similar. My worry is that because GPS technology is available to anybody I will not be able to bring the products to market without being blown away by a company with more experience and financial power.
Patent research first, imisidro says - with hardware software this is particularly difficult as there are numerous licensing implications on top of this.\n\nWhatever the idea is, if you're a startup you're better off looking at the component route (e.g. combined with GPS your bit forms an essential part of the solution) that you can license for distribution, rather than a vertical solution that tries to do everything for the customer in one package, which has both patent/license complexity and more likelihood of direct competition."

"Is it rude to use a countries customs for dining, when you are out at a restaurant in a town near you?
I was at an Indian restaurant in town this afternoon at thought about if is was a complimant to belch during the meal in their native land would it be rude for me to show proper apprectation, in belching? Now I did not belch because I don't know if it their custom or not, but now I would like to go back and follow the customary motions for a meal in India. But is it proper to preform the tradtion of a country in a restaurant in another country
It was a good thing you didn't belch that one time in the Indian restaurant.  It would have been very rude.  Even though it was an ethnic restaurant, you are actually still in your home country.  And I am sure there would have been several of your fellow countryfolk who would have been offended had you actually burped.

"my tooth s broken..broke it 7 years back..wanna know the best way to fix it.. front tooth..how much ll it cost
i am from b.lore
Occasionally, there can be a sudden increase in the forces applied to the teeth, as is the case when a person develops a tooth grinding habit or seizure disorder. Assuming that this is not the case, the problem is some kind of structural weakening in the teeth themselves.\nTeeth may be weakened by active decay, or by the placement of large fillings to restore decay. Often the weakening produced by the resulting loss of tooth structure does not manifest immediately. However, over time, chewing forces slowly act on these weak points, creating microfractures that propagate through the tooth until it finally breaks.\nThere are broad guidelines that dentists apply when deciding the proper way to restore a broken or decayed tooth. These guidelines occasionally point the way to an inappropriate treatment, or perhaps the dentist or patient compromise an ""ideal"" treatment plan for reasons of time or financing. In either case, a choice is made where a filling is placed where, in retrospect, a crown or onlay may be proven to have been a better choice of restoration.\nIt is probable that you are now reaping the result of just such past compromises. Perhaps large fillings were placed where a crown would have served you better. No matter; most fractured teeth can be restored by placement of a crown. This will reinforce the remaining tooth structure and protect it against future breakage.\nWe'd advise you to consult with your dentist. In addition to the broken tooth, he may be able to detect other teeth that have a high probability of breaking in the near future. If you dislike surprises, you may want to consider pre-emptively crowning these weakened teeth before they break."
"where is Ushba mountain?

Ushba mountain, Svaneti\n\nUshba is one of the highest Georgian mountains, it is 4710 m. above the sea level. \nUshba is a beautifully steep mountain with twin peaks, draped in snow and glaciers. It has been called the ""Matterhorn of the Caucasus,"" although Ushba is nearly one thousand feet higher than the Matterhorn (14,688 ft.), and is much more massive. Its second peak (15,407 ft,) is located just northeast of the slightly higher main peak. Ushba's high steep faces and icy ridges have captured the interest of mountaineers for over a century. Despite its remoteness, the mountain received much attention around the turn of the twentieth century, and was climbed by all the obvious routes within a twenty year period after its first ascent. Today there are fifty official routes to the summit. None are easy."
"Has anyone else had a bad experience with Tim Clark or Mission Associates Realtor?
I believed that I was duped by this man.  He was my real estate agent when I sold my home.  He had a buyer in escrow for 5 months who was not qualified and then when that fell through and I was about to be in foreclosure, he came up with a buyer that HE represented.  My home was sold at way under market value and quickly ""flipped"".

In yr2004 I read a news item in the newspaper that some students of the middle school in Cape Elizabeth become unconscious by stopping supply to the brain. Health authorities have found that this practice has not affected their memory and intelligence badly so far.I would like to know the details.
I don't know who told you health authorities found the practice safe - IT IS NOT!\n\nHealth Authorities ARE WARNING ITS A DANGEROUS THING TO DO!\nYou run the risk of death or living as a vegetable from brain damage when you screw up.., meaning someone will have to feed you, cloth you, clean you, you cant go and hang out with friends..., you have a non existent life.\n\nDO NOT RISK IT.

I have Laptop, internet connection at home. my job is not enough to earn my bread. want to wrok extra at the ease of home. I am from India, New Delhi. name is Veeraj.
Most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things - getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program (also known as MLM or pyramid plans) OR they have their own business. Your own business is something you create yourself, not find on the internet. You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless ""opportunities"" out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?"
"What should I do with my life?
I'm 26 years old with a highschool education. I'm currently working at a retail store for $6.50 an hour. Unfortunately I don't make much money so i'm living with relatives. I have nothing holding me back from finding a career, moving to a new location, or continuing my education except for money. I'm wanting to start my own business someday far in the future when i'm around 35+ but right now I want to find a better job. What should i do to find a job that can offer me at least 35k a year or more? I'll do anything short of joining the military (except maybe the coast guard and navy). I love art, computers, and technology. Thank you for your input.
I would fill out a FAFSA, you can go on-line to do this, this will allow you financial aide for if you would like to go back to school.  Alot of Degrees require Co-Op job opportunities, so you can go to school and work at a lucrative place involving what your degree is toward!

Your heart is not controlled by sound.  If you hear a particular sound and your brain interprets it in a way that makes you stressed or excited, your heart rate may go up.\n\nAn example of this would be hearing a siren right behind you when you are driving - that will make most people's heart rate increase.\n\nHeart rate is controlled by your sympathetic nervous system."
"waht will it cost to tile a floor  that is 12 feet wide by 20 feet long, if it costs 8.91 per square yard?
explain
You will need to convert the square footage of the room into square yards, then it's easy.\n\n12ft*20ft = 240 sq feet.\n\nNow square feet is really just feet*feet, right?  So set up a row of fractions multiplied together to get your units to cancel the way you want them to.  We're looking for square yards, so start there.  Square yard is yard*yard\n\n1yard/3feet * 1yard/3feet * 240feet*feet --> the feet cancel in the top and bottom and you are left with square yards for the units.  Now to multiply the numbers:  240/(3*3)=26.67 sq yards.\n\nNow using the same method, you can find total price.\n\n$8.91/sq yd * 26.67 sq yd.  The sq yards cancel and you have 8.91*26.67 = $237.63\n\nplus tax :)"

I keep hearing about the risk of blood clots and other stuff but i see no effects on me yet.  is any one else out there satisfied with it?
I was on the patch but I got off of it because of all the hype.  It gives you a lower dose of estrogen throughout the week but actually provides a lot more total estrogen to your body.  I switched to tri-phasil because it mimics your cycle (any triphasic).  Triphasics mean that it has 3 levels of hormones in the pack.  I would try one of these.  I just thought I would be safe.

The reasons are so many. Some western people go there sent from their companies to supervise or to help business relations. There are lot of people interested in Chinese culture or people who have studied Chinese linguistic so they get lot of opportunities to work in China.\nChina becomes very open market and big economy so no wonder this is happening. I've been to China. I found it extremely interesting though quite different from my culture. The hardest thing to fit into was the high humidity climate and the lack of good yogurt, milk and cheese."

"Corporations Law: requirement of a ""quorum"" and proxy voting.?
Assuming that a majority is required to effect a proposal, it would seem that a proposal that was submtted to shareholders (who could then vote by proxy) would stand little chance of being approved if a quorum is required when shareholders don't return their proxies.  Suppose 50% of eligible shareholders return their proxies and all vote to approve the proposal... does the proposal fail?
Unfortunately there is no way to tell based on the information you have provided.  The critical additional information required is:\n - what is the quorum requirement (is it 50% or higher?)\n - do shareholders voting by proxy count towards the quorum amount?\n\nI imagine you were asking this question because you don't know these answers.  I would advise you to seek legal assistance, as the quorum requirements can be set through national or state legislation (and you haven't said which country you are from); but then can be modified by the constitution of the specific company."
"How much is it to rent an office building?
and how much would it be  for supplies?
Depends where you're looking to rent.  In Hong Kong, Central London, Manhattan etc you could rent a square foot for about the same price you could rent an entire office out in the sticks somewhere.  If you don't get a satisfactory answer perhaps add more detail or post another question specifying where the office building would be."
"Is anyone else convinced that snap crackle and pop are gay lovers.?
I mean they've been living in that cereal bowl together for 80 years now, I actualy called the Kellogs Customer helpline to enquire about this matter and they assured me that they are cartoon caracters and therefore have no sexual preferance, they also ensured me that tony the tiger does not have a history of child molestation.  Hmmm.
I'm pretty sure about snap and pop being gay, but I've heard rumours about crackle being into bestiality.  He gets himself hopped up on Fruit Loops and then does freaky things with Toucan Sam."
"Do the goespels contradict eachother?

Yes, there are numerous contradictions. Especially if you try to reconstruct the life of Jesus. The biggest contradictions exist between John on one hand and the three others on the other hand. But even between Luke, Marc and Matthew there are great contradictions.\nSome examples: the final stay in Jerusalem. Did Judas hang himself or did he threw himself out from a cliff? Who attended the crucifiction and who was at the open grave? etc. etc."
"What does St. Patrick really means?

St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, is one of Christianity's most widely known figures. But for all his celebrity, his life remains somewhat of a mystery. Many of the stories traditionally associated with St. Patrick, including the famous account of his banishing all the snakes from Ireland, are false, the products of hundreds of years of exaggerated storytelling.\n\nIt is known that St. Patrick was born in Britain to wealthy parents near the end of the fourth century. He is believed to have died on March 17, around 460 A.D. Although his father was a Christian deacon, it has been suggested that he probably took on the role because of tax incentives and there is no evidence that Patrick came from a particularly religious family. At the age of sixteen, Patrick was taken prisoner by a group of Irish raiders who were attacking his family's estate. They transported him to Ireland where he spent six years in captivity. (There is some dispute over where this captivity took place. Although many believe he was taken to live in Mount Slemish in County Antrim, it is more likely that he was held in County Mayo near Killala.) During this time, he worked as a shepherd, outdoors and away from people. Lonely and afraid, he turned to his religion for solace, becoming a devout Christian. (It is also believed that Patrick first began to dream of converting the Irish people to Christianity during his captivity.)\n\nSt. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17, his religious feast day and the anniversary of his death in the fifth century. The Irish have observed this day as a religious holiday for thousands of years."
"Is it nessary to have a lawyer to deal w/the state of texas concerning work enjury?
It appears the insurance company handling my accident was picked by the company I work for, and my case has been rocketed through the system and is not getting me medical attention, just phy therpy, no doctor for back spine problems.
You need a lawyer. Once you get a lawyer, you will be amazed at how much faster things will move. The trick is finding a good one. Many lawyers if not all will take an injury case on a contingency basis. Check with the local bar association."
"Can anyone tell me if being a mystery shopper is worth it?
I'm thinking of being a mystery shopper but before I start applying I want to know if it's worth it at the end of the year. Also for now I can only do nights and weekends. Will I even be able to get any jobs?
Absolutely!  I just spent the night at a hotel last weekend and had to order $50 room service!  I'm reimbursed for the hotel stay and room service all for completing a survey on the internet.  I've also done restaurant shops, bowling, got a free oil change, and more.  One of my favourite companies in Canada is Shoppers Confidential.  It costs nothing to join, you just need to pass a short quiz.  Hope this helps!"
"in ancient times what does the pentacle protect against?

the 5 points of the pentacle stand for the 5 elements - earth, air, fire, water and spirit. the spirit always points up, it is the most important. the circle around them is to protect them from evil.\n\nthere is nothing evil about the pentacle, as christians and muslims conquered the world they attempted to remove symbols of old religion, they did so by telling people that those symbols were those of evil. this occured not only to the pentacle but also the ankh of isis and many other symbols.\n\nThey cannot stand for the devil in ancient times, since the devil was first mentioned in the bible, and the bible did not exist in ancient times.  Recent people who has become anti-christian and claim to worship the devil have twisted and perverted the symbol and turned it upside down and claimed it as thier own."

59yr old woman who has tried ""everying""
YES!!!! I'm 49 and it started when I was 39. I tried Hormone Replacment therapy but, the side effects from the hormones was more than I could handle. I have found that my weight has alot to do with the severity of the hot flashes. .... I'm 5' 7"" and now weigh about 200lbs. (Yuck, not something I like to share) but a couple of years ago, I excersized & ate healthy (mostly vegetarian meals) and got down to 145 lbs. at which point, my symptoms dissapeared completely. (AND I looked great) My hubby likes to feed me, so I gained it back but am now losing it again (I finally made him realize that the extra weight was making me miserable - he remembers that the hot flashes and mood swings dissappeared when I lost the weight before) and with every few pounds I lose, the symptoms lessen. Hope this helps :)\nAlso, I do take an over the counter med called: Black Cohosh Menopause complex. It's made by Spring Valley and I get it at WalMart for about 10 bucks for 30 day supply. It helps a little. I do sleep better when I take this."
"How do you reduce fat and improve form in your chest?
How is this done? And what is best for stomach aswell?
Calculate how many fat grams a day it takes to maintain   your weight find out from your doctor or dietition. Pick up a booklet telling calories and fat grams of foods at the supermarket. Look up and write down fat grams of everything you eat, once you find out how many fat grams you will let yourself take in a day. Keep that number under the number allowed for the day. Get on the scale every morning, and write it on your calendar. This gives you control of your weight. Everything you take in takes a small decision. Make that decision right in the store before you buy things."

"Why do Christians choose Christianity over the plethora of other religions out there?
I find it fascinating that Christians should choose their particular religion while there are other religions that logically are far more credible.\nLook at kabbalah or Judaism,christianity is only alive and well because political motivations have given it rise.Why would you surmise that Jesus is god when the Q'RAN says otherwise.\nYou christians are a feisty lot that breeds intolerance into the very depths of humanity.I look forward to the day when Christianity is abolished and people shine with glee over science.\nPlease submit to me my required respect as I have only showed you your do respect.Don't be a hypocrite!\nYour bible cleary says you must turn the other cheek from your non-believers.
The thing is that people (not just Christians) DON'T CHOOSE. Religion is many times given to people as we grow up. I was a Christian once, and noticed how my mother passed on her religion unto me, telling me to pray, go to church and so on. There was no time for a ""choosing of religion"" for me and I imagine that is so for many people. Parents give their religion to children, it's a bonding and cultural thing. And a good thing because religion satifies a psychological need for in-group membership, and spiritual welbeing.\n Strange thing is that I CHOSE my religion and chose Judaism as my path.\nI support religions...let people believe what they want."

"Do you send wedding invitations to attendant's families?
I want to invite my attendant's families, but am not sure if simply sending an invitation to the attendant is satifactory - is it okay to assume that they realize that their families are invited, or do I have to send the family members an invitation as well.
Wedding ettiquette dictates that you should send seperate invitations to the attendants families because it is considered rude to simply ""pass on"" the invite by word of mouth via an attendant who, due to invariably being a close friend, will be asked personally and actually not receive a written invite."
"Riddle me this...?
If (since) God created Adam perfectly, and Adam communed with God for the longest, why then did Adam choose to sin, and if you answer ""because he chose to disobey according to his free will"", why then did God punished Adam for exercising His free will?  No ""answers"" from non-believers.
According to the bible, God specifically told Adam not to partake of the ""forbidden fruit"" (I am summarizing, not quoting), Adam disobeyed a direct order, and was ejected.  Free will is not a free pass to just freak out and do whatever the hell you want.  Free will cannot be used as a cop out.  God wants us to think for ourselves, (why, I have no idea), and to make the right decisions, to be good for goodness sake, basically.  That is what I think, I do not really expect anyone to agree with me, it makes too much sense.\n\n\nI am a Christian, it is not my place to judge others, I am just trying to be a good person.\n\n\nGod Bless You"
"Can my mom get infected when washing my underwear?

Or maybe my brothers? Because she puts all the clothes in the washing machine but I don't know If this could infect them. Help me please, Thanks a lot!
No - the virus would die when exposed to the air.  If that didn't work, the washing machine would also kill the virus.  Finally, if that didn't work - then the dryer would kill it.  Don't worry.\n\nHPV is transmitted by direct contact with the warts or infected area."

"Can people say anything nice about black women?
For once can we say something nice, we overlook the beauty and talent in black women. They have already heard too demanding and bossy, which is a stereotype. If you have anything nice to say, please respond.
I actually just read an article written by a black woman about how she was tired of men assuming she was just some big-lipped, big-butt sex object.  Whenever guys payed her compliments (especially white males) it usually had something to do with how they were ""into her chocolate love"" or ""wanted a black girl to boss them around in bed"" or something else racist and degrading.  She wished people could just tell her something nice without pointing out that she was black.  How about we just compliment people for who they are and forget their skin-color-stereostypes?  There are millions of nice things that can be said of all women, and each woman is different -- they are all beatifully and wonderfully made; they are individuals."
"How do you find a legitimate work from home job?
Data Entry or working Online? any ideas
Most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things - getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program (also known as MLM or pyramid plans) OR they have their own business. Your own business is something you create yourself, not find on the internet. You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless ""opportunities"" out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?"

i think people that have sex (outside of mairage) are gross! eewwwweee!!!! all these kids having sex they so stupid!! they throw away thier future!!! lately iv been finding out that people i thought were normal are some of them sex people! i had no idea this many kids where having sex, i knew there was a few but i though it was pretty rare (iv only been in public school for this school year's 9 weeks) i want a precentage so i can more esily determin wether my suspiscions about certain people are correct.
too many kids in hig school are having sex becasue they see it and hear it every where.   no one teaches them about the responsibility or the dangers of having it.   a percentage is not going to help you decide who is having sex and who is not.  it is just a silly number some person sitting behind a desk got from surveying too few people.\n\nBut if you insist here is one statistic:-\nKids Having Sex \n\nCulture/Society Miscellaneous\nSource: National Liberty Journal\nPublished: March 2001 Author: NLJ Staff\nPosted on 03/10/2001 17:57:13 PST by Pistol \nIn February, True Love Waits, an innovative organization that promotes abstinence among teens, conducted a poll asking,"" What percentage of your high-school friends are haing sex?""\n\nThe answers were astounding. Only 13 % of the 6,287 respondents (as of February 16) responded that 30% of their friends were sexually involved. However, 30 % of students answered that 30 % of their friends were engaging in sex; and 38 % answered that 60 % of their friends were having sex. Additionally, 17 % said that 90 % of their friends were sexually active.\n\nThis poll illustrates the pressing need for groups like True Love Waits to get out their message.True Love Waits (www.truelovewaits.com) is currently conducting a campaign called ""Seize The Net,"" [sic] in which they encourage young people to sign a pledge of purity. That pledge, already signed by more than one-million students, reads:\n\nBelieving that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, my friends, my future mate and my future children to be sexually abstinent from this day until the day I enter a biblical marriage relationship.\n\nNational Liberty Journal encourages all readers to to urge their children/grandchildren to visit the True Love Waits web page to learn how they can join other young people choosing to remain sexually pure. \n\nYou can also look here:"

"Is Joseph a paedophile?
Marry a young girl it was also common in the Jewish society.  The case of Mary the mother of Jesus comes to mind, in non biblical sources she was between 11-14 years old when she conceived Jesus.  Mary had already been ""BETROTHED"" to Joseph before conceiving Jesus.  Joseph was a much older man. therefore Mary was younger than 11-14 years of age when she was ""BETHROED"" to Joseph.\nAccording to the Priest of Saint Mary's Catholic Church: ""Mary was approximately 14 years old when she got pregnant with Jesus.  Joseph, Mary's Husband is believed to be around 36.  Mary was only 13 when she married Joseph.  When she first was arranged with Joseph she was between 7 to 9 years old.""
No he wasn't a paedophile. It was simply the culture.  There are still societies today that arrange marriages when the girl is quite young and the man is older by like 20 years. It's normal for them.  If the girl is still very young then the couple doesn't consumate the marriage until she is more mature.\nFor instance, the reason why Muhammad didn't consumate the marriage to Ayesha when he first married her was because she was far too young and also she hadn't hit puberty. She hit puberty at age 9 and therefore was now accountable for sins also (belief in islam) wheeas before she wasn't. He wasn't a paedophile for consumating the marriage at that age because the culture was such.  In both Muslim and Jewish societies this practice was common and today in many villages it still is."
"how long does one snow flake take to hit the ground?

That depends on several factors - how far above ground it begins, how wet it becomes, and its shape. The latter is important because ""snowflakes"" are most commonly an aggergation of several of them - the more flakelike ones tending to fall slower than the more shperical ones with a denser core.\n\nThe typical dry snowflake falls at about 3-4 feet per second, which means from a cloud base of 2500 feet it would take about 12 minutes - could be 20 minutes or more from some clouds. This is one reason snow flurries or sometimes even light showers can occur from a clear sky or one virtually so (if the horizon is obstructed to some extent). The snowflakes can travel horizontally 10 miles or more before reaching the ground. Another reason is that for snow I've seen clouds disappear as they deposit their remaining flakes."
"Can African Army Ants kill anything in their path?
Like say a buffalo is standing there and didn't get out of the way could the ants devour it alive?
Army ants found in Africa are called driver ants. Driver ants form huge colonies, which in some cases consist of between 10 million and 20 million workers. Driver ants have extremely powerful mandibles. Their massive swarms are capable of immobilizing and killing large prey.\n\nIf attacked you won't be dismembered and eaten, but bites from large soldiers (workers) can inflict excruciating pain. Once their jaws have snapped shut, nothing can shake them loose.\n\nColonies of these ants have no permanent nests. Instead they make temporary bivouacs by interlocking their bodies in a protective dome over the queen and her young. Periodically they use a hollow log or decaying stump for a slightly more permanent shelter. This is for about 20 days and allows the queen to lay her eggs, possibly up to 30,000 of them.\n\nThey have been known to kill Elephants believe it or not. The very few cases with human fatalites most are of them being unconscious and their calls for help being unheard."

The product is called bodybalance I am not sure just where you click to find it, there is a lot of info on the site about natural health. But I have a friend who has been overweight all her life and is now enjoying a better lifestyle, because it is so easy and so effective. Good luck and I hope this helps."
"An even number is the sum if two prime numbers. True? Why?
Example : \n10= 7+3              7 and 3 are prime numbers\n100= 53+47
This is Goldbach's conjecture and has NOT been proven\ntrue or false.  Good luck solving it!!\n\nI looked at the above answers, adn they dont seem to understand the question.  You shouldl have said:\n\nAny even number greater than 2 CAN be written as the sum of two primes. Prove true or false."
"What is the molarity of sea water. All of the salt is NaCl. Density is 1.02 grams per cubic centimeter?
The world's oceans have a salt concentration of approximately 3% salt by mass of which the majority is Sodium Chloride. What is the molarity of sea water. Hint: Assume that all of the salt is NaCl and that sea water has a density of 1.02 grams per cubic centimeter (1.02 kg./L)
You can find in ""Chemical Engineer's Handbook"", from Perry-Chilton, graphics for density of water + NaCl solution vs. %w/w of NaCl. The NaCl concentration is 3.5%"
"is it right for an employer to fire someone when that person had a doctors appointment?

Depends on where you work, and if your appointment was an emergency. Also depends on the fine print when you signed your application or any other documents. Even a statement on your application such as ""_______ co. reserves the right to ________...., by signing you agree to all terms and conditions of employment at _________ co."" can bind you to all kinds of rules that you dont know about unless you request all of the literature and actually read it. \n\nYou can't just bring a note and be excused, this isnt high school. employers can fire you for basically any reason, provided it isnt a reason based on discrimination. Even if they want to fire you because of a prejudice (such as race), they will just wait for you to make a mistake then use that one mistake in the report as your reason for being fired. And you cant dispute it because you cant prove otherwise.\n\nFor a lot of places, unless its a life or death emergency, if your absence isnt pre-approved (24 hours in advance usually), then it is counted as a no-show, regardless of whether you called. At plenty of places I've worked the handbook clearly states that after 3 unapproved or unexcused absences, it constitutes strict disapline (such as suspension) or termination of employment.\n\nDont even try to go to court, you arent likely to win. Even if you do win, you will most likely only win enough to pay off your lawyer, cuz it will take such a long time to win. Especially with large corporations, which usually have several lawyers and many loopholes in your employment contract to get them out of just such a situation."

We are not only in a battle in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We are in a battle for the heart and soul of our country as we speak.  Fewer and fewer people are alive today who have experienced the real fear of the possibility that we can as a nation cease to exist.  \nThat was a very real fear in WW II.\n\nThose who have never faced this fear do not truly understand what types of sacrifices must be made by those who are free to keep this freedom.  We are facing the most dangerous threat to the future of the civilized world  that I believe the world has EVER seen.  The goal of radical Islam is TOTAL world domination and a worldwide Islamic society under Sharia law.  It will take the sacrifices and dedication of men like we saw on this video to turn back that tide.  It will also require that citizens of the USA stand united behind our military men and be willing to authorize and accept any and all necessary actions against this goal.\n\nWe must do ANYTHING that is necessary to halt the spread of RADICAL ISLAM.  I promise you the followers of RADICAL ISLAM have dedicated themselves to do whatever is necessary to take our liberty and freedom."

"Stat whether each of the following substances is acidic, basic or neutral?
a) has a ph of 7\nb) produces hydroxide ions in water solution\nC) has a pH of 12\nd) has a pH of 3\ne)H2SO4\nf)Ca(OH)2\nAny help would be appreciated
a) neutral\nb) basic\nc) basic\nd) acidic\ne) acidic if in solution\nf) basic.\n\npH is a scale ranging from 0-14.  7 is the intermediate and a pH of 7 means that the solution is neutral.  If the pH is below 7, then there are more H+ than OH- in the solution.  Hence the solution becomes acidic.  If the pH however is greater than 7, then there is less H+ than OH- in the solution and the solution is basic.\n\nFor the acid H2SO4, when in solution, it will dissociate to form H+ and SO4-.  The H+ gives the acid its acidic property.  Similarly when Ca(OH)2 is dissolved, it dissociates into Ca2+ and OH-.  The OH- gives the compound its basic property."

"Running or Cycling? URGENT?
Which one is better and burn more calories? I'm 5'1"" and 106lbs, and I need to lose 10lbs more.
Running burns more calories. If you can combine running for 10 mins consistently then do 50 lunges, run for 10 miuntes do 50 squat jumps, run for 10 mins do 50 push ups, run for 10 minutes up/down a flight of stairs, find a hill then do 10 sprints up and down, then 10 mins consistently. \n\nVariation is also the best thing to do. It means you are placing less strain on the same muscle groups and stimulating other muscles. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone."

"How can I stop my cravings for unhealthy food?
I need to find a way to surpress my appetite for fatty foods, normally I am a good eater but this miserable weather has blown my appetite for junk sky high! Any tips or advice?
What foods are you craving specifically?  If you need chocolate, you are better off eating high cocoa versions like 70% cooking chocolate.  If it is burgers, try eating chicken burgers instead of ordinary ones.\n\nI over ate last week because it was just so damned cold.  I also over eat if I am stressed out.  Think about how you are feeling at the moment and if you are stressing about something, do something to sort it out.  Exercise is really good for stress but if you are feeling stressed the last thing you want to do is exercise.  Catch 22!\n\nGood luck!"
"was moon landing a hoax?
i don think it was real..'cos till date why hasn't there been another attempt to go there..and how cud there be proper landin eqipment then..
No, the moon landing was not a hoax.\n\nOn one of the moon landings, the astronauts left a mirror on the surface of the moon which is being used even today to measure the distance between the earth and moon with lasers.\n\nWhat is the point of sending more people there?  We've developed robotics to the point where unmanned probes can go more cost effectively, with lower risk to human life, and they can stay longer.  Take the Mars rovers.  They've been on Mars roaming around for more than a year, collecting samples, taking pictures, measuring the soil and atmosphere.  They don't require food or water.  They don't get lonely for their loved ones.  If the ""die"", no one will mourn them.  Frankly, it makes little sense to send someone to the Moon (again) or Mars to perform these tasks.\n\nBut, back in the 60's, robotics were not so sophisticated.  Sending a person to do the job made more sense.  A human could control the space craft.  A human could make course corrections.  A human could pick up rocks, put them in a bag, and bring them back.  Yeah, the technology was primitive, but primitive technology has not stopped humans from doing amazing things."

"Why would you be baptized in the words, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?
The Bible plainly states several times to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ...\n\nActs 19:4,5 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.\n 5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\nActs 2:38 ""...repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ...""\n\n***Matthew 28:19 DOES NOT SAY TO BE BAPTIZED IN THE WORDS FATHER, SON, AND HOLY SPIRIT. IT PLAINLY SAYS IN THE NAME. (JESUS) Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost""
The proper form of baptism is in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as Jesus designated in Matt. 28:19, ""Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.""  The clear command of Jesus is to baptize this way.  But, if that is so, then why do we see so many instances in the New Testament where people were baptized ""in Jesus' name""? \n\nThe reason they were baptizing ""in the name of Jesus"" is not because it was a formula, but because the phrase, ""in the name of"" means ""in the authority of.  We can see proof of this in Acts 4:7-10,\n\n""And when they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, 'By what power, or in what name, have you done this?' 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, 'Rulers and elders of the people, 9 if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, 10 let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good health.'""\n\n     The Jews asked ""by what power, or in what name, have you done this?""  Peter answers and says that it was in the name of Jesus, that they had healed.  In other words, ""in the name of Jesus"" means that it is by the power and authority found in Christ.\n\nThe only bible that disputes Matthew 28:19 is the New World Translation bible. That Bible was mis-translated and changed by the Jw cult. No bible scholar or language expert takes that bible serious."

"importance of studying precipitation reaction?

In the pharmaceutical industry, the precipitation of active pharmacuetical ingredients to their solid form is very key.  This is because the different solvents and or precipitation conditions can potentially form different polymorphic forms (they can pack in different repeatable patterns when precipitating) that can be redissolved differently and even have different melting points.  The importance of this is that each polymorphic form can be patented independently which essentially for lisencing purposes makes it a new drug free of patent restrictions since its redissolution properties are most likely different (which is related to drug delivery in vivo).\n\nThe overall purity of a product can be changed by altering the precipitation conditions.  The goal is to find a set of conditions that are most selective to the molecule of interest over undesirables."
"right to privacy and the blogger?
hello to all,\n\n\nI am a student and i am doing a research regarding the right to privacy\n\n\n\nand bloggers.\n\n\nso i am asking for your help and your opinion and would like to post a\nfew questions.\n\n\nfirst, i guess none of you believe a right to privacy even exist for\nthe blogger. if any one object i would like to hear\nsecondly, think about it, yes, as a blogger, you published your blog on\n\n\n\nthe net, but can someone/or a reoprter quote you or criticize you on a\npublic or well know newspaper?\n\n\nmoreover, if a blogger concider himself a journalist, is he obligated\nto the right to privacy of the person he writes about?\n\n\nanyother question and answer will be more than welcome \n\n\nthank you
In my opinion if you put something out in public space you should expect it to be public. Also since it is not copyrighted it is not protected in the fact that someone can come along and use what you say in another public forum without giving you/blogger credit. \n If the blogger has any common sense/civility he should let his friends know that what they say could end up on his blog just like a journalist should be letting his quotes know that they will end up in print/ public view."

The marketing materials, free screenings for ministers so they'd guide their flock to see the movie too.\n\nFor those saying ""Read the bible, it's true.""

THE FIRST CREDIT CARD I GOT WAS FROM THE WOMEN'S EXPRESS STORE ABOUT A YEAR AN A HALF AGO. IT WAS A CREDIT LIMIT OF $150. AFTER I PAID ON IT FAITHFULLY FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, I STARTED GETTING CREDIT CARDS OFFERS IN THE MAIL. I FOUND SOME GOOD ONES WITH A FIXED RATE AND I WAS APPROVED FOR ONE OF THEM WITH A $1000 CREDIT LIMIT. I PAID THEM OFF, BUT LEFT THEM OPEN WITH A $0 BALANCE. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO RAISE YOUR CREDIT SCORE. SO NOW I GET AT LEAST 2 CREDIT CARD OFFERS A DAY AND HAVE A CREDIT CARD WITH A BALANCE WITH $3000 NOW. (DON'T WORRY, I CAN PAY FOR THAT) :-) BUT JUST MAKE SURE YOU CAN PAY FOR THE BALANCE CUZ YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOURSELF IN CREDIT CARD DEBT. SO START OFF WITH A SMALL RETAIL STORE, THEN EVENTUALLY YOU'LL MOVE INTO BIGGER CREDIT CARD COMPANIES. GOOD LUCK!\n\nPS. SO WITHIN A YEAR AN A HALF, I WENT FROM HAVING NO CREDIT TO VERY HIGH CREDIT SCORE. JUST LEAVE CREDIT CARDS OPEN WITH A ZERO BALANCE.

I dont mean to offend anyone with the question Im about to ask, but I really need help with me final. I am to write a paper in which I take a side on. My topic is,"" Should Homosexuals be allowed to serve in the armed forces?"" Please give me your input.
There are TONS of gays in the military. I have many friends who have served this country in a variety of capacities, from Navy special forces (thats right, a GAY SEAL!) to National Guard and JAG. I hate that people assume that ""don't ask don't tell"" means there are no queers in the military. There are so many - and its just absolutely wrong that they risk their lives every day, and cannot be open about something so minor in comparison. \n\nThe thing is, theres just no legitimate argument for why gays shouldn't be allowed to serve. Do our trigger fingers not work? Are we incapable of teamwork, dedication, or enduring hardship? The worst bigots in this capacity are those who HAVEN'T served. How dare they criticize anyone willing to do what our soldiers do, for any reason at all?"

It is most likely a satellite. Several can usually be seen every evening, if you look for them.

The warm air pushes the moisture higher into the colder air layers....as the moisture droplets freeze together  they fall and enter the warm air currents which pushes them back up to the cold layers..this happens until enough layers are built up, that the updrafts can't support the weight and the ice falls to the ground in the form of hailstones."

Actually, it is how you were raised.  You were probably raised with morals and values and a lot of kids now days are not.  I am correcting my children when they do not use yes ma'am and no ma'am and if do not say Mr or Mrs.  It is only raising or the lack there if these children do not say it.

"is the gosple of philip true?

The Gospel of Philip is part of the Apocrypha, or books from both the Old and New Testament that did not make it into the canon.  There are many other books that did not make it into the Bible that we hold in our hands today, for a variety of reasons.  \n\nThose reasons include heresy, such as Gnosticism, as well as works that were too fragmentary, or which repeated other works and seemed to be multiple letters sent to different churches, or folktales which are nice stories but not exactly religious or instructive per se.\n\nHaving taken courses on the New Testament and the Apocrypha at UCLA -- and having thoroughly enjoyed both courses and learned an incredible amount -- there is much to be learned from the Apocrypha.  There is also the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Peter, the Gospel of Mary and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.  \n\nAs for its truth, there is much to be learned from the Apocrypha, since it is still studied today; just take it with a grain of salt.  Determine for yourself what is the truth and what is not by reading, studying, researching and talking to people.  Asking your question here is a good start; good luck with your quest.  May you find many more answers... and questions, too.\n\nCheers, K"
"Please solve this question?
Find mean, mode and median of continuous distribution defined by f(x)=sin x , 0<=x<=pi/2
f(x) = sinx on [0,pi/2] is 1-1 on this interval, therefore there can be no mode, since all values occur only once.\n\nThe mean is equal to the area under f(x) = sinx on this inteval divided by the length of the interval.  In this case, it is 1/[pi/2-0] = 1/(pi/2) = 2/pi.\n\nThe mode is the value where half the area is below this value and half is above it.  Therefore, we want to know for what value of a is Integral from 0 to a of sinx = 1/2.  When you integrate and evaluate, you get cosa = 1/2, which means a = pi/3, so pi/3 is the median."

"i live in the east end of london (uk)?
and the majority of people living and working here are bangladeshi or pakistani! im white working class and i find that most of these people are law abiding citizens,is it fair to tar these people with the same brush as Terrorists (al quaeda) just because their muslim.
No, it's not fair at all! No group is universally good or universally bad. There may be a few extremist Islamicists, but there are also extremist Christians, and both of these sects have corrupted their religions for their own gain. People who truly follow the ways of Islam tend to be very honest, giving and hardworking people, who greatly help the British economy!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAndrea."
"I am an NRI based in UAE keen on hard earned money in India, what is the best log term investment option avbl?
Though my intrest is in safe and reliable options but I am willing to invest into Real Estate as well. I would like to know about Tax Repercussion if I invest big amounts into bonds and bank FDR's
The best option for you to invest in Real Estate because the price is appreciating very fast throughout the country.\n     Remember , If ou keep the money in FDR or Bond in India, it will be taxable because it is deemed received in India. So whatever you want to save, you should consult with your bank to invest under Non Resident account only to make the income tax free in India.\n    You may also consider the option of keeping money in Banks  abroad where  interest is higher. But still I think best option is REAL Estate in India . \n    There are lots of tax deduction on the capital gain earned on sale of the flat or land."
"is it really possible to firm up a flabby stomach after a c-section after carrying twins?
I have had  2 c-section, one  with complications,  but stomach is still  flabby  and I  seem to have no stomach muscles .  also post partum depression,  twins are now 4 years old
It is always possible to firm up your muscles.  However, your tummy may not be flat after a pregnancy.  Sometimes the stretching of the adominal wall can part the adominal muscles on each side, and allows the internal organs to pooch out a little bit...not like a hernia, but the stretch muscles can allow them to just look that way.  Pilates seem to give a lot of results in little time."

"32 years of smoking~ 44 years old. Can YOU tell me HOW to QUIT past three months?
When I reach the 3 month mark of a quit I become despondent, panicky, depressed.  I am talking ""I WANT TO BE DEAD"" depressed. I was concieved by and carried by smokers, so I know that nicotine is part of my genetic core. I have tried ALOT of methods such as ""oooh look how much money I saved"" changing ALL of my habits that remind me of smoking, and I think SMOKING is DIGUSTING.  Yet I crawl back to it to S A V E  my sanity and LIFE.
This method works for me and is the only money back guaranteed.\nI quite smoking 2 years ago\n\n\nGet the Facts\nEasyway, founded by Allen Carr in 1983, has the highest independently verified 12-month success rate (75.8% for a smoker completing the program) of any quit smoking technique and a 90% satisfaction rating. \n\nCompare Easyway to other methods and see for yourself why Easyway is called “The Cadillac of quit smoking methods.” \n\nThe Allen Carr Method\nHOW THE METHOD WORKS\n\nUsing psychotherapy, the method works in the opposite way to the “willpower” method. It does not concentrate on the reasons the smoker should not smoke : the money, the slavery, the health risks and the stigma. Smokers know all that already. Instead it focuses on why smokers continue to smoke in spite of the obvious disadvantages.\n\nIt is fear that keeps smokers hooked!\n\nFear the smoker will have to give up their pleasure or crutch. Fear the smoker will be unable to enjoy life or handle stress. Fear the smoker will have to go through an awful trauma to get free. Fear the smoker will never get completely free from the craving.\n\nThe Method removes these fears \nSmokers quit with the Allen Carr Method as happy non-smokers, not feeling deprived but with a huge sense of relief and elation that they have finally achieved what they always wanted….\n\nTO BE FREE!\n\nWhat about the terrible withdrawal pangs from nicotine?\n\nThe physical withdrawal from nicotine is so slight that most smokers don’t realise that they are addicts. What smokers suffer when they try and quit using other methods is the misery and depression caused by the belief that they are being deprived of a pleasure or a crutch.\n\nThe Allen Carr Method removes this feeling of deprivation. \nIt removes the need and desire to smoke. Once the smoker is in the right frame of mind and they follow the simple instructions, the physical withdrawal from nicotine is hardly noticeable.\n\nNo Gimmicks!\n\nThe Method does not use any gimmicks, useless aids or substitutes. No nicotine gum, patches, lozenges, tabs, inhilators or nasal sprays! No needles! No lasers! No drugs! No herbs! No shock treatment! \n\nThe Allen Carr Method is successful because:\n\nIt removes the smokers’ conflict of will. \nThere are no bad withdrawal pangs. \nIt is instantaneous and easy. \nIt is equally effective for long-term heavy smokers and light smokers. \nYou need not gain weight. \nYou will not miss smoking. \n\nMedical Endorsements\n\nA personal view from Professor Judith Mackay MBE, JP, FRCO (Edin), FRCP (Lon), World Health Organisation Advisory Panel on Tobacco and Health\n\n“I have no hesitation in supporting Allen Carr’s work. Many clinics use some of his techniques but it would appear that few do it in quite such a successful package.” \n\nCarole Johnson, Coronary Heart Disease Prevention Unit, Tyne Tees \n\n“his success rate was such that, when budgets allow, we continue to use Easyway for work with specific groups and individuals.”\n\nDr Anil Visa BSc, MBBch., FRCA, Consultant – Royal Hospitals NHS Trust – Royal London Hospital\n\n“I have observed the Allen Carr method at first hand and have found it to be very successful and I wholeheartedly support it as an effective way to quit smoking.”\n\nDr William Green, Head of Psychiatric Dept, Matilda Hospital, Hong Kong\n\n“It is a remarkable fact that Allen Carr, on his own admission a non-professional in behaviour modification, should have succeeded where countless psychologists and psychiatrists holding postgraduate qualifications have failed, in formulating a simple and effective way to stop smoking.”\n\nDr Martin Jarvis, Principle Scientist, Imperial Cancer Research \nFund and Reader in Health Psychology, University College London\n\n”...I am more than happy to testify to Allen Carr’s enduring involvement and to recognise the value of the kind of behavioural and cognitive support he provides.”\n\nDr PM Bray MB CH.b.,"

"At 31 with 2 kids, should I ""leave"" to go to school ?
i have been working in corp america since 22 years old in administrative roles.  I am tired of not making more than 35k, scraping by.  I am not even considered for other jobs without a degree. I am thinking of leaving with my children and going to a college town, applying for subsidzied housing and working my way through college, while working part time. Yet, I 've just been offered a job for, you guessed it 35k a year with tuition reimbursement, etc. what would you do?  P.S. I have a son with a disability.
You mention that the job you are now being offered includes tuition reimbursement - if you add the cost of tuition to the offered salary it raises it up quite a bit.  Why not consider taking the job for now, so you don't have to uproot everyone, and take your classes for free?  You can always decide to take more drastic measures later, if it doesn't work out."
"Life out there?
If we've determined there's not life on a particular planet or moon...does that mean there's not life, or that we don't have the technology to observe it yet?  Something I've always pondered...
But how do we know that life doesn't exist under the surface of all these moons and planets around us, as a majority of them we have never even been on top of the surface. I think it is quite egotistical of us humans to make an assumption like this when we haven't fully figured out what life is about on our own planet. Not only could their be life on other planets, but maybe we just can't process that kind of information into our brains yet, because aren't we using such a small percentage of our brains?"
"Men: ""old fashion"" or ""modern"" ?
I understand women want to be treated with respect by men, and to feel safe wherever, (and I wholey agree). However, would you rather have a modern man, ( that treats women like sex toys, despises marriage, experts the woman to pay her own way in life, and dreads fatherhood) or an old fashioned man, (that considers women precious, respects the responsibility of being a husband and father, and is proud of his, so called ""archaic"", duties as a man) ?
Old fashioned - definitely, and I hope I instilled those values in my son.  Hopefully the ""old fashioned"" man will become the new fad in a few more years the way everything seems to come around."

"How does one qualify for alimony?
Im with someone thats going through a divorce and his wife is threating him for alimony.. But she works a full time job. Can she still get that?
It typically depends on how much she makes. If she makes $15,000/year and he makes $100,000/year, she could file for and receive alimony. \n\nAlimony (from what I understand of it) is based on the idea that the spouse got used to a certain lifestyle during the marriage and now feels that he/she should be entitled to some money to get on his/her feet after the marriage ends.

"quit smoking, need help with the best method?

Quitting smoking is a great opportunity to learn about ourselves.\nCongratulate yourself  on having the desire to stop - then you are over the worst, but still need to maintain your resolve. It's just so easy to start thinking that just one won't hurt, but it does. Just one achieves nothing except feeling the need for another. Whatever you do, don't have just one. Beware - alcohol will weaken your resolve.\nHere's a few home-brewed tips that might be useful.\nIt's not just nicotine addiction - there are 50+ chemicals in cigarettes. Also the main problem is habit.\nWe have been used to having body sensations which we translate as 'my body needs something', which we have attempted to satisfy by having a cigarette.\nWhen we try to stop smoking, we still get these 'my body needs something' sensations, and we still feel that we want a cigarette. We have to train our body to be more selective. When we feel we need something, we have to work out what it is that we actually need.\nA glass of water is an excellent substitute if nothing else comes to mind, as it helps with the clearance of the toxic substances in our body. Another good substitute is a bag of salted peanuts, used in combination with the water.\nAnother thing to do is to find an activity which occupies the mind or body. Go swimming - nobody wants to smoke while they are swimming. Slowly, as our body adjusts and translates the 'want something' feelings into something other than cigarettes, then the feelings begin to go away. We know its not a cigarette that the body really needs, because as soon as we've had one we still have the feeling, and want another!\nWe will have a few bouts of feeling or even being short tempered. We must try to bite our lip, and control; ourselves. Recognise the short temper as being the removal of toxins which are trying to find a way out. They went in through the mouth, and they try to get out that way to. We must learn to keep our mouth closed, and force the toxins out the other way.\n\nAfter we have stopped for a while we will begin to feel that just one wont to any harm.\nAll that leads to is a desire for just another one. We must guard very strongly against the desire to have just one."

"doest a squat and a lunge work the same muscles and if so then which one is more effective?

Squats in general are considered most effective out of the two.  Lunges are good for finishing a workout or pre-fatiguing the legs before doing squats.  Squats are a core exercise, meaning it's one of the major main exercise that works several large muscle groups and will show the most results.\n\nHowever, good form is imperitive, and the exercise has to be intense enough to be effective.  Also, with squats you can do more weight than you can with lunges, so you can really hit the legs hard that way."

Small swallowable things are prohibited so as to alleviate the possibility of choking.\n  The pain that the child is experiencing could be because the throat is swollen and or bruised.\n  This should resolve itself in a day or two and if not,see a doctor as I suppose it is possible that more damage could have ocurred."
"How can I buy my daughter a house without tax issues?
Say we are both on the loan but I pay the down payment.  Can she own 99% of the deed without any tax issues?
The deed determines the ownership of the house, so I'll assume that the deed will show the daughter having 99% ownership of the house.  On paper, then, the daughter should pay 99% of the loan payments, so that if you are paying any part of that 99%, it's a gift from you to her.  If it's less than 11,000 a year, then it's tax free.  Do you have a wife?  If you do, you can increase this to 22,000 a year tax free.  If your daugher has a husband, then this can be increased to 44,000 a year tax free, even if your daughter alone still retains 99% ownership of the house.  Finally, there's the unifed tax credit, which is how much you can give away without taxes while living, I believe it's up to 1,000,000 for you, and another 1,000,000 for your wife if you have one.  If you've already used this up or don't want to dip into this, consider a simple loan to your daughter, whereby the payments you make on her behalf are simply added to the principal of this loan, and AFR interest charged, roughly 5% a year, so that when SHE finally dies, her estate will owe you or inheritors the balance of that loan.  These options doesn't exhaust the possibilities, but a lot more information is needed to construct something. Get a good tax lawyer."

"for christians only please!?
what do you do to completely surrender yourself to god? i feel convicted by the holy spirit and dont know why god gave me a dream last night that seemed so real as i asked him why he hasnt yet used me to win souls
We need to understand that as christians, we are in a growth pattern.  The process of growth on earth for us humans is a pattern to teach us about the pattern of growth in spiritual terms.  Some grow faster than others and some stagnate for a while and then have a growth spurt.  God is not going to put you into the field to win souls until you are ready for that.  You dont want to push people away from God because you are too immature for that task and you dont want to blindly run around trying to win souls that the Holy Spirit hasnt moved you to approach.  Once you are mature enough, if it is in His will, He will send you out. \n\nAlso, this may not be your calling, you may have another calling in which you will help save a few souls but only through the vocation He has chosen for you.  It will be what makes you most happy so you needn't worry about that, but it may be that you only end up reaching only a few souls in your life.  \n\nJust remember, you are not the difference between salvation and eternal hell for someone.  If someone needs ministered to, the Lord will see to it that it happens.  So dont fear that souls are falling into hell because you aren't ready yet, the Lord is in control and He will be sure to send those into the field that need to be there for someone."

who knows of a way, other than starving yourself or drinking my food to lose 10lbs in a week?\n\n\nMind you I cant really do any excercises, i have a herniated disk in my back. I think losing this BIG A$$ TIRE from around my waist and back will help with the pain....\n\n\nand please no rude comments...thats not why I posted this.....
Honestly it is unhealthy to loose more than 5 pounds in a week if you want to start loosing weight start by changing your eating habits. You only need 1200 calories per day to live. These need to be right calories. You should take a multivitamin and do start working with a physical therapist on a workout program that fits you special needs. You should speak to nutritionist about a 1200 calorie per day diet and stick to the menu plan they give you. The first ten pounds you loose will be water after that it will be harder to lose the weight so you must be dedicated to what ever program you go with. You must also approach this with a positive attitude and look at it as a change of lifestyle not a temporary vanity kick. Loosing weight is a process you can't just do it over night and have the weight stay off."

Quoting by Eric V:\n""From Sum's first statement we know that x+y is a sum none of whose possible components are both prime (x+y is not even)""\n\nin fact, from Sum's first statement, the significant deduction is that x+y is not even. And you deduce it just because if it were even, there would be a possibility that the two numbers be both odd, and among this there would be the possibility that x+y were both prime: so if x+y were even, Sum would not be able to be sure that Prod could not know the numbers.\n\nPay attention:\nYou're not saying that x+y even ---> x and y not prime.\nYou're saying that x and y both prime ---> x+y even\n\n(Anyway an additional and not told assumption is that x and y are > 2)"
"Does an animal/human lose bone mass/bone strength when feeding its young with milk?

Jeeze... OK, people... please realize that bones are connected to mammary glands, though the connection is not a direct one...  \n\nBones are made of mineralized proteins. That is, they have a loose structure made of proteins, which are like fibers (think of the protein as like rebar in concrete) around the protein (rebar) are placed minerals (cement) such as Calcium and Phosphate ions. When breast feeding, a woman needs calcium to be available to make milk, but obviously her body doesn't want to liberate all of her bones' calcium. Two hormones regulate calcium levels in the blood, Calcitonin and Parathormone. Parathormone (parathyroid hormone) increases blood levels of Ca, whereas calcitonin decreases blood levels of Ca. These hormones either stimulate bone cells to free Ca into the blood, or put it back into bone, respectively. When nursing, the mother is, of course, using some of her Ca reserves. It's important to note, though, that much of this is replaced by diet, and that there are hormonal checks in place to make sure Calcium depletion doesn't happen. So, no, a healthy woman with a good diet can nurse all she wants. Calcium supplements are not a bad idea, though.\n\nAlso, for God's sake, we don't produce Calcium! It's a mineral, and we have to get it from our diet."

The point to grasp is that every ten folds means just over a thousand times increase in the height of the resulting pile of paper.\n\nA ream of ordinary 70 gsm photocopy paper is 500 sheets and about 2 inches thick, \n\nSo let us say that after 10 folds of our theoretically infinitely large (i.e. as large as we need it to be) piece of paper we have 1,024 thicknesses (2^10) and that that is 4 inches thick (a third of a foot).\n\nAfter 20 folds we have 2^20 thicknesses = 4096 inches = 341 feet 4 inches.\n\nThe Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall, so after 22 folds of the paper it has grown taller than the height of a 102-floors-tall skyscraper,\n\nThere are 5280 feet in a mile, \n\nAfter 30 folds we have 2^30 thicknesses = 349,184 feet 4 inches = 116,395 yards = 66.13 miles. i.e. it was over a mile high after 24 folds and more than 2 miles high after 25 folds\n\nMount Everest is only 5 miles high so the pile of paper was taller than Mount Everest after 27 folds.\n\nThe moon is 238,000 miles away on average (let us not worry about apogee and perigee).\n\nAfter 40 folds we have 2^40 thicknesses = 1,024 x 66.13 miles = 67,720 miles i.e. more than a quarter of the way to the moon.\n\nSo clearly 42 folds more than suffices to take us to the moon. How about the Sun?\n\nThe Sun is on average 93,000,000 miles away (let us not worry about perihelion and aphelion)\n\nAfter 50 folds we have 2^50 thicknesses = 1,024 x 67,720 miles = 69,345,477 miles \n\nSo after 50 folds, we would then be most of the way to the sun. 51 folds more than suffices to get there. So how about Jupiter?\n\nThere are on average 486,587,517 miles to Jupiter. So another couple of folds should do the trick. 53 folds = 8 x 69,345,477 miles = 554,762,813 miles i.e. 53 folds more than suffices to get to Jupiter, And 56 is ample for the short hop to Pluto.\n\nAnd the nearest star?\n\n1 light year = 5.879 ×10^12 miles\n4.2 light years = 24.69 ×10^12 miles\n\nAfter 60 folds we have 2^60 thicknesses = 1,024 x 69,345,477 miles =  71,009,769,448 miles\n\nAfter 70 folds we have 2^70 thicknesses = 1,024 x 71,009,769,448 miles = 72,714,002,890,752 miles (72 x 10^12 miles)\n\nSo clearly 69 folds gets us to Proxima Centauri and half way back again! 70 would take us to Sirius (8.6 light years away) and half way back again. Or, more interestingly, it would easily take us to Epsilon Eridani b, the nearest known extra-solar planet (10.5 light years away),\n\nI will leave you to work out how many folds you would need to get to the nearest galaxy!"

"Is the atomic radius of sodium atom larger than that of chlorine atom? What happens when they turn into ions?

The Sodium (Na) atom is much larger by comparison to the Chlorine (Cl) atom.\nThe periodic trend of atomic radii gets smaller as you move accross a row.  Since Sodium is at the start of the row and Chlorine at the end, Sodium is larger.\nThis has to due to with the largest shell holding electrons, both Na and Cl's largest shell is the 2S orbital, but since Chlorine has many more protons in its nucleus, those electrons are held more closely than those of Sodium.\n\nOn the other hand, when an atom becomes an ion, it either gains or looses an electron (protons dont change).  When Sodium becomes an ion, it looses 1 electron to become Na+ and because of this, it looses the electron in its outer shell which is making it so big (ion is smaller than the atom).\nWhen Chlorine becomes an ion, it gains an electron which goes into completing its Octet and the ion is larger than the atom.\nWhen all is said and done, the Chloride ion (Cl-) is much larger than the Sodium ion (Na+)."

"Potassium and heart?
hello, is potassium good for the heart? and how much is too much or too little..what does potassium do for the heart?\n\nthanks..\n\ndan
With the exception of calcium and phosphorus, no other mineral is as abundant in the human body as potassium. Most people don't need to take supplements of this mineral because it's so widely available in foods such as bananas, orange juice, and potatoes.\n\nPotassium's task is a formidable one, primarily because of its role as an electrolyte, a mineral that takes on a positive or negative charge when dissolved in the watery medium of body fluids. (Sodium and chloride are other important electrolytes.) To regulate blood pressure and muscle contraction, and to keep nerves, kidneys, and a host of other body processes working properly, the body needs to maintain these electrolytes in a delicate balance.\n\nIn addition, potassium aids in converting blood sugar (glucose, the body's foremost fuel), into glycogen, a form of energy that can be stored in the muscles and liver and released as needed. \n\nA healthy intake of potassium through foods is valuable for general health and can even help to maintain normal blood pressure. In fact, a diet high in potassium-rich food may help to protect against heart disease and stroke, according to various studies. One study found that people with high blood pressure who had a daily serving of a potassium-rich foods decreased their risk of fatal stroke by 40%. Whether this effect was entirely due to the potassium is not entirely clear, however.\n\nResearch also indicates that an adequate level of potassium may have a role to play in regulating heartbeat, staving off heart-rhythm abnormalities, and preventing kidney stones.\n\nSpecifically, potassium may help to:  Reduce high blood pressure. Scientists have long known that potassium helps maintain blood pressure. According to the latest studies, people who regularly consume high-potassium foods, such as bananas, avocados, and yogurt, have lower blood pressure than those who don't. For example, in a recent review of 33 studies that examined the effect of potassium on blood pressure, researchers discovered that participants who started out with normal blood pressure and then added 2,340 mg of potassium daily (from foods, supplements, or both) were able to lower their risk of developing high blood pressure by 25%. The reductions were ultimately greatest for people who already had high blood pressure.\nA potassium-rich diet may even enable people with high blood pressure to slash their daily dose of prescription medication. In one study of 54 adults with high blood pressure, the majority (81%) of those who were placed on a high-potassium diet--they ate three to six servings of potassium-rich foods daily--were able to safely and dramatically reduce their dosage of high blood pressure medications within 12 months. In contrast, only 29% of those who continued with their normal diets were able to do so. \n\nRecommended Intake:  Most adults easily get an adequate and safe amount of potassium--about 5.6 g--from foods every day. In fact, there is no RDA for potassium. By law, over-the-counter supplements cannot contain more than 99 mg of potassium per pill, a ruling that applies to multivitamin and mineral preparations as well. Higher doses are available only by prescription and are necessary only in very special situations, such as the use of diuretics that promote potassium loss. \n\nIf You Get Too Little:  A seriously low level of potassium--a condition called hypokalemia--is an uncommon event but can occur in people who lose large amounts of fluid from severe diarrhea, sweating, or vomiting. Hypokalemia occurs most frequently among people who take diuretics--medications that promote urination and thus lessen the volume of fluid in the body. Although these drugs often help in regulating blood pressure, they also promote the excretion of potassium through the urine, posing the risk for very low potassium levels and related muscle cramps and fatigue.\n\nSome rare endocrine disorders (Liddle's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, Fanconi"
"Can Someone Help Me Out On This?
I heard that the female clitoris behaves pretty much like the male penis. Is it true? Does the clitoris have erectile tissue too? Also which is the easiest way to find a g-spot? And how is it done? What are the ""tools"" required?
The cells that develope into a clitoris in females are the same cells that turn into the penis in males.  Indeed is acts in a similar way.  Keep in mind that developmental biology is not as exact as that.  But for the layman, lets just say that they come from the same clump of cells.  G-spots.

Formerly, the connotation of ""mole"" was ""gram molecular weight."" Current usage tends to apply the term ""mole"" to an amount containing Avogadro's number of whatever units are being considered. Thus, it is possible to have a mole of atoms, ions, radicals, electrons, or quanta. This usage makes unnecessary such terms as ""gram-atom,"" ""gram-formula weight,"" etc."
"Question About LVNV Funding?
I got a free credit report, and found these guys on there.  Never got anything from them (extension of credit, etc) yet claim I owe money...how can i remove?  Thank you!
They are a collection agency. One of the worst.\n\nYou may have had an account that was charged off and sold.\nIf you have not had an account go bad and sold, then it isn't yours. Which is almost as hard to remove as an account that is yours.\n\nIf you discover that it is your account, you need to find out what the statute of limitations (SOL) are in your state. If you are out of SOL on the account you can really persue this hard. If you are still well within SOL, tread lightly. \n\nAlthough they have already violated your rights by placing that account on your reports without first notifying you of the debt, (which they are known to do) they can try to sue. That's why ""anything"" you do about this, keep a very detailed papertrail. If they should sue, you will have plenty of counterclaims against them.\n\nSend LVNV a debt validation letter. Send it certified mail return receipt. When you get the green card back (and you ""know"" it is not your account) send the credit bureaus a letter that it is not your account and it has been placed on your reports in error and to please delete this damaging account.\n\nIf you find it actually is your account, send the credit bureaus a dispute. Pick a couple errors out that is on that tradeline (theres probably quite a few) and base your dispute on those. \n\nFor example: they are listing the tradeline as open with a past due balance (violations)\n\nTell the credit bureaus in your letter that LVNV is violating your rights by listing an inaccurate account. They are claiming that it is an open account with a past due balance. Please correct this or delete this account.\n\nMore than likely LVNV will verify before validating with you (another violation) and you will have to go through all of it again.\n\nIf you are out of SOL, after going through this process several times, you should file complaints with the FTC, BBB and your states attorney general.  \n\nIf you discover that it is your account and if you want to pay it, be sure to send a debt validation letter (CMRRR) After they have ""properly"" validated the debt, send a pay for delete letter. \n\nInclude in that letter that they will delete the account after receiving payment, that they will not continue to collect the debt, that they will not sell the debt or the remainder of the debt - if they agree to being paid only a percentage of the debt (which you should also request)\n\nI would recommend clicking the first link and reading on how bad this company really is.\n\nI would also recommend checking out the second site that I have linked and do some reading. \n\nLearn and use your rights.\n\n\nedited to add: When disputing with the credit bureaus, do not use the free FACT-Act reports. Using those gives the credit bureaus an extra 15 days to complete their investigation. Which could make the difference in the account remaining instead of being deleted. Order your paid reports from each of the bureaus. \n\nDo not order a tri-merge report either, those are often inaccurate."
"what is the alpha course?
my friend asked me to go on it and i m really confused as to what it actually is
I think it is the program for introducing the basics of Christianity to those interested. \n\nThe Alpha Course originated in the United Kingdom at Holy Trinity Brompton Church — an Anglican church in London — through curates Nicky Gumbel and Sandy Millar. The earliest versions go as far back as 1977. Gumbel began teaching the current version in 1990. He acknowledges that it is always open to revision.The Alpha Course is an array of videos, audiocassettes, books, booklets, testimonials and leader’s videos and guidebooks.\n\nIf you want to join it, here are some tips,\n\n1 Aim to attend an Alpha conference\nNicky Gumbel has said ‘Running Alpha without attending a conference, is like driving a car without taking any lessons.’ \n\nChurches that have not attended a conference often make the mistakes listed below. If you have not yet attended a conference we would strongly encourage you to come to one of the conferences listed in Conferences. We have found that those churches whose course leaders have attended a conference have experienced a far higher degree of success with their courses.\n\n2 Think about your team carefully\nIf you get the right people leading and helping on the course you will often get three times more people actually attending the course. The right leaders and helpers are those satisfying this simple test: ‘If I had a friend who was not a Christian, would I be happy to put my friend in that person’s group?’ Into that test is rolled a number of other factors: are they confident, positive, outgoing people who naturally relate to those outside the church?\n\n3 Stay in training\nTraining the team is absolutely essential. Every member should attend the team training sessions before each course. This helps to refresh their memories and to build unity in your team. We also recommend the team reads the books Searching Issues and Telling Others. \n\n4 Follow the recipe\nAlpha is tried and tested. It has been running for more than 20 years. Every ingredient is there for a very important reason. Those churches that leave out an ingredient such as the meal or some other aspect of the course diminish the impact of the course.\n\n5 Don't forget the weekend away\nA day with talks on the person and work of the Holy Spirit works very well. A weekend works far far better. Churches that have cut this out have often been disappointed with the outcome of their course. If you need help with the weekend or day away, contact your Alpha adviser who can give advice or even arrange for a team to come and help you.\n\n6 Plan the talks\nThe ideal is a live speaker doing the talks well. It is very hard to sustain a course where the talks have been done badly. The videos provide a safety net and are often the best solution, especially with smaller groups.\n\n7 Keep Alpha rolling\nAlpha is not a quick-fix solution to church growth. It is a long-term strategy which, when run well over an extended period, leads to a constant stream of new people. It should be run as a rolling programme three times a year. This is important to keep the momentum going."

"if  the bible is writen by man and are just stories and has been written over and over for dimatic effic?

The Bible is true.  It was written by men who were inspired by God to write what they wrote.... sorry for the confusing wording.  Even if you don't believe in God, the Bible is full of historical facts.  You can go back thousands of years in history and some of the same events will be recorded in the Bible.\n\nThe English versions are different because people translate the Greek and Hebrew text differently.  Like, the King James Version was translated by candlelight in the 1600s, and since it is one of the oldest versions, it is taken by some as the one and only true Bible.  The newer versions, however, may even be more credible because of newer technology and electric lights.  There are different versions of the Bible because there are not always English words that acurately portray what was written in Hebrew or Greek, so the people who translate it are forced to get creative in what the foreign word means.  Also, our language changes so dramatically over time that newer versions are needed so people who speak the newer English will more easily understand the Bible.  Like, we don't speak with ""thee"" and ""thou"" or ""shall"" and ""needst"" so it is adjusted for better understanding, but the stories are the same, wonderful events that happened so long ago."

"Question is from light chapter of physics?
2 plane mirrors M1 and M2 have a length 20m each and are 10cm apart.A ray  of light is incident on one end of the mirror M2 at an angle of 30degree. The number of reflections the light undergoes before reaching the other end will be?
Every time the ray of light goes from one mirror to the other, it goes through a certain distance d along the mirrors axis (in the 20m direction).   The law of reflection says that the angle of incidence is the same angle as the one the ray will leave the mirror surface, so, we can build a right triangle, with the reflected ray of light as the hypotenuse.  So, we have:\n\nr*Sin( theta ) = d    and   r*Cos( theta ) = a\n\nDividing the first over the second:\n\nSin( theta ) / Cos ( theta ) = d / a\n\nOr:    Tan( theta ) = d / a\n\n            --->   d = a*Tan( theta )\n\ntheta being 30 degrees and a being 10cm = 0.1m\n\nNow, just divide 20m over d and you're good to go.\n\nHope I helped."
"How do we decide what is sick and deplorable?  What changes our minds?
How do we as a society decide what is disgusting and wrong?  What makes us decide if something with a history of being socially unacceptable should suddenly be alright?\n\nIf you were gay 50 years ago (for example), you'd be evil, disgusting, and a filthy Communist.  What changes society's mind the way it does?
I believe that as a society, and speaking narrowly just upon the AMERICAN society, that it goes back to the roots of the country. It is that way with every place on earth, though. In our case...the roots of the society we live in were set by people following a Christian religion. This isn't right or wrong, this is just fact. The Native Americans had their forms of practice and religion practically shoved aside. All of our rules, our social limitations, laws, perceptions of society and proper etiquette; these were all established for the country by those before us.\n\nWe're lucky enough to live in a place where we have outside influences flowing in. We're constantly exposed to other cultures and ways of thinking. I think this may be why we are changing as a society on our views (I know, it seems to be so slow!).  People challenge pre-concieved notions. We see other ways of viewing the world and can either decide to allow our minds to expand and accept new things, or to remain on the paths of thinking that those before us followed.\n\nOn the other hand...majority of humans DO just follow in the steps of those before them. There's a large part of the human mind programmed to ""fit in with the rest of the tribe"", which is why for some people it's so damned hard to just be different and think differently.\n\nI was just thinking about all of this last night, actually....\n\n...there are still places in the world where they eat their dead, let the vultures pick the bones dry, then allow the mother to hold the bones for her grieving period of a few days before burial. \n\n...not to mention places they eat live bugs.\n\n...but then again...Americans have weird costums, too. ;)\n\nThanks for a thought-provoking question!"

"How far north have killer bees gotten to date?
Haven't heard much info for awhile.
Africanized honey bees (killer bees) have been collected in over 50% of counties in Texas.  The policy is for beekeepers to consider the entire state as africanized.  As for how far they will go, According to studies conducted by researchers with the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the situation is likely to mirror what has taken place in Argentina. A southern zone will develop where feral honey bees are almost completely Africanized and a northern zone will continue to be populated almost completely by our more familiar bees. A transition area will likely exist between these two zones in which the two groups interbreed and their behavior will stretch across the entire range of defensiveness."

For humans, although most parts of our bodies don't have much hair anymore (well, most of us), the goosebumps occur where the hair follicles used to be and they are trying to make those hairs stand on end. When you're cold the same thing happens because standing hair is a better insulation than hair laying down."

"What Powers The Brain?
I know that the brain uses electrical inpulses to control body functions and the thought process.  But without batteries, how can electrical impulses be generated?  Is it purely chemical?
Yes, it's purely chemical potential that drives neural impulses.  Recall what it is that powers batteries themselves?  Chemical potential.  In the voltaic cell or common battery this potential is generated by reactions between a chemical, most often a very strong acid like sulfuric acid, and some material, usually a metal like copper.  In the brain, the potential difference is a result of 2 chemicals, sodium and potassium.  That's it in a nutshell."
"what is DMD(Doshin Muscular Distrpphy) in medical terms? is it hereditary disease? do u have any cure for this
I have seen persosns suffering from this disease functioning normally in young age. As they get aged every single organ stops to function.I have heard that it is only due to heredity and ancestral and there is no cure for this disease. Only now research works are going on.
It's called Duchenne M.S. This is inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait. Most patients die by 20 years old. It's a progressive disease process."
"How much plankton is in the sea and How does so much plankton exist in the sea?

There used to be a larger content of biomatter in sea water than there is currently, but it is safe to assume that a millilitre of sea water will contain organisms visible under the microscope. Chemically, this is the total organic carbon content of the water.\n\nThe main reason why there is so much life is the presence of great amounts of dissolved calcium hydrocarbonate, which will offer plants (algae) the matter to expand and which can be transformed by beast life."
"I have really gray teeth due to tetrocycline drugs when I was young.  Anything new out there to whitten them?

tet stain will only slightly lighten with even the best professional whiteners. you need to have something done like crowns or veneers. keep in mind veneers are thin and if your stain is on the more severe end of the spectrum it could still show through. I would recommend a Porcelain Fused to Noble Metal Crown be placed on at least your front six teeth. Maybe even 8 depending on how wide your smile is. This looks beautiful, but keep in mind it is a large investment and you must keep up with regular dental cleanings to maintain this type of dental work. Good Luck."

Love will find you soon, and if not, then know that your family and friends loved you just as well."
"What is the purpose of measuring density of a liquid w/ sugar, diet soda, and regular soda content?

Probably to determine the amount of dissolved solids (commonly called ""Total Dissolved Solids"" or ""TDS"") in it.  Dissolved solids are anything dissolved in the water that will leave a residue when evaporating it to dryness.  \n\nIn this case it will consist primarily of sugar, except for the diet, which will have no sugar.\n\nMore about TDS:  The reason you can detect the density difference between pure water and sugar water, is that most solids will have a higher density than water.  Therefore, when they are mixed or dissolved in the water, they will increase the density."
"Could the universe be a constant size, with everything in it shrinking uniformly?
Scientists tend to state that the universe is expanding. Doesn't it make more sense, assuming that nothing exists outside the universe: that it is infinitely small from that viewpoint. It seems more logical to me that everything contained in it is imploding in on itself at the same rate that scientists claim the universe is expanding? If everything within the universe is shrinking, then everything would appear (via observations) to be moving away from each other. If all the elementary particles are shrinking at the same rate the observations would be exactly the same wouldn't they? My reasoning is that if the universe is infinitely small (or large - take your pick) it cannot change size because infinity is constant. Therefore the only way for the observations we make (the expansion) to make sense is for the contents of the universe to be shrinking relative to the size of the entire universe.
This is an interesting idea, and yes it is plausible.  Unfortunately, there is no way for us to surmise whether or not it is true, so this is something that can never make the status of a scientific theory.  \n\n(Misconception: most people think a theory is just an idea, but a true scientific theory must stand up to experimental scrutiny in order for it to make the status of a theory.  Since this concept is impossible to test or verify, it can never be a theory, and must stay in the realm of ideas and friendly debates.)\n\nHere is another cool thing to consider:\nThe Universe cannot be infinite, because it is expanding, which points to its origin where everything began at the same point, namely the singularity of the Big Bang. Therefore, if it is expanding, it is bounded.\n\nHowever, it is thought that it probably doesn't have an edge, much like the Earth doesn't have an edge. If you started in a spaceship and went in a straight line, you would eventually end up where you started, much like if you started at the North Pole and went in a straight line, you would end up back the North Pole.\n\nThe reason: although you would be going in a straight line on the 2-D surface of the Earth, that line is curved in the 3rd dimension. So, if spacetime is curved in the 4th dimension, you could be going in a straight line 3 dimensionally, but it would be curved 4th dimensionally.\n\nHowever, one could look at it this way instead: The Universe does have a definite edge, but as ou approach that edege, you and everything else shrinks, which means you could never make it to the edge.  You wouldn't be aware of the shrinkage because even the measuring devices would be shrunk, so you would think you were going endlessly in a straight line, when in reality, you were approaching an actual finite edge, but never making it.  Again, it can never be tested, so just a thought ;0)"
"Which plant survives by drawing moisture from daily fog in namib desert?
clues:\noptions:\npalmrosa namibiensis,palmrosa mozambica,wetwitschia mirabilis,acacia nilotica,fouquieria splendens
Welwitschia mirabilis is ecologically highly specialized, and is adapted to grow under arid conditions receiving regular fog. This regular, dense fog is formed when the cold north-flowing Benguela Current meets the hot air coming off the Namib Desert.  The source I listed contains much more detailed information as well as photographs of this plant."
"12/5 rational or irrational?why?

A rational number is a real number that can be written as a ratio of two integers. 0.1 and 1/3 are rational numbers. \nNumbers that cannot be written as ratios of two integers are called irrational. The square root of 2 is not rational, and there is a cute little proof of this fact. 1/0 is not a rational number because it is not a real number. Pi (the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference) is also irrational."
"I""m looking for an open ended compression sock material which I can cut to lenght and make my own sock.?
This sock was used as an anti endemic on my leg post total hip replacement. It was really easy to put on and take off, much easier than a premade compression sock. The roll of material was long and shaped like a tube, and the therapist just cut it and taped the end and instant sock. The material was ""peach' colored
What you are describing is called Tubigrip (brand name). It comes in different sizes depending on the area which you would be treating, wrist vs. ankle vs. thigh. Your best bet to get this material would be to call the therapy place where you got it previously and ask if they will sell you another piece (at our clininic it gets charged by the inch or foot depending on length). Another option would be to go to, or call,  a health equipment store and see if they carry the Tubigrip and can sell it to you or if you can order a box from them. Good luck."

"A question about becoming a writer!?
Im 15 and I want to become both a writer and a social studies for college students. I was talking with my mom today, and she said that the first few times i will, more than likely, get my books rejected. She said that after i make 2 or 3 good books i will be well known and then they will publish all of my books.. Is this true? And also, since i want to be a social studies teacher, do you think i could do both? Just in case you want to know, i love teaching, i love social studies and i love writing.. thanks and have a good night
Sweetie, you don't become a writer - if you write, you are a writer. It isn't something you choose, it is something you feel you need to do. Now, becoming a published writer is somewhat different. You will face alot of rejection. You may have to submit your work dozens of times to even get a nibble. But even then, you may struggle for years to get more published.  It is not an easy path - but so worth it if you really want to do it.  I would suggest you write every day - something, notes, diary, short stories, poems.  The more you write, the better you will get at it.  And another tip is to watch those around you. Be a people watcher. See how they interact, how they talk, how they stand. Observe everything around you and put it down. Learn how to balance your writing with people and things.  Also, take any classes you can about writing.  You can ask your family to subscribe the magazine Writer's Digest for Christmas or your birthday. It's a great help.  And as for becoming a teacher - go for it, it's a hard but fufilling career also.  Good luck and keep your eyes on your goal."

"Forces of 5N, 4N and 3N are in equilibrium. Assuming that sin37=0.6, what is the angle between 5N and 3N force
A. 37\nB. 53\nC. 90\nD. 127\nE. 143\nMy answer came up to be 53 (B) but the real answer is D(127). How?
If you form a triangle with 5,4 and 3 as sides then the angle between 3 and 4 is 90 degree.\n\n3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 (Pythagorean numbers).\n\nGiven one angle is 37 therefore the other angle is 90 - 37 = 53. \n\nBut in the above trianglewe considered the equilibrant. \n\nThe resultant is opposite to the 5 in the triangle.\n\nHence the angle between 5 and 3 is 180 -53 = 127."
"Is all the antibacterial stuff on the market casuing our germs to become stronger?

There are a conbination of things that are creating these different strains of germs. Darwin's theory of evolution is a good explanation of one reason for the ""stronger"" germs. Antibiotics and antibacterial""stuff"" eliminates the common types of bacteria. The ones that resist are what remain and through mutation new types of bacteria are left. A lot of times these newer bacteria seem ""stronger"" because they are immune to our antibiotics. Our bodies are also not accustomed to these newer strains of bacteria. \n\nIt's not neccesarily a ""stronger"" bacteria, it's a different strain that has become immune to the antibiotics that are overused."

Since we as humans are unable to understand, why there are (two beings within our minds) the being that runs the body without having to tell it to and the part that thinks, speaks and learns, it’s all because we don’t understand what we are and why we do the things we do, so to suppress our doings we seek spirituality in hopes we live as in general as others. (the good and evil within ourselves) so we are saving ourselves from ourselves and the truth would be to find out why there are two beings in our minds (Good & Evil) however truth is whatever we believe to be truth, “so I choose to believe we are of alien descent” is the same as “I choose to believe in “any or no god of my choice and get the same type of reward because I am what I am and as a flower in the garden that attracts an insect that eat the beautiful flowers”

"Has anyone ever had tax debt settled for pennies on the dollar?

It is sometimes possible to erase your tax debt at an enormouse discount with an offer in compromise.  The IRS does not publicize this program for obvious reasons, as there have been cases to where somone has reduced their debt to around 5% (including debt and penalties.)  In order to proceed with an offer in compromise, one of the following must be true:\n1.  There is some kind of doubt as to whether the IRS can collect their debt from you.\n2.  There is some doubt as to whether or not you owe the bil.  \n\nThe IRS accepts 1 out of 4 offers in compromise, so if you seriously want to reduce your debt and get your offer accepted; you should seek the help of a tax specialist.  \n\nI do know one case where a woman in WA state had her IRS debt reduced from $20k+ to less than $1k.  There were errors on her past returns and a tax specialist was able to refile past years tax returns to reduce the debt.  It was pretty amazing to have your life turned around so quickly!"
"Why do people fall when prayed for? What's the purpose of it?
Scriptural evidence suggests people fell forward (as opposed to backwards like they do in churches today), & nobody was praying for them when they 'fell'. They were praying by themselves when it happened. Explanations?
Falling forward when you are praying by yourself still happens today, it is a form of reverence to God to lay prostrate on the ground when you speak to Him. A way of showing that you feel you are not even worthy to kneel in His presence. Falling backward in church when someone else is praying for you is know as being slain in the spirit and it isn't something you do on your own. I have experienced this particular phenomenon and it is indescribable. I didn't so much fall backward, I fell more straight down. It's as if my legs simply wouldn't hold me up anymore and I crumbled. It was the oddest feeling, but a good feeling, I could feel the presence of the Lord working in me and through me. If you've not experienced this it's hard to understand, but it does happen, it is real."

"What do you think they should name the 10th planet?
Since they discovered it last year, the 10th planet has been nicknamed ""Xena"" (as in Xena, Warrior Princess) and it's moon ""Gabrielle"" (name of Xena's sidekick on the show).  What do you think they should name this new planet (and it's moon if you're up to it), and why?  \nMy personal opinoin is ""Apollo"", but what does everyone else think it should be?  (is there a website we can suggest names to, perhaps?)
First, forget Sedna.  That is a body smaller than Pluto, and it's not the one most likely to be our 10th planet. The one discovered last year, and which is larger than Pluto, is 2003 UB313, commonly known as Xena (although that is not among the names secretly submitted to the IAU as genuine candidates if the thing becomes a planet).\n\nAll the other planets (excluding Earth) are named after Roman gods, with the exception of Uranus, named after a Greek god.  I think we should go Greek again this time ... and it's about time we had another female besides Venus.\n\nSo I propose 'Nyx' (primoridal Greek goddess of the night, and daughter of Chaos).  The Roman equivalent is 'Nox' (which by the way is where we get 'equinox', meaning ""equal-night"" ... I learned that on West Wing.)\n\nAnd for the moon, one of Nyx's many children:  Hemera (""day""), Moros (""fate"" or ""doom""), or one of the three fates (Clotho, Atropos, or Lachesis), and there are many other candidates ... she had lots of children, a few of them with her brother Erebus.  (By the way, Erebus would be another good name (as a constant companion) ... but who knows if we'll discover another moon someday."
"A farmer moves along the boundary of a square field of side 10m in 40s. (see down for the question).?
what will be the magnitude of displacement of the farmer at the end of 2 minutes 20 seconds?
displacement = final position - initial position.\nBecause the path is a square, you need two coordinates (x, y) to specify position. Besides the start poit must be specified.\n\nIf we place the rectangle over the 4th quadrant, and the farmer starts walking from the corner at point (0, 0) and moving clockwise then he will move 140 m in 140 s (2 min 20 sec)(because he moves 40 m in 40 s, speed: 1 m/s)\n\nAt the end he will move around the square 3 times and a half, it means he is in the opposite corner where he started.\nThe displacement is the diagonal of the square, that you can calculate by Pithagoras' theorem:\nD = sqrt(10² + 10²) = 14.14 m\n\nIf he starts moving from another initial position, the displacement could be different."

I have tried many diets,exercises and pills.... I lost weight but gained it back even though I stayed on them for years.\n The mind set is very important..never use the words i am aon a diet...instead say this is the type of foods that work for me.\n\n I finally found the Medeterain diet.... it is hard cheeses,lots of green veggies,fish,or chicken,extra virgin olive oil for cooking in...not much bread...olives.. both kinds...water \n I also just cut one high carb or high fat food out every 2-3 weeks... now I don't crave them anymore\n Found that not using any sugar,real or artifical (bodies don't digest it well) has halped me not get the cravings for the carbs.\n I wrote a list of when,what & why I ate each time I ate....I saw where my weaknesses were & when I gained the weight.I never weight myself...I go by how the clothes keep going downin size... treat myself to sometjing new when they start to get really loose.\n\n Rememeber one bad day is not reason to beat yourself up over...never ever tell people you are on a diet(their hounding you will cause you stress & make it harder to sick to it...and a bad day with them is hell to hear about).\n\n as for exercise I HATE it... but have found dancing to my favorite CDs is a great way to enjoy it... walking, bike riding & swimming work too. Find several things you already like to do....(.the exercise tapes only made me feel like a failure when I got bored with them... the classes...were a joke after a while,very boring).Change them everyday... and it makes it easier to stick with it.\n Keep telling yourself how great you feel each day instead of llooking at the chunky monkeys (as my son calls them).When we see only the negative parts of us we start with the negative thoughts *& words...\n When you crave something start with a cool glass of water...80% of the time people are thirsty not hungry.. wait about 20 -30 minutes,find something to keep your mind focused & hands busy .... if you still crave it... eat just a half a portion..if you try to subsitute it,you'll eat more...then eventually end up eating it anyways..which packs on the calories.... and can make you feel like a failure too\n Doing it this way & realising it was what my body needed,,,I have kept it off for 5 years...all the other ways I slowly put it back on with in a year as I got bored with them & didn't care to eat the foods anymore..we are each different & what works for some will never work for others.. You will find the right foods for you...\n Everything in moderation...also take the advice of we_gewi21...he speaks the truth about NA women & it's really how much our media has put so many  negative thought about how we should all be a size 0.... big boobs aren't the only thing men look for in a lady..(though I have them naturally).I know many guys who think I have a hot body...they all love my eyes,smile,hair & sense of humor..... it took me 3 years to trully understand why... they want a cuddly women with some softness to their bodies.....someone who is real enough to  know life is to be enjoyed.\n My fiance fell head over heels in love with me when I was  heavier.. he accepted my miind & who I was...loved the softness of my body..and what all the other guys did about me. He got a bit upset when I got down to 125 lbs... as I was 145 lbs. (when we met) he asked me to please start eating a bit more....not to get fat ..but to put some meat on my bones...lol..He is an Army medic & knows alot about the human body.... he said we each have a size & shape...never ever listen to those who say the only way to be loved is to be skinny...\n My friends& family also said I looked sickly when I weighted 125 llbs. and needed to eat.....as I looked awesome at 145 lbs.\nIt's the inside that counts the most... even a size 0 is not attractive if the heart is cold & mean.. it shows on the outside...

"What are the features of spina bifida?
IT A DISORDER
Definition\nSpina Bifida means cleft spine, which is an incomplete closure in the spinal column. In general, the three types of spina bifida (from mild to severe) are:\n\n1. Spina Bifida Occulta: There is an opening in one or more of the vertebrae (bones) of the spinal column without apparent damage to the spinal cord.\n\n2. Meningocele: The meninges, or protective covering around the spinal cord, has pushed out through the opening in the vertebrae in a sac called the ""meningocele."" However, the spinal cord remains intact. This form can be repaired with little or no damage to the nerve pathways.\n\n3. Myelomeningocele: This is the most severe form of spina bifida, in which a portion of the spinal cord itself protrudes through the back. In some cases, sacs are covered with skin; in others, tissue and nerves are exposed. Generally, people use the terms ""spina bifida"" and ""myelomeningocele"" interchangeably."

There are two kinds in general use today. One is more or less a stuff rob similar to a large pipe cleaner that is inserted into a hollow shaft surgically constructed in the penis that causes rigidity and the other is an inflatable series of tubes surgically implanted in the shaft of the penis and pumped full of fluid by a pump. The pump mechanism can be inside or outside the body and has a relief valve to detumesce the erection."

That is correct. I hope you didn't find that out for the first time here on Yahoo Answers! That would be awful.\n\nTwo type A parents can only have type A or type O children.\n\nSince you are AB, one of your true biological parents would have type B or type AB blood. That's the only way you could have inherited a B allele to give you type AB blood."
"What is the difference between a white object and a mirror?
The color white is percieved because an object reflects all the visible wavelengths.  A mirror does this same thing.  How do we percieve them as different? Or am I misinformed?
A white object spreads the light into many directions. A mirror doesn't, it instead keeps the light focused, which is why we can see our images."
"what is Doppler Effect?

It is a shift in the perceived frequency of waves by a receiver (or transmitter) in motion.  Also called the Doppler Shift.\n\nFor instance, If you were standing on the beach and for this experiments purpose, waves come in every 20 seconds.  If you walk closer to the sea, the waves hitting you occur less than 20 seconds because you are shortening the gap.  As you walk to shore, the frequency is more than 20 seconds.  If you stop, the frequency again returns to 20 seconds.\n\nSee link for better answer.  And learn how to use google.  The link below was the first response in google."

"Is Now The Right Time To Sell My House Or Should I Wait till After Xmas??
I am considering selling my house, should i do it now or should i wait untill after xmas??
Irrespective of Christmas, there will always be people looking for a house. The whole world doesn't stop for Christmas - even if the shops/media like to think it does. You could try putting it on the market to get a feel of things. If you don't like it, you can always take your property off the market and put it back on sometime in the new year. It also depends on how marketable your property is. If your property/area is in huge demand then someone will come along.\n\nIf I was looking for a property, I wouldn't stop just because its Christmas. The only problem is that solicitors etc. break up for a fortnight at Christmas so it will slow down the sale process."

"why are there people who can see dead people or who are possesed by demons and ghosts?

We are sensitive to things that other people may ignore.\nI have not seen dead people but I have certainly spoken with some. I think many people could do this if they would be alone without distractions and have the feeling like they would like to do this. There are a great many spirits that would love to communicate with loved ones on this side.\nIt is just a feeling like I am aware of things that can't be seen. Spirits are attracted to me for my ability to sense things that are sort of just on the other side of the ""curtain."" I am just not into things in this world as much as I am in the other world for some reason.\nPeople who are possessed are those who are doing things that are bad and in a way welcome demons into their bodies.\nThey don't welcome demons deliberately, but when you use drugs, drink to excess, or do certain thihngs to your body that alters it in negative ways, in other words you do negative destructive things deliberatley, you break the delicate shell that protects you and deomns then can entr your body and subtly exercise control over you."

"what is coriols force?

Once air has been set in motion by the pressure gradient force, it undergoes an apparent deflection from its path, as seen by an observer on the earth. This apparent deflection is called the ""Coriolis force"" and is a result of the earth's rotation.\n\nAs air moves from high to low pressure in the northern hemisphere, it is deflected to the right by the Coriolis force. In the southern hemisphere, air moving from high to low pressure is deflected to the left by the Coriolis force.\n\nThe amount of deflection the air makes is directly related to both the speed at which the air is moving and its latitude. Therefore, slowly blowing winds will be deflected only a small amount, while stronger winds will be deflected more. Likewise, winds blowing closer to the poles will be deflected more than winds at the same speed closer to the equator. The Coriolis force is zero right at the equator.\n\nThis process is further demonstrated by the movie link below. \n\nQuicktime: http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fw/gifs/coriolis.mov\n\nMPEG\nhttp://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fw/gifs/coriolis.mpg\n\nThis USA Today website also provides and outstandign explanation and some really good links to further explanations\n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/basics/coriolis-understanding.htm"

Quite a lot, unfortunately...\n\nTo design games for general release, you definitely need to be part of a large development/publishing house. To get in, you'll need skills in programming/engineering and/or design. And you'l need qualifications in these.\n\nSome institutions are now offering courses specifially targeted at training game designers, otherwise your best bet is to take software engineering or something similar, or 3d design etc etc.\n\nOr, if you're alreayd an ace at either of the two, make a demo program of some kind and send it in for companies to look at. Be careful - copyright everything and make it clear you are not submitting suggestions but seeking employment based on your skills and telents.\n\nStart by checking who developed and published your facuorite games- look them up on the net and see if their sites have a ""jobs"" or employment"" section.

"What is thyroiditis and how is it treated?

This going to be a long post but will answer the bulk of your questions. Hope it helps. This is taken from a powerpoint lecture on Thyroiditis so the formatting may be off.\n\nThyroiditis\n\nInflammation of the Thyroid Gland\n  \n\nThyroiditis is an inflammation (not an infection) of the thyroid gland. Several types of thyroiditis exist and the treatment is different for each.\n\n\nHashimoto's Thyroiditis. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (also called autoimmune or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is the most common type of thyroiditis. It is named after the Japanese physician, Hakaru Hashimoto, that first described it in 1912. The thyroid gland is always enlarged, although only one side may be enlarged enough to feel. During the course of this disease, the cells of the thyroid becomes inefficient in converting iodine into thyroid hormone and ""compensates"" by enlarging (for a review of this process see our function page). The radioactive iodine uptake may be paradoxically high while the patient is hypothyroid because the gland retains the ability to take-up or ""trap"" iodine even after it has lost its ability to produce thyroid hormone. As the disease progresses, the TSH increases since the pituitary is trying to induce the thyroid to make more hormone, the T4 falls since the thyroid can't make it, and the patient becomes hypothyroid. The sequence of events can occur over a relatively short span of a few weeks or may take several years.\n\nTreatment is to start thyroid hormone replacement. This prevents or corrects the hypothyroidism and it also generally keeps the gland from getting larger.\n\nIn most cases the thyroid gland will decrease in size once thyroid hormone replacement is started.\n\nThyroid antibodies are present in 95% of patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and serve as a useful ""marker"" in identifying the disease without thyroid biopsy or surgery.\n\nThyroid antibodies may remain for years after the disease has been adequately treated and the patient is on thyroid hormone replacement.\n\n\nDe Quervain's Thyroiditis. De Quervain's Thyroiditis (also called subacute or granulomatous thyroiditis) was first described in 1904 and is much less common than Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. The thyroid gland generally swells rapidly and is very painful and tender. The gland discharges thyroid hormone into the blood and the patients become hyperthyroid; however the gland quits taking up iodine (radioactive iodine uptake is very low) and the hyperthyroidism generally resolves over the next several weeks.\n\nPatients frequently become ill with fever and prefer to be in bed.\n\nThyroid antibodies are not present in the blood, but the sedimentation rate, which measures inflammation, is very high.\n\nAlthough this type of thyroiditis resembles an infection within the thyroid gland, no infectious agent has ever been identified and antibiotics are of no use.\n\nTreatment is usually bed rest and aspirin to reduce inflammation.\n\nOccasionally cortisone (steroids) (to reduce inflammation) and thyroid hormone (to ""rest"" the thyroid gland) may be used in prolonged cases.\n\nNearly all patients recover and the thyroid gland returns to normal after several weeks or months.\n\nA few patients will become hypothyroid once the inflammation settles down and therefore will need to stay on thyroid hormone replacement indefinitely.\n\nRecurrences are uncommon.\n\n\nSilent Thyroiditis. Silent Thyroiditis is the third and least common type of thyroiditis. It was not recognized until the 1970's although it probably existed and was treated as Graves' Disease before that. This type of thyroiditis resembles in part Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and in part De Quervain's Thyroiditis. The blood thyroid test are high and the radioactive iodine uptake is low (like De Quervain's Thyroiditis), but there is no pain and needle biopsy resembles Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.

It is a normal feeling. It is likely due to the MANIC side of being Bi-Polar and the restlessness that comes with it. You should try not to give into it though, you have to work through it and ""put it away.""  That is part of learning to handle the condition.  It would be good to let a therapist know about it if you are seeing one.  Gl and stay strong!"

"How can we Predict Tsunami?

Very pertinent.  If you live on the Pacific Ocean, you can check the two tsunami information web sites below.  Besides current warnings they have lots of information on tsunami and earthquakes in general.  That said, tsunami prediction is very imprecise.  In my town, Crescent City, California, we had a tsunami last week as a result of the earthquake north of Japan.  The prediction center had issued an ""all clear"", then later rescinded it.  At the predicted time, a small wave of only a few inches occurred, but two hours later a six foot wave caused nearly one million dollars damage to the harbor.\n\nA major problem with tsunami prediction is that many big waves are caused by underwater landslides, events that may not require a large quake to happen.  Additionally, local factors can have a great effect, increasing or decreasing the size of waves.\n\nIf you are in a tsunami zone and you feel the earth move, IMMEDIATELY move to the highest ground possible, preferably on foot as often roads become clogged.  Even if a quake is close at hand you may have several minutes to get away.  Often people have hours to prepare, and after our experience the other day I will always just assume the worst.  The Tsunami Warning Center is on my ""favorites"" list in my browser, but after the events of last week my faith has been shaken."
"Is it ever OK for women to urinate in public?
Is it ever OK for women to pee in public? Or is public urination only OK for men, and never appropriate for ladies? If a woman needs to urinate and cannot find a restroom is it ever OK for her to pee outside, or should she just hold it in, no matter how long she has to wait or how badly she needs to relieve herself? And if it's not OK for women to urinate in public, is it OK for men?
Well, urinating in public, if that is the only option and as long as it is in a discreet place in public ie. behind a tree or building out of the way of direct view, seems fine to me.  Think about it: the main purpose of anyone urinating in public is to immediately relieve the bladder in a dire situation such as no available bathroom  This can happen to either men or women.  Would you rather your girl find a discreet public place to pee or do it on herself?  Its a no-brainer.\n\nThe boxes that we put each other in based on sex are so small.  They actually make good places to pee in."

"g(x)= sqrt. 5-X  Find Domain and show in Interval Notation?

Domain (D):\nx can be any real number except any x that causes the radicand (expression inside the radical symbol) to be negative. Also, any x that causes division by zero is out of the domain. So, we can immediately throw out x = 1.\n\nx + 5\n――– ≥ 0\nx - 1\n\nSo, how do you figure out when the fraction is positive or negative? One way is to make a chart. Values of interest include x = -5 and x = 1. Let's look at the entire real number line...\n\n-∞ ←――――――― -5 ―――――1 ―――――→ +∞\n\nx+5→- - - - - - - - - - - - 0 + + + + + + + + + + + + +\n\nx-1 →- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 0+ + + + + + +\n\nx + 5\n――– →+ + + + + + + 0 - - - - - - - - ∞+ + + + + + +\nx - 1\n\nTherefore, it appears that your radicand is non-negative from negative infinity up to and including -5. Also, from 1 to positive infinity the radicand is non-negative. However, as mentioned earlier, bad things happen at +1 so we'll exclude +1. So, in interval notation, your domain is given by the following:\nD = (-∞, -5] U (1, ∞).\n\nRange (R):\nWhen you take the square root of a non-negative number, you get a non-negative number. Notice that your radicand will never equal 1. There is a rule for determining this. It has something to do with (ax+b)/(cx+d)→a/c as x→±∞. You'll need to look that up in your textbook or discover it on your own by thinking about it. \n\nTherefore, R = [0, 1) U (1, +∞)."

"If you have hep C and get a woman pregnant will the baby have hep C?

The hepatitis C virus is NOT transmitted from the father to the baby, but it can be transmitted from the mother to the baby.  However, the transmission of HCV from mother to child is relatively low, about 5% of babies born to HCV-infected women get the virus.  If the mother has HIV and HCV, then the risk is higher, between 10-15%.\n\nThe risk of transmitting HCV sexually between monagamous male and female partners is low (less then 5%)."
"why are muslims supposed to lie to non muslims?
an arabic speaker who knows the koran recently wrote here that muslims are instructed to lie to non muslims any time it furthers the interests of the muslim community. I have seen this stated before as being in the koran. Doesn't this make it almost impossible for non muslims to beleive anything muslims say about trying to get along, etc.? If not, why not?
Sura.5:51 disdains the Jews. Mohammed said, “The last hour will not come before the Muslims fight the Jews, and the Muslims kill them.” (Mishkat Al Masabih Sh.M. Ashraf pp.147, 721, 810-11, 1130).\n\nIslam divides the world into dar al-Islam (the house of peace) and dar al-Harb (the house of war). To bring ""peace,"" Allah commands, ""I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads! (8:13); Slay the idolaters wherever you find them...(9:5); O Prophet, struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites and be thou harsh with them...(9:73); Believers, make war on the infidels that dwell around you..."" (9:123). Perpetual jihad is commanded until all the world is under sharia. Nor would that bring peace, because Muslims fight among themselves, as history testifies.\n\nI see  Poki Poki, says:  ""Show me a verse that tells muslims to lie"".\n\nWhen allah casts terrors in their hearts of nonmuslim, what is this?  Terror is what?  LIES.\n\n."
"do u believe  that universe is expanding !! if it is expanding where is it expanding ...?

It's expanding but it's also self-contained--much like the surface of a baloon as it expands. To creatures on the surface of a balloon it would be meaningless to ask what the balloon is ""expanding into"" because the surface of a balloon is contiguos in 3 (2 space 1 time) dimensions much like the universe in contiguous in 4 dimensions (3 space 1 time)"

"what is implantation bleeding how bad can it be and how long can it last?

Implantation usually occours about LP8-9 (8-9 days after ovulation). It is a minor spotting or blood tinged discharge that occours when the fertilized egg (zygote) embeds into the uterine lining. Not all women experience this. You should have no more bleeding than you might have with Ovulatory spotting."
"Why do we have pubic hair? What is its purpose? Thanks!?

in our caveman days it served several purposes. first it helped to protect the genitals from dirt and other elements, in guys it would also help to keep the are warm. sperm need a certain temperature to stay alive, if it gets too cold they die. also the hair would help to hold the smell. gross nowadays but back then the smell was what people were attracted to, there's a lot of pheromones in sweat."

"How do you ask family members to not bring their dogs that they take with them everywhere?
It will be my child's bday soon and I want everyone minus their dogs to come.  My husband's dog gets upset and snappy (he's a big dog) when other dogs come around and our house is just too small for all those people and their dogs.  I don't want them dragging in dirt and knocking down my child, either.  I KNOW at least one person will be offended.  How do I minimize this without getting into long explanations that won't help anyway?
Just tell everyone.  Be honest and up front.  Say that your dog gets too upset and your place is too small.  Let people know that if they do bring their dogs they are to be tied up out side.  Don't mention the part about the dirt and house work.  But be firm and make your point known in no uncertain terms.  Be sure that everyone in your household will back you on this - or don't even bother trying.\n\nNow stick to your guns.  Don't allow any dogs in to your house.  Have some rope and leashes available in case some one brings a dog.   Also have a few water bowls handy.\n\nIf you are going to do this - be sure that your own dog is kept out of the way for the duration of the get together.  \n\nSome people may not show up over this.  You must be willing to risk that."

of the ash from a corn burning heater?
The second poster does not know the difference between CO, carbon monoxide, and CO2, carbon dioxide.\n\nDid you mean coal or corn?  If you meant corn, as in corn cobs, the ash is mainly anhydrous potassium carbonates, oxides, and other potassium salts.  It is commonly called potash, literally ""potassium ash"".  If it is heated to a very high temperature the carbonate decomposes, giving off carbon dioxide gas and leaving ""caustic potash"", potassium hydroxide.\n\nOur ancestors used potash to make hard bars of soap when it is mixed with fat, stearic acid.  Soft soap that doesn't harden into bars is made with sodium salts."

"Does it hurt the first time?
Yeah, my boyfriend wants to try anal but i heard people say it hurts heaps..does it?
Everybody's different, I don't personally know of any women who like it, only my gay male friends. I think that the anus should have a sign that says ""Exit Only"".  If you have a vagina you don't need to use an anus for intercourse.\n\nDoes your boyfriend have gay tendencies? Or is he just overly influenced by media suggesting that he put it there?\n\nI have heard stories of people ending up not being able to control their bowels because of muscle damage.\n\nIf you decide to try it make sure to have sexual lubricant on hand to reduce the pain.  KY jelly or generic brands work, and can be used for vaginal sex.  Don't use other types of lotions as they really aren't good for sexual activity.\n\nMost important, if you do do it, use a condom.  Diseases can easily be spread by anal intercourse.  Never go from anus to vagina as bacteria can be introduced that cause yeast and other diseases."
"If I dig a whole all the way through the earth and jump in it what effect  does gravity have?

Ok well lets assume that we are not taking pressure or temperature into account, nor friction due to to air speed etc. If you jumped in the hole you would fall, and continue falling at greater and greater speed. Now as you approach the center of the earth the force of gravity would decrease  but  momentum would keep you going right thru the center and  towards the other side.\nNow gravity would start to increase again as you get farther from the center, but it would tend to start slowing you down. until it caused you to stop, right about the other side of the hole in the earth. Think of a bungee jumper, same thing. Now if you were not able to hold on to something you would start falling back down the hole and it would repeat.\n\nOf course this is a VERY simplified view of what would happen. In reality  you have things like the rotation of the earth th consider, which would cause you not to fall straight down the hole, but into the side wall of the hole. But it is a good thought experiment to help understand gravity."

A train station bell gives off a fundamental tone of 500 Hz as the train approaches the station at a speed of 20 m/s. If the speed of sound in air is 335 m/s, what will be the apparent frequency of the bell to an observer riding the train?\n\nMy issue with this problem was that if the observer is RIDING the train, won't the frequency be the same? Or am I reading the question wrong?
You are correct that if the bell and passenger are both on the train then the freq would be the same.  But, I think the intent of this question is to say that the bell is on the station.  It says 'train station bell'.  Since the bell is on the station and the person is on the train, there is a relative motion between them."

Depends on your risk/investment profile. Lowest risk and lowest return: CDs. Highest risk and highest return: stocks, real estate, (some) business franchises (e.g. restaurants). Somewhere in the middle are mutual funds which many believe to be the best combination of risk/return; there are a variety of funds for every investment profile, so-called index funds (tracking the broad market trends and thus fairly safe) would be my recommendation.

"What is Market Skimming?

Market Skimming as a Strategy for Introduction \n \nSeveral general strategies are available for introducing new products. One of the most common strategies is market skimming. When employing a skimming strategy, a high price is set for the product’s introduction and is generally accompanied by heavy promotional spending. Because of the high price employed, the product typically is positioned to innovators and early adopters. Of course, an assumption underlying the use of skimming is that the market is price inelastic and will be attracted to the unique characteristics of the innovation.  \n\nIn general, the product is promoted to emphasize its unique characteristics that make it attractive to innovators and early adopters.  Typically, products are promoted as unique, fashion-orientated, prestigious or very high in quality.  \n\nSkimming is a particularly attractive strategy when marketers face high investments in research and development, or production and other marketing related start-up costs are high. Setting a high price for the product helps recover these costs quickly.  Skimming is also particularly attractive when the potential effects of competition can be minimized. This means that competitive entry can be forestalled, or delayed, because of patents, high investment costs, and customer preferences for particular brands. \n\nSony's Digital Camera\n \nA recent example of market skimming is provided by Sony’s Digital Mavica Camera. Introduced in 1997, this camera is targeted to innovators and early adopters of photographic and computer equipment. The camera was priced high, at around eight hundred dollars per unit. It was distributed in camera, computer, and electronics specialty stores. The camera was promoted heavily in print and electronic media targeted specifically to initial adopters. Little television and radio advertising was employed. Similarly, little use of sales promotions, such as coupons and rebates were used to support the initial launch."
"Could Pagans actually go to hell?
A Pagan in Hell\nBy: Pendragon\nPosted: Sept. 12th/00\nWebsite: http://www.paganvillages.com/Goddess/pendragon/index0.html\n\n\nA Pagan dies and, to his great surprise, he finds himself standing before some pearly gates. St. Peter asks him, ""May I help you?"" \n\nThe Pagan asks, ""Where am I?"" \n\nPeter says, ""You're at the gates of heaven."" \n\nThe Pagan says, ""But I don't believe in heaven."" \n\nPeter frowns at him. ""You're one of those Pagans, aren't you?"" \n\n""Yes. I believe I'm in the wrong place; I'm supposed to go to Summerland."" \n\nPeter says, ""Sorry. We took over Summerland, and it's temporarily closed for remodeling."" \n\n""What should I do now?"" \n\nPeter says, ""Well, since we don't allow Pagans in heaven, you have to go to hell. Sorry. Just follow that path that leads downward and to the left."" \n\nThe Pagan walks down to hell, where the gates are standing open. He walks in and finds beautiful meadows, happy animals, and clear streams of water. \n\nHe walks on in and begins exploring, and after a few minutes a courtly gentleman walks up to him and bows politely. ""Hello, I'm Satan. You must be the guy that St. Peter phoned me about. Are you a Pagan?"" \n\n""Yes, I am. What's going to happen now?"" \n\nSatan says, ""Well, the fishing's pretty good, if you enjoy that sort of thing. There's a little refreshment stand down the road. And I believe the Pagan meeting grounds are right over the next hill."" \n\nSuddenly, a hole opens up in the sky above, and a yawning chasm opens directly underneath it. The stench of sulphur fills the air. Hundreds of screaming, tortured souls drop down into the flaming pit, which immediately closes up with a thud. \n\nThe Pagan, hardly believing what he just saw, asks Satan, ""And what was THAT ???"" \n\nSatan rolls his eyes. ""Oh, just ignore them. They're Christians; they wouldn't have it any other way."" \n\n\n\n\nPrint this page \n\n\nCopyright Info: All articles by Keitha may be copied, posted, printed, distributed, reprinted, and linked to as long as the text is not changed, money is not earned, full credit is given to Keitha at www.glasstemple.com, and this notice is attached.\n\nFor all other uses, please contact me\n\n© 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 2005 2006 Keitha. \nAll Other Rights Reserved.\n \nAll original content, including articles, layout, images, and text Copyright Keitha (FireWind), 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 2005 2006\nwww.glasstemple.com

Is there a listing of companies who have recently went 'public' in selling shares of their company? (like from the SEC or something?) \n\nI understand that once a company's stock is 'talked about', or listed on a top 25 'up and coming' list, it may be a good buy for a while- but the big winners are those who knew about it before hand. Although people will jump on the bandwagon and make some money off of the hype, the value can become over-inflated to some degree (and not as profitable for the short term) \n\nSo, before I rattle on and confuse myself (and others) more-- my question is: \n\nHow can you find companies (or listing of) that have recently decided to sell shares  to the public??    \n\nmy thinking is that not everyone makes the news, and there has to be some central location for that information...wouldnt there?\n\nthanks

"My mom has a new baby and I have a new brother. What is the best savings plan I can set him up with as a gift?
Would a savings account in a CD, Index, or Money Market fund be better than say a Coverdell savings account? I wish I could start investing at the ripe age of 2 months but since I can't go back, I'd like to give him an opportunity to do something I couldn't when I was a little squirt.
An ESA account is only good to use for schooling.  Do you know he is going to college?  If that is what you want then go for it.  But a regular account is better since there will be a chunk of money to do whatever he (or you) see fit.  Will you be contributing money on a monthly basis or is it one time only?  If you want safety, then a money market.  Otherwise for more risk maybe a balanced fund (Vanguard Wellesley) or even a simple index fund with low expenses (like the vanguard 500 index)."
"why does paper become yellow as time passes?

the color change that paper undergoes overtime can be traced to the substances that make up its raw materials. since paper comes from trees, you can expect that it contains cellulose, or the complex carbohydrate (polysaccharride) and the polymer which cements the cellulose molecules together, lignin. lignin is a complex carbohydrate which makes tree trunks and branches sturdy and hard. \n\nthe exposure of lignin to sunlight and air is what turns the paper yellow. when lignin oxidizes it begins to become more and more unstable. it then absorbs more light which in turn causes lignin to emit a darker color."
"How do I overcome insomnia with depression at 5:45 AM?
I just want to sleep!  At least when I'm asleep I'm not so aware of how yucky and depressed I feel.  But I can't sleep.  I'm just miserable.  Any ideas?
Breathing is great.  Inhale four counts, hold seven counts, exhale eight counts.  Repeat up to eight times.\n\nDrink plenty of water during the day.  If you don't get enough water, your liver can't function properly and will keep you awake between 1 and 3 AM.  If you have acid reflux or chest congestion and don't realize it, you may unconsciously be keeping yourself awake.  Don't eat too much or too close to bedtime.\n\nAvoid foods with MSG or nitrites/nitrates or BHA/BHT.  These can trigger migraines and can cause insomnia.\n\nDo something to get tired during the day.  Exercise (even just walking 20 minutes a day) helps increase endorphins (which make you feel good) and help regulate sleep.\n\nTurn off the computer and dim the lights an hour or so before bed.  Your body needs it to be at least moderately dark to get sleepy.\n\nThere's something about taking a shower.  I think you're supposed to alternate hot and cold water, but I can't remember which one you are supposed to end with.  Something about that is supposed to make you sleepy.\n\nWarm milk or ""Sleepy Time"" tea by Celestial Seasonings might help you relax.  Make sure you are getting enough calcium and magnesium before bed time.  Taking them about an hour after your evening meal (if you take them sooner they could interfere with digestion) may help you sleep.\n\nAlso track your cycle and note when you have sleep disturbances.  If you are over-estrogenic and don't have enough progesterone that could cause sleeplessness.\n\nJournaling might help.  Go ahead and write down all those thoughts that won't let you rest.  If you have them written down, maybe your mind will let them go for a while.\n\nPrayer is also really good. Give your anxieties to Someone you can trust.\n\nIt's better to lie in bed and relax than to get up and do anything that stimulates your brain further.\n\nOh!  While you are lying in bed, start with your toes.  Tell them to relax.  Work your way up your body all the way to your scalp.  Tell yourself to relax and your body will relax.  Great way to fall asleep."
"How can I stop going back to the weight I used to have?
I was 86kg and now I am 70kg but something I eat a lot.
You should never go back to the way you used to eat when you hit the 80's... You have to stick to the system you followed to lose weight. I do that, I was 70 and now I linger between 49 and 53.. when I eat more (or fattening food) I go up to the 52-53 & I FREAK OUT and realize I should watch it.. I go back down to a 48-49...\nIts a lifelong battle coz WE (people who were bigger & lose weight) are always prone to gaining it all back if we dont take every bite into account.\nIts difficult but it will become your lifestyle & you'll get used to it.. \nRight now even Im in my ""bad"" phase (up to 52) and Im working on getting back down... it happens but YOU LIMIT IT.\nBut never think that all the celebrities who are all thin & gorgeous get there by eating doughnuts & pasta everyday =)\nGood luck"
"Pls tell me something about this illiment DIEBITES. what are it causes ,precuation and treatment. Is it cure.?

There are several causes for diabetes, but mostly the condition is caused by heredity (meaning your family history of the condition, etc.). There are different types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetics do not produce any insulin at all and are forced to use synthetic insulin injections on a daily basis to control their blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetics usually do produce insulin, but their bodies reject the insulin or the amount produced is not enough. Type 2 diabetes is usually treated with diet, exercise, and oral medications. However, some Type 2 diabetics due require insulin injections as well. \n\nPrecautions and / or preventative measures that you can take to lower your risk for developing diabetes include:\n-- Eat a well-balanced healthy diet. Limit your carb and sugar intake as much as possible. \n-- Maintain a healthy weight for your body type. Being overweight increases your risk for diabetes. \n-- Maintain healthy cholesterol and lipid / triglyceride levels. \n-- Exercise on a daily basis. Physical activity will lower your weight, cholesterol, and other factors relating to the risk of developing diabetes.\n\nTalk to your doctor about a prevention plan unique to you. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for diabetes at this point. There are excellent treatment options available and most people who are medically treated, live happy, healthy lives. \n\nGood luck and best wishes..."

I am not a doctor...\n\nYou might try getting a King Size bed.  (A ""California King"" is the roomiest).\n\nAlso, because you are ""recently married"", I suggest that you give it time -- you'll get accustomed to sleeping with someone else near you and then you'll find it uncomfortable to sleep without her there.  Give it time.\n\nTo sleep better, meanwhile, you might try some exercise (to make it harder to stay awake at night); chamomile tea (relaxant); Kava Kava or Valerian Root (herbs that induce sleep)."

wat do u do if ur parents teases u because if ur grade on pupose and think they r all right?
I am sorry, I didn't quite understand your question. Could you add a little more detail. I know your parents are teasing you but I am not sure what about. This is only a guess since I didn't understand the question is if someone teases you, just don't react and that takes their power away to get to you. Another thing you can do is to join in on the teasing of yourself and by doing that, it also takes their power away. For example if someone says you are fat....and you say, yes, I sure am....where do they go from there?  No where. I, personally, when teased have always done just what I mentioned....if someone says Boy, you sure goofed up big, didn't you.....I say, wow, your not kidding....I think I rate the biggest goof up award......see what I mean...? What can they really say after that....Nothing....Hope I helped you a bit."
"how did crowns and crowning begin?

Well if your are talking about teeth:\n\nThe earliest record of crown work is from the etruscans over 2500 years ago.after that, crowns disappered until the 1700s. During that time period, the work done was a bit crude due to the absence of goodmaterials.  Typical materials used were from animal or human teeth and held inplace by metal pivots. \nThe 1800s brought changes in crown restoration.  Porcelain began being used andsome crowns used a gold cap fitted over the root. As new machines were invented, they allowed forfaster and more accurate tooth preparation. Improvement during the 1900’s was largely due to the advancement of metal castingtechnology and the creation of an adjustable detached-post crown. Today, crowns are comfortable and can be created in a shade similar to your own teeth.\n\nIf you are talking about royalty and their crowns:\n\nRoyalty in ancient Egypt wore crowns that connected them to the gods. In almost every artistic depiction of the gods, the gods can be seen wearing a crown that identifies them with some sort of aspect of nature or power. When a king or a queen wore a crown that was similar to the depicted crown of the deity, they were connecting themselves with power and the protection of that god or goddess. Kings, queens, and princesses also wore crowns that identified their rank and function, while also enhancing the wearer's appearance and status by association with precious materials and by making the wearer to appear physically taller. A very limited selection of archaeological examples of crowns has survived into modern times. These examples include only circlets and some kerchiefs. The circlets were crafted from gold, silver, and gemstones. Thus precious materials worn by the deities and the royal family enhanced and demonstrated their high status. Moreover, precious materials associated royalty with the divine. Gods, in Egyptian belief, had skin made from gold. Thus the addition of a gold element to a human's headgear suggested a close connection with the divine. Additionally, reliefs and sculpture portray royal and divine crowns that were very tall."
"I don't seem to understand what role does the speed of light have in e=mc2 can anybody help?
I just cant seem to find the relationship between the energy a certain amount of mass has in relation with the constant of the speed of light...
The equation was a result of the mathematics involved in explaining the Special Theory of Relativity.  \n\nAfter the theory was published, a mother and son team of physicists (sorry but I forget their names), were performing fission experiments.  Fermi was the first to have performed a sustained chain reaction.  When this team split an atomic nucleus, they found that the parts left over after the split did not add up mass or matter-wise to the mass of the original atomic nucleus.  Where did this mass go?  It was converted into energy.  Energy and matter are transmutable.  At what rate does matter convert into energy in a fission  reaction?  c^2\nEnergy [E] is equal to mass [m] * the speed of light [c] squared."

"How can I find a grant for a volunteer fire department?
One of our local volunteer fire departments in the county lost their firehouse & much of their fire-fighting equipment in the recent tornado that hit their community. We are looking into grants that would be available for rebuilding their firehouse and replacing equipment for fire & rescue. The community was hard hit by the tornado and we need the firehouse to be present in this area, as it covers roughing 65 square miles and a population of roughing 800 people, with the next nearest volunteer fire dept. several miles away.
Rather than worrying about grants, are you doing billing?  I work for www.revenue-rescue.com, and what we do is recover the response costs for fire departments.  Our collection rate is about 29 cents on the dollar being recovered for fire departments, which is about half the EMS billing collection rates, but still a more efficient use of the department's time and efforts resources than grantwriting, and certainly a great complement to any alternative sources of funding.

"why the carbonyl double bond have a dipole while the carbon - carbon double bond does not have?

The carbonyl double bond is between atoms of different electronegativity, resulting in an electron deficite at the weaker atom (C) and a surplus at the stronger atom (O) along the bond.\n\nStill, the carbon-carbon double bond also does create a dipol (or rather quadrupol) moment:\n\nThe carbon and all other bonded atoms lie in a plane. The double bond electrons are distributed: 2 to the direct bond between the atoms, 2 to the overlapping P-orbitals. This creates a slight electron deficite in the plane of the bond and a slight electron surplus above and below, which is what makes double bonds more reactive than single bonds."

"does melatonin help to cure lung cancer?

In 1992, the Life Extension Foundation introduced a melatonin supplement because of the broad-spectrum protective effects that this hormone had shown against age-related disease.1 Some of this research even suggested that melatonin supplementation may extend the human life span.2 Indeed, melatonin is so intricately involved in cell regulatory processes that scientists are now studying it as an adjunctive cancer treatment.3,4\n\n \nThese days, most people are likely to associate melatonin with a hormone that helps people sleep better or prevents jet lag.5,6 Few people realize that melatonin is a cancer-killing hormone7,8 that can enhance the human immune system,9,10 protect against the toxic side effects of chemotherapy4,11 and radiation therapy,12,13 and improve wound healing after cancer surgery.14,15 Even fewer are aware of ongoing clinical trials in which melatonin is being used to help cancer patients better manage their disease symptoms,16 improve their quality of life,17 and even increase their survival rates.4,11\n\nAlthough the evidence demonstrating melatonin’s anti-cancer effects18 cannot be overstated, melatonin’s impact on cancer treatment remains largely unappreciated. This is likely because pharmaceutical companies have little to gain by advertising the anticancer efficacy of melatonin. In Europe, where melatonin is not even readily available, many clinical trials of melatonin have been conducted.19,20 US pharmaceutical companies, however, have shown little interest in even hosting, let alone funding, such critically important and potentially lifesaving clinical trials.\n\nLife Extension Supports Clinical Trial\nThe Life Extension Foundation is collaborating with Cancer Treatment Centers of America on the first prospective, randomized clinical trial utilizing melatonin in patients with advanced lung cancer. Life Extension is providing, at no charge, high-dose melatonin and placebo supplements for this ongoing clinical trial, which will be the first in the US to examine the effect of melatonin supplementation therapy on quality of life and overall survival rates for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n \nFigure 1. Structure of Melatonin (C13H16N2O2)\n \nLife Extension and the Cancer Treatment Centers of America hope to determine whether patients with advanced lung cancer suffer abnormal circadian rhythms and whether this affects their melatonin levels. The researchers hope that this trial will confirm the favorable clinical results documented by Lissoni and colleagues, whose recent European clinical studies indicate that in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, five-year survival and overall tumor regression rates were higher in patients concomitantly treated with melatonin than in those treated with chemotherapy alone.4 While no patient treated with chemotherapy survived after two years, five-year survival was achieved in 3 of 49 patients treated with chemotherapy and melatonin. The researchers hope that similarly promising results could eventually convince mainstream medical practitioners to administer melatonin in combination with standard cancer treatment regimens to patients in earlier stages of cancer treatment.\n\nNumerous, mostly European clinical studies already have examined melatonin’s therapeutic benefits to patients with different types of cancer who either did not respond to standard oncological therapies11,19 or were eligible only for supportive care (advanced cancer deemed untreatable by conventional standards).21,22 A literature search of the PubMed database found 806 publications on “melatonin and cancer.” Fifty-two articles were found concerning clinical studies utilizing melatonin in cancer patients. In this article, we will highlight and summarize some of the key studies concerning the use and mechanisms of melatonin as an adjuvant cancer therapy.\n\nWhat Is Melatonin?\nMelatonin (known scientifically as the indoleamine N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine)"

It depends on where you are doing the experiment. It is a universal law that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field regardless of their mass thus reaching the ground together if they are released from the same height but things like air resistance may change things dramatically causing the feather to fall much more slowly than for example hammer."

"Christians and Non-believers: Are you tired of being judged?
Do you feel like you are being judged on this board without anyone having any knowledge of you? I have seen countless Christians on this board answering questions with tolerance and love, and MANY posts by non-christians saying that all Christians are mean, and forceful, and hypocritical. If people really want to know about something, and they are reading posts answered with tolerance and love, why cant they atleast cut it down to some Christians, and not all, as many here have proved to be an example that not all of us are forceful rude, or trying to convert non-believers?\nDont let a few bad appleas ruin the bunch. I'm so tired of being lumped in with the hard core religious right. Why cant non-believers just admit they only have knowledge of what SOME christians are like and stop generalizing? \n\nOn the other hand, as some  Christians do, why cant they stop telling non-believers they are hopless, and lost, and confused? Thats not going to prove anything to anyone.
Actually, it's worth it.\n\nI divide this section into two different categories. The good people and the bad people. Both good and bad people come from both sides. Christians/Muslims as well as Atheists.\n\nThe good people wanna spread love, the bad people wanna spread hatred.\n\nThe good people can see right through all the silly insults and judgemental opinions. The bad people can't see that, and they continue spreading hatred.\n\nIf the good people just step over the insults, and continue spreading the message of Love, then in the end we (the good people) will always win. Even if we convert one person from the bad to the good side, then our visit to this forum was succesfull.\n\nTrust me, we really are bigger than a few insults :)"

That's the best idea, keep them at home.  We did as long as we could.\nHowever, its more difficult that you think. Most people in this culture work outside the home. In other cultures they do not. We have a lot here because we work all the time.  You can not care for an elderly person if you are not there.

"is it possible that EDTA,Ca+ chelating agent and Ca+ have positive effect on enzyme activity?
I am working with pure glucosidase enzymes, during the chractersitic study of this enzyme i found that this enzyme shows positive effect towards Ca+ and EDTA. It is quite surprising for me because EDTA is a Ca chelating agent and if EDTA added to the reaction mixture it should bind to the Ca and decrease the enzyme activity but it does not show that. Any body could tell me that is it possible that both EDTA and Ca+ positively influence the same enzyme activity. if yes then how.
More info is necessary.\nHow were the enzymes prepared and purified?\nWhat's your exact experiment?\nDo you see an increase in enzyme activity when you put both Ca and EDTA at the same time and if so at which molar ratio of the two effectors?\nDo you also see activation for each effector separately? How does it compare quantitatively to the effect of the combination of the effectors?\n\nMy wild guess would be that Ca+2 is an allosteric activator, EDTA removes another metal that was co-purified with the enzyme and the latter metal is an inhibitor. If  both have a positive effect on their own and an even higher when combined then it could be the case.\nAnother more extreme case is that EDTA removes the catalytic ion (if it can form a more stable complex than with Ca) and Ca takes its place. Then EDTA alone should kill the reaction while in combination with Ca have a positive effect. However this is a quite improbable scenario since enzymes usually have evolved for best performance and thus the enzyme would be expected to have the very common Ca+2 in the catalytic center to begin with, if Ca+2 aids the reaction more."
"what netforce is needed to maintain the constant velocity of a car moving in a straight line? explain?

The net force needed is zero.  Force is mass * acceleration, and acceleration suggests a change in velocity.  For constant speed and direction, the acceleration is zero, and hence the net force is zero.  When moving at constant velocity, the frictional and drag forces (which work to slow the car) and the drive force of the engine are exactly equal and opposite.  The net force is the sum of these two opposite forces, and hence the net force is Zero."

He published this proposal in 1859 in the book The Origin of Species, which remains his most famous work.\n\n\n2.  Alfred Russel Wallace was a Welsh naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist.

"What stretches are best to prevent shin splints from occurring after jogging?
Believe me, I stretch & warm up prior to & after jogging. I am a jogging newbie, but I have properly raised my endurance level over time gradually to pick up the pace. I jog on a level dirt area so the ground isn't an issue. It never fails...I always end up with some pain post-run on the shin area above the ankle. Do any seasoned joggers have any advice on how I can alleviate the pain? Are there any specific stretches that target the shin area? Do I have to live with pain? Help! ((Only answers from REAL joggers please))
Take a Dixie cup or some other small paper cup and put water in there and freeze it.  After you get back from the run, grab the ice and tear of the paper a little ways to uncover the ice.  Then use it to massage your ankles and shins.  This really helps stop the swelling and inflamation and thus the pain.  Popping a few Advil can also help get rid of the inflamation.  Try running on grass.  It's softer and absorbs more of the force.  Also go out to a running store and have them help you pick out shoes.  I remember walking into one once and they had me take off my shoes and walk in front of them.  They came back with a pair of shoes the fit my high arches perfectly and gave me the right amount of support.  It was pretty amazing and it did help my shin splints get better.  If you find that the right shoes, grass running, and ice massages don't help, you may actually have stress fractures.  Give it a few weeks to see if the pain goes away.  If you still have it, and it hurts to even walk, go into your doctor for an xray.  Before I got really good shoes I had shin splints so bad that I was actually getting really close to tearing through my tendions.  At least that's what my doctor said.  Hope that helps!  Oh, and one last thing, never ignore the pain.  It means that your body needs to recover and heal.  I used to just ""walk off"" most of my injuries, including pulled muscles in my back.  I ended up doing a lot of damage to my body and I can't run anymore.  I'm only 23 and was a competative sprinter for 6 years.  I cant even take a lesurly jog anymore.

"what is the differences of religion?
can someone please tell me the dofferences in he roman catholic religion and christianity? what do the catholics do that are against chrisitianity, and what do christians do that the catholics do not. Please answer, i am putting on a play at church with children, and need to know the anwers to this question.
Christianity: Christians believe in Jesus Christ, son of God. So they have, besides the Old Testament (which is also a holy book for jews) also the New Testament.\n\nChristians, in their history, have divided themselves for several reasons (some theological, others also more ""political"").\n\nNowadays Christians, which all believe in the same things, are divided in groups:\n\nCatholic Christians: they recognize the Pope in Rome to be the supreme guide and the descendant (in a metaforical sense) of Pietro (the first Pope and disciple of Jesus).\nThis religion is mainly practiced in Western Europe and parts of Africa.\nOrthodox Christians: They have split from Catholics. They do not have one official supreme guide. Their priests are called Pope.\nThis religion, originated in Bisantium (Istanbul), is practiced mainly in Eastern Europe and Greece (Russia, Ukraine)\nProtestants (or reformed) Christians: these split much later then Orthodox from the Catholic religion and, to some extent, show the more closeness to Catholicism. A great protestant reformer was Matin Luther who fought agains the Catholic hierarcy. The main differences between protestants and Catholics are:\n- the relationship with God is much more personal and individual\n- the religious hierarchy (the ""priest"") does not exist\n\nProtestants and Orthodox do not consider the Pope as being the supreme guide of the curch.\n\nProtestants have divided in many different groups some of which, in fear of furious persecution, fled to other countries (among which the USA) to practice their beliefs freely.\n\nTheologically speaking all Christian religions have the same ""core"" beliefs, but express themselves and are organized differently (very differently in some cases).\n\nThere are many theological differences, but I believe this is irrelevant to the play at school...\n\nBut there is nothing these religions ""do against each other"" they all come from the same source: the teachings of Jesus the Nazaren and the Vangels. They divided and separated eachother during the two millennia of Christiandom's history."
"what is the main differece between the classes mollusca and bivalvia?

Um, mollusca is not a class...\n\nMollusca is a phylum, and bivalvia is a class under that phylum. \n\nThe major mollusk classes are Gastropoda (snails and slugs),  Bivalvia (clams, mussels, and shipworms), Cephalopoda (squid, octopuses, cuttlefish, and nautilus), Polyplacophora (chitons), Scaphopoda (tooth shells), Monoplacophora (a single-shelled animal), and the little-known Aplacophora (a questionable mollusk).\n\nBivalves have two shells, or valves, that are compressed on either side of the body. The shells are made from the excretions of the mantle as in gastropods, but are very different in shape and some functions.\nThe two shells enclose most of the body, and strong muscles inside the shell keep the two valves tightly closed. The shells open only to take in and release water or to allow the foot to extend into the sand."
"Biological contact between North and South America causing massive extinction?
I have read that all life in South America was similar to Australia-and that upon physical contact, the North American animals invaded South America and out-competed the native animals-  Are there any animals left from this, like possums?  Anyone?  Calmecita?
Well, the GABI (Great American Biotic Interchange) went both ways, and several families of mammals from North America came to South America, and viceversa. However, only few native South Americans remain today in North America (NA), whereas many originally Holarctic families are thriving in South America (SA) at present. \n\nThe above answerer has outlined the three major ""strata"" defined by GG Simpson for the mammals of SA. The ""original"" South American mammals before the GABI included marsupials (shared with Australia, but forming a distinct cohort with different families) but also the exclusively South American xenarthrans (although there is a possible fossil anteater from Europe), and the Caviomorph rodents (closely related to the hystricognathous African rodents). In addition, there were some carnivores that had made it from NA. \n\nAfter the Panama land bridge appeared, the GABI was intense. North and South American faunas mixed and they appear to have coexisted for a long time. \nThe subsequent Pleistocene extinctions involved groups of both origins, but the South American natives were more intensely affected. Among the hypotheses to explain this,  interspecific competition has been mentioned, but also climatic changes. \nFirst of all, direct competition is _very_ difficult to prove, and more so with respect to fossil remains from strata that may not be exactly coeval. A more recent and preferred explanation involves a little paleoclimatology. \n** During the glaciations (and other stressful periods), South American conditions were more benign, because the continent is closer to the Equator, whereas environments in NA were much harsher, facilitating the extinction of the South American immigrants, along with many native North American giant forms. \n**In addition, the Central American corridor, which had been at first a savanna-like environment that permitted passage, later in the Pleistocene became more like a tropical forest. Then many cursorial (running) animals that inhabited open areas were unable to ""cross the bridge"". The giant ground sloths and glyptodonts were trapped in NA, and when climate and vegetation kept changing toward colder and drier conditions, became extinct.\n\nAnimals left from this: \nAmong the original South American natives, only the xenarthrans (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and marsupials (opossums)[early inhabitants], and the caviomorph rodents (originally derived from their African relatives) [second stratum colonizers] are alive today. The immensely diverse native ungulates went extinct, along with the representatives of the megafauna (giant sloths, glyptodonts, etc). At least one species of armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is expanding its range in NA today, and the opossums (I remember Didelphis virginiana, not sure if there are others) are well established there. Caviomorph rodents also occur in NA (porcupines, genus Erethizon), but are mostly confined to Central America. \nThese are the South American contributions to North American fauna. In contrast, about 50% of the South American mammal genera have North American origin.\n\nWith respect to birds, at least the Passeriformes Suboscines are South American in origin, but I have no idea _when_ they colonized NA. They include the Tyrannidae (tyrant flycatchers). Other birds with Neotropical origin are the hummingbirds (Trochiliformes or Apodiformes).\n\n---------------------\nUpdate:\nMmm... I’m not sure what you call “non-speed strategies”. Predators? Running forms such as ungulates? There were many native ungulates in South America and they went extinct; also many marsupial predators such as the marsupial sabertooth “cat”  that also disappeared. Many caviomorph rodents are cursorial (capybaras, agoutis, etc).\nI would relate it more to size. Size _is_ a constraint because large animals have different energetic balance and need large amounts of food and room. And those went extinct in both co"

This is the reason why christians are frightning. They never question authority.

"In calculus, does the signma notation always mean take the antiderivative and then evaluate over the interval?

I think you're slightly confused. ∑ is sigma, and refers to summation. The integration symbol ∫ is called the ""long s."" And what it refers to is integration. Although the simplest method of evaluating an integral is usually antidifferentiation (especially when exact solutions are desired), this is not the only method, and there are many functions which are integrable, but whose antiderivative cannot be written in terms of elementary functions. e^(x²) is one such function. In these cases, other methods, such as numerical integration or taylor series expansion, must be used to evaluate the integral.\n\nAlso, as mentioned by the previous poster, if the ∫ symbol appears without limits it refers to the antiderivative in general (which can still be defined using the integral, even if it cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions)."

I'm not sure I understand your question.\nDo you mean that, ""If ""bananas"", a never-before seen or imagined item suddenly appeared out of thin air, then Athiests would believe that these bananas came from monkeys""?\n\nIf so, then I would answer by saying that very rarely (if ever) do new objects suddenly appear from no source.

More reasonably, they would study the ""bananas"" and if after many trials, the ""bananas"" were not identified to have come from anywhere, they would probably classify ""bananas"" as a new type of ""super-material"" and leave it for future generations to ponder.\n\nIn regards to your question about proving the non-existance of such ""bananas"", that would be easy. All you have to do is show that ""bananas"" appeared recently. Then you could easily say that because no ""bananas"" existed before the date they first appeared, they must not have existed then.

"Is my tooth falling out due to me pushing unconciously with my tongue at night?
For some reason, i feel like my front bottom tooth, second out from the middle line, is falling. or is loose. Sometimes at night i wake up and i feel my tongue pushing tight on my teeth. so i wonder if this could be the reason why i feel this? or if it's true that my tooth will fall. i'm testing it by pushing the base and it feels strong, but i don't know why i feel this sensation. so what do you say physically possible for a person to push their teeth at night so that they dislocate? or am i crazy?
I actaully had the same problem, i asked my dentist and he made a mouthpiece for me to wear at night. he said it is possible to push enough to make it fall out, though highly unlikely. my best advice would be to call you dentist. he may make you a plastic tray to wear when you sleep. it sould take about a week. good luck!"

"What was the pennsylvanian epoch?

The Pennsylvanian Epoch was a period of geological time in the Carboniferous, between 320 and 292 million years ago.\n\nIt was during this time period that the first reptiles and synapsids (the mammal-like reptiles that led to mammals) evolved.\n\nIt was also during this period that the super-continent of Pangea formed, driving up the vast mountain range that has today eroded back down into the Appalachians.\n\nThere is some evidence that oxygen levels in the atmosphere were considerably higher than they are now, either as cause or result of the lush, dense forest growth that occurred in this period.  This rich, moist atmosphere supported creatures like Meganuron, the giant 2' dragonfly, that probably couldn't survive today.\n\nThe dense forests that thrived at this time formed the thick coal beds that are found in places like Pennsylvania, and it is these coal beds that led to the name for the epoch."
"What things make a home appreciate? What should I be looking for when I buy a home(investment-wise)?

Are you buying a home to live in, and looking for the best appreciation, or buying a home for renting out and future appreciation?\n\nI ask because there are different answers to those 2 scenarios. In both cases, the surest ways to make money on a house is to buy one that needs work, cosmetically (paint, new carpet, lawn cleanup etc), but doesnt have serious (and expensive) structural issues. (New roof...borderline...new sill plates due to termites...no.)  Houses that need repair sell at a discount. Thats because much of the market has no interest in fixing up their new purchase. Also, work you can do yourself is the equivalent of saving the amount you would have paid for labor, in some markets that can be as much as $40 / hour.\nOther keys... only buy a house that has a negative feature that can be fixed. For example, you can cut down dead trees, but you cant move a house that is across the street from a strip joint.\nRemember its Location, location, location in real estate. Finally, an extra bath is worth more than an extra bedroom. 3 bedrooms and 2 baths is much better than 4BR and 1 bath"
"Testing for IBS?
I've been having symtoms of what I think may be an ulcer or IBS lately. I was tested for an ulcer and all kinds of bacterial stomach infections and everything came back fine.\n\nMy doctor scheduled me to come in and do a barium test for IBS tomorrow morning.\n\nIs this standard procedure for testing for IBS? What else could they possibly be looking for?\nI thought there was no positive way to identify IBS for sure.
This is normal testing for IBS.  Many years ago, my doctor at the time thought I had IBS, and I had the barium enema and upper GI testing done.  Nothing was found, but 2 years ago I had very bad symptoms and had a colonoscope.  It was really unpleasant but at least I had a firm diagnosis of colitis.  Not what I wanted to hear but at least I know what I'm dealing with and can treat it.  With further diagnostic testing, you will find out for sure what you have.  It may take time but if you're having problems, keep with it.  I find it's better to know what I'm dealing with and treat it properly than to continue to have problems and let the condition get worse.  There are many conditions that affect the bowel--Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis, polyps among others."
"Should I short-sell Google stock (GOOG)?

Not unless you like lots of risk. Google is a very volatile stock.  There is no doubt that Google is over valued but let me remind you of the internet bubble of 1998-2000. These stock were overpriced in 1998 but that did not prevent them from rising another 5 fold--some of which were not worth the paper the certificates were printed on--Global Crossing comes to mind. Cisco was selling at 20 in 1998 and 100 in 2000. Now it under 20. And it is a good company. Google is too. \n\nIf you really, really have a hanckering to short Google two ways to do it to minimize your risk are as follows: 1) is to buy a put on the stock. The put will give you a period of time to sell Google at a particular price. \n\nFor example a 370 put expiring in the end of June 2006 will currently cost you $2100 for 100 shares. If the stock closes below $348 by the expiration date in June you will make money. If not you will loose your $2100 but nothing more. Of course you may ask why does the put cost so much when the stock is currently selling at 435.  Because a lot of people think it might be over priced. \n\nAs the price of Google rises and falls, the price of the options also rises and falls and as the option approaches the expiration date, its value also falls.\n\n2) short the stock and buy a call option. The call option gives you the ability to buy the stock at a given price for a given length of time. That way if Google rises 30 points the day after you short it, your loss is limited to the cost of the call option."

"do u eny cool facts about wind power??
i just need some kool facts for a science project!\n\nthanks
Ok here ya go!\n\n In 2005, worldwide capacity of wind-powered generators was 58,982 MW, their production making up less than 1% of world-wide electricity use. Although still a relatively minor source of electricity for most countries, wind power generation more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2005.\n\nMost modern wind power is generated in the form of electricity by converting the rotation of turbine blades into electrical current by means of an electrical generator. In windmills (a much older technology) wind energy is used to turn mechanical machinery to do physical work, like crushing grain or pumping water.\n\nWind power is used in large scale wind farms for national electrical grids as well as in small individual turbines for providing electricity in isolated locations.\n\nWind energy is abundant, inexhaustible, widely distributed, clean, and mitigates the greenhouse effect.\n\nAn estimated 1 to 3 % of energy from the Sun that hits the earth is converted into wind energy. This is about 50 to 100 times more energy than is converted into biomass by all the plants on earth through photosynthesis. Most of this wind energy can be found at high altitudes where continuous wind speeds of over 160 km/h (100 mph) occur. Eventually, the wind energy is converted through friction into diffuse heat all through the earth's surface and atmosphere.\n\nThe origin of wind is simple. The earth is unevenly heated by the sun resulting in the poles receiving less energy from the sun than the equator does. Also the dry land heats up (and cools down) more quickly than the seas do. The differential heating powers a global atmospheric convection system reaching from the earth's surface to the stratosphere which acts as a virtual ceiling.\n\nThe change of seasons, change of day and night, the Coriolis effect, the irregular albedo (reflectivity) of land and water, humidity, and the friction of wind over different terrain are some of the factors which complicate the flow of wind over the surface."
"What is the difference between strep throat and scarlet fever?
My doctor advised me that my son has strep throat and not scarlet fever.  I have looked at descriptions online but both sound the same to me.  There obviously a ifference can anyone advise?
Please see the webpages for more details on Strep throat and Scarlet fever.\nStreptococcus- A genus of bacteria. Gram-positive cocci, often occuring in chains of varying length. Require enriched media for growth and the colonies are small. Saprophytic (saprophyte-Free living micro-organisms obtaining food from dead and decaying animal or plant tisue) and parasitic species. Pathogenic species produce powerful toxins. In man they are responsible for numerous infections such as scarlatina (scarlet fever), tonsillitis (inflammation of tonsils), erysipelas (an acute, specific,infectious disease, in which there is a spreading, streptococcal inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, accompanied by fever and constitutional disturbances),  endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining of the heart-endothelium-most commonly due to rheumatic fever), rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis ( a term used in bilateral, non-suppurative inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidneys), and wound infections in hospital.\nScarlet fever- Infection by haemolytic streptococcus producing a rash. Occurs mainly in children. Begins commonly with a throat infection, leading to pyrexia (fever) and the outbreak of a punctate (dotted or spotted) erythematous (reddening) eruption of the skin. Characteristically the area around the mouth escapes (circumoral palor). In strep throat, there is no such rash."

You are addressing the theory of scales.\nOn the macroscale, humans look like, well, humans ie. their eyes, hands, etc.\nOn the microscale, humans look like their cells because the body is made of cells\nOn the nanoscale, humans look like atoms because the cells are made of atoms.\n\nOne can think of th euniverse in a similar manner, like you have done.

"why is it colder the higher you go?
If heat rises, and the higher you go the closer you are to the sun, then why the higher you go the colder it gets?? \n\nis it because the air molecules have less friction to each other since they are thinner(or finer) then when they are down close to earth. beacause down to earth they are bigger so that causes more friction which may cause the heat?!?!?!
When gas is compressed in a thermally insulated vessel the gas is heated.\n\nWhen pressure increases temperature increases.\n\nSimilarly if the gas is expanded in a thermally insulated vessel the gas is cooled.\n\nWhen the pressure decreases the temperature decreases. \n\nNear earth’s surface, the atmospheric pressure is very high.\n\nAt a height of 30km from the surface, the pressure of air is almost zero.\n\nThough the hot air goes up; as it goes up the pressure decreases and volume increases (density decreases) and as per the  gas equation the temperature decreases."

"is there a cure for schizophrenia?

The word ""schizophrenia"" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a ""mental illness"", and promotes it as a ""disease"" that requires ""treatment"".\n\nIt is not a ""disease"", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes ""schizophrenia"" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or ""chemical imbalance"".\n\n""For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign."" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n""Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea."" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as ""schizophrenia"" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as ""bipolar"" and ""schizophrenia"" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including ""schizophrenia"". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a ""faith"", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called ""research"" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that ""schizophrenia"" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nSee also http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#S"

"How come birds can sit on power lines with out getting electrocuted?
As I under stand that as long as you only touch one cable and you are not earthed (you are not touching the ground) you will not get a shock.  I'm a little scyptical is all...
The only reason you get shocked when you touch one phase and ground in the commercial power distribution system is because the commercial power distribution system uses a grounded system where the earth itself is used instead of a wire.  Commercial power distribution I believe (and I may be wrong on this) uses Wye (pronounced ""Y"") connected three phase power with the center grounded allowing the earth itself to be used in place of the fourth wire.  In a balanced 3-phase system (all loads draw the same amount of power from all three phases) the center is not required, but few people have three phase blenders, so only a single phase of the power is sent to an outlet along with the neutral which is grounded.  If you look at Naval electrical distribution systems, they are ungrounded.  Navy schools teach that the use of an ungrounded system raises reliability because two faults to ground on two different phases are required to disable the electrical distribution system, and that in ideal conditions one can touch a single phase and ground and not be shocked.  Berkeley challenges this and I have included a link to their web sight.  I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle because I have touched a single phase and ground and been shocked.  It was a 440V wire, and I definitely felt it, but it was not nearly as sever as being shocked by an outlet (115V) so ungrounded reduced the severity, but did not eliminate the shock.  The electricity that I felt was probably from capacitance in the insulation.  To any one who cares, I managed to shock myself while removing a dead front fuse.  Dead front fuses are ""idiot proof"", but you know what happens every time they make something that is ""idiot proof""?  They make a better idiot to go with it.  (:"
"in space,is there an up or down or is everything up and down???
if your in space can you be upside down,due to no gravity,or is there really no upside down and your always up???
Up and down, in space, on earth, anywhere are established by convention.  Up is the direction we all agree to be up.  Usually, on earth we choose toward the center of the earth or along the earths gravity gradient to be down and up to be in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a place (like most of space) without a single over-powering gravity gradient, you have to develop a different convention.  If you watch the space shuttle astronauts, they tend to follow a convetion established by the shuttle builders.  Things are arranged, labeled, etc with the assumption of a floor and a ceiling and this provides the up/down convetion."

"looking for description for algorithm to search matching names with dial digits.eg.dir service in phones?
looking for name or description for algorithm to search matching names with dial digits.eg.\ndirectory service in some of phones which lets you search directory with last name.  \nIt is also implemented as some cellphones as fast find feature.
There's a number of ways to do that. Just understand that each name has its sequence of dial digits. You should index by these digits to lookup.\n\nSo if you have a database, just make a table of pairs: names and matching dial digits. Index by dial digits. Then you can lookup fast.\n\nIf you want to do that manually, you might sort your huge name list by sequence of dial digits, and then lookup fast with binary search (logarithmic time). This way you do not even have to store your dial digits for each name. In C++ this could be done with e.g. a std::set of strings sorted by dial digits.\n\nI hope this is clear.

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of power?
The different types of power are to be related to power to prepare meals. For example the gas oven and say a toaster.
First of all, depending on the current state of the economy when it relates to enegery, different types of energy can be more cost effective.  But that can change from year to year.  One year it could be gas that's cheapest, the next electricity, and the opposite true for some state up north.  \n\nAs far as meal preperation and the quality of the meal is concerned, there is one majorly huge drawback to using microwave heat as opposed to anything else.  microwaves heat mostly the water in an item and nothing else.  this causes the moisture to seperate it's more solid bond from the particles of food and gather all in one place.  you would think it would rise to the top but it varies depending on the type of dish.  either way what u can sometimes get is soggy food.  on the other hand, sometimes the food ends up being too dry because all of the water leaves it when it's heated to steam.  but when you use a stove or a toaster or a toaster oven, you're using regular old heat to cook something, and heat doesn;t discriminate as much as microwave energy.  it cooks solids and liquids pretty much the same.  micorwaves are great for frozen items because the water is typically ice.  but it will never taste as good as another source of heat.  as far as any differrence between a toaster and an over and a toaster oven?  it's all about the size and shape of the food you are cooking.  toaster overns don;t take as long to heat but don;t heat very large items whereas toasters heat even more quickly but only work on thin slices of bread.  gas heat and electric heat work about the same way.  it's all based on the temprature of the air."

I didn't give it a thumbs down, and I think the answer is fine as far as it goes.  However, one problem that I noticed is that you have a circular definition.  You said electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic waves.  I assume you meant to say electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic *fields*, which is correct."
"If a nuclear bomb exploded in space, what  do you think will happen, would it create a black hole?

During the time when atmospheric testing was still being done, several tests of nuclear bombs were done in the far upper atmosphere (nearby space). Certainly no black holes were created. There were brief electrical disruptions and the explosions were spherical, rather than mushroom cloud shaped, but otherwise they were simply big explosions. The energy associated to even a small black hole is many, many times more than anything we have ever created on earth."

I work at a gym and try to counsel a lot of the ladies that come there.  Here is the advice that i give to many of them who like to binge on fatty foods and eat when depressed.  Stop buying those fatty foods.  Stop tempting yourself.  If it isn't there, you can't eat it.  (Clean out your kitchen and pantry --excuse to exercise- lift all those cans and garbage outside!) I tell them that they should shoot for only eating foods that they have to prepare themselves.  To actually cook.  This might stop you from wanting a snack if you actually have to make it.  Have apples and fruits around instead of snacks.  Have yogurt around.  when eating fruits, cut them up and slow yourself down.  PORTION is very important.  If you are going to eat something fatty, MEASURE it out.  if you have a whole bag of chips there you will eat till you are overfull.  Measure it out so you only binge a little.  Cravings go away after 15-20 mins.  DRINK A LOT OF WATER.  Get a picture out of your target weight loss.  Look at it and know that you can achieve it.  You're in a funk right now but only you can get yourself out of it.  Be healthy.  just look at your daughter and see all the motivation you need.  From what you wrote, you already know what you want to do.  Now go and do it. Good Luck!!!"
"do you get bipolar from something tramatizing?
my mom died a year and half ago and ever since then i've had severe mood swings so i took the test and the level was as high as it would go.
Funny that you should mention losing your mother, because in an article I recently read about causes of bipolar, one that was expressedly listed was ""a death in the family"". I'm not sure of your age, as that may have something to do with it, but in these situations, see a psychologist, and if you are diagnosed with it (or not), I would get a few other opinions, because it is a major disorder. \n\nNot to call you crazy or any of that, but it's something to be taken very seriously, because it can really effect your life in a strongly negative way if you don't take care of it.\n\nAll people vary, and I don't know your age. For all I know this could be a part of puberty that just had coincidental timing or something of that nature. Surely see someone and do some research, I've included a great site to read up on it.\n\nhttp://bipolar.about.com/cs/bpbasics/a/what_causes_bp.htm"
"How far above the perforations are ESP's tyrpical set in an oil well?
Oil Industry use.
There is no 'set' distance above wellbore perforations for a Submersible Pump to be installed.  The distance varies with the diameter of the wellbore, the capacity of the pump, and the 'natural' temperature of the wellbore fluids.\n\nSpacing between perforations and the pump array itself is crucial ONLY to prevent premature pump failure due to overheating.\n\nThe manufacturer of your ESP should provide tables to assist you in calculating the proper placement."
"Why is it when you sneeze you close your eyes? why cant you keep them open?

Similar to the reflex that occurs when your knee kicks after it's hit with a medical hammer, or the way your hand pulls away from something hot when you burn it, closing your eyes when you sneeze is a powerful reflex.\n\nA sneeze is a kind of bodywide reflex in which a lot of muscles contract, not just in the nose and throat but also those in the diaphragm, the abdomen, thighs, back, even sphincters (which is why some people with stress incontinence may urinate slightly when they sneeze). When we sneeze, we tense some of our muscles. The tensing (tightening) of our muscles causes our eyes to shut."
"What steps are necessary to diagnose lung cancer?
I have a friend whom says she has lung cancer.  I actually don't believe her.  She is only 42 yrs. old.  She said she has the opinion of 3 doctors.  My mom had lung cancer and she didn't know for sure till they did a biopsy.  This friend hasn't had a biopsy.  Is it possible to know you have lung cancer without a biopsy?
Diagnosing Lung Cancer\n\nTo help find the cause of symptoms, the doctor evaluates a person's medical history, smoking history, exposure to environmental and occupational substances, and family history of cancer. The doctor also performs a physical exam and may order a chest x-ray and other tests. If lung cancer is suspected, sputum cytology (the microscopic examination of cells obtained from a deep-cough sample of mucus in the lungs) is a simple test that may be useful in detecting lung cancer. To confirm the presence of lung cancer, the doctor must examine tissue from the lung. A biopsy -- the removal of a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist -- can show whether a person has cancer. A number of procedures may be used to obtain this tissue: \n\nBronchoscopy. The doctor puts a bronchoscope (a thin, lighted tube) into the mouth or nose and down through the windpipe to look into the breathing passages. Through this tube, the doctor can collect cells or small samples of tissue.\n\nNeedle aspiration. A needle is inserted through the chest into the tumor to remove a sample of tissue.\n\nThoracentesis. Using a needle, the doctor removes a sample of the fluid that surrounds the lungs to check for cancer cells.\n\nThoracotomy. Surgery to open the chest is sometimes needed to diagnose lung cancer. This procedure is a major operation performed in a hospital.\n\n \n ..........Lung cancer is difficult to detect early because symptoms usually do not appear until the disease is advanced. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and can include persistent cough, hoarseness or wheezing, shortness of breath, sputum streaked with blood, recurring bronchitis or pneumonia, weight loss and loss of appetite, and chest pain. \n\nPhysicians use several techniques to diagnose lung cancer, including the following:\n\nImaging Tests\nChest x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help locate abnormal areas in the lung. \n\nLow-Dose Helical CT\nA technique called low-dose helical (or spiral) CT may offer a novel approach for diagnosing lung cancer by exposing the patient to less radiation than a conventional chest CT scan while allowing the doctor to see areas of the chest normally obscured in a standard x-ray. Memorial Sloan-Kettering is now studying the effectiveness of low-dose helical CT in a clinical trial. Outside of New York, the National Cancer Institute has begun a multi-center study of the technology.\n\nCombined PET/CT Scans\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering's radiology department includes the best combined PET/CT imaging technology available in the United States. This is particularly important in imaging lung cancer, which can be difficult to identify on a regular CT. To address this situation, a PET (positron emission tomography) scan, which picks up the metabolic signal of actively growing cancer cells in the body, is run simultaneously with the CT scan. This improved imaging capability provides for superior treatment planning because the details of the tumor are better defined. \n\nBronchoscopy & Biopsies\nA sputum sample can be analyzed for the presence of cancerous cells. Doctors may perform a bronchoscopy, which allows them to examine the bronchial passages using an instrument called a bronchoscope. This is a small tube that is inserted through the nose or mouth, down the throat and into the bronchi. During the procedure physicians may remove some tissue for analysis. \n\nA modified form of bronchoscopy called autofluorescence bronchoscopy, which can detect early invasive cancers not seen with standard x-rays or white-light bronchoscopy, is being used to detect very early lung cancer. \n\nTo examine areas of the lungs that are not accessible during a bronchoscopy, physicians may perform a needle biopsy (""fine needle aspiration"" or FNA) to remove a small sample of tissue for analysis."
"Tips for surviving a month with the in-laws?
My in-laws are very intense - they are from a totally different culture and speak a different language! We're going to stay with them for a month - help please?!
This will be a big test of your love for your spouse if you can pull this off without wanting to get out of the family completely.  I would suggest that you go in with an open mind and a servant heart.  Show interest in the things they find interesting--especially if it is in doing things a different way than you do.  Be willing to help out with chores--not to take over--but to go along side those working to show you are wanting to be with them and learn how they like things done.\n\nMost importantly, find time for time alone with your spouse and don't vent your frustrations to him, even if he is venting his frustrations to you.  And find time alone where you can clear your mind, re-commit yourself to being a learner and servant and have a cell phone so you can call up a friend you know you can vent your frustrations to!"
"why does the color on your clothes change when you put sodium hypo chloprite?

Sodium hypochloride is a strong bleaching agent. Chemically, it is an oxidant: \n\n2 H2O + 2 ClO(1-) + 4 electrons -> 4 OH(1-) + 2 Cl(1-)\n\nThe chlorine in the hypochloride changes from one positive charge to one negative charge.\n\nWhen your clothes change colour, it is because the dyes get oxidated. Dyes usually have complex systems of double-bonds in the molecule in order to absorb visible light. These double-bonds usually are reactive and can get chlorinated (in which case some of the Cl(1-) in the equation above ends up in the molecule) or subsequently hydrolized (which results in the formation of an alcohol)."
"Need help identifying a bird!?
I found a dead bird (I finally picked it up with a shovel and plastic bag and threw it away) and I'd really like to know what species it is!\n\nIt was about the size of a small crow or large grackle. It was all dark brown with a light brown, sorta fluffy breast. That's really the only way I can describe it - sort of like a brown crow. Definitely not a bird of prey, but it was not a bird I had ever seen here before (I live in a suburb of Chicago). And it was not small!\n\nI've tried searching online but it's hard to narrow down my search since I don't know what kind of bird it was (oriole, magpie, finch, whatever). Any help is appreciated, thanks!
Here are some good sites for bird identification:\n\nhttp://www.enature.com/fieldguides/intermediate.asp?curGroupID=1\nhttp://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/Infocenter/infocenter.html\n\nBut, as you say, it can be hard to find something on these sites if you don't already have an idea of what you're looking for.\n\nMy guesses would include European Starling, Brown-headed Cowbird, Rusty Blackbird, or a Brewer's Blackbird.  I think the highest probabilities would be a female of one of the blackbird species.\n\nHope this helps!"
"My mother's right breast is removed in hubli cancer hospital in 2002, now her right hand is swelling?
In year 2002 My mother's right breast removed due cancer in 2nd stage, after surgery, kemotherapy and radiation.  Now from last month she is suffering from swelling in her right hand, we approached the cancer hospital doctor, he said that continue with your exercises and gave some medicine. But still no improvement.
The swelling may not necessarily be because of cancer  though that may be the first consideration.\n\nThe body has a second set of vessels other than blood vessels called the lymphatic system and this collects fluid and fatty stuff from around cells and transports them back to one of the big veins near your heart. Sometimes, these can get blocked and lead to the swelling.\n\nThe blockage could be a result of damage during surgery or radiation previously. It could also be because of a recurrence that is causing enlarged nodes or other tissue to press on and block the lymphatics. \n\nThe exercises are quite important but I also think your mother needs to have a chat with the doctors to establish that it is just damaged lymphatics and nothing else."
"Can green tea help a plant grow?
My son is doing a science project and I was just wondering if anyone has every heard of a plant being grown using green tea instead of water.
The novel chemical compounds in Green Tea are called polyphenolics.  You'll here all sorts of other terms thrown out there, but they're ALL under the family of polyphenols.\n\nThese chemicals are thought to provide a detoxifying effect in mammalian cells.  To some extent, this is true.\n\nIn plants however, these compounds target nothing, and do nothing.  \n\nIn a science experiment, IF the plant grown with tea performs better, I would say it's because of the inert matter in tea.  This stuff is easily broken down in the soil and functions as a very weak, but steady source of nutrition (fertilizer).\n\nSo the short answer : NO."

"Why do muscles hurt when you exercise?
My friend has been exercising for about a month now and sometimes, in the begining of her exercise (treadmill) she would feel a burnining sesation in her leg muscles. What is the reason for that? Shouldnt her muscles be used to the exercises by now? Also Knees hurt when she does lunges (i think that is what they are called). I think its basically if she rests her weight a bit on the knees, they hurt. Also a similar burning feeling. Any explanation?
Your friend needs to stretch her legs really well to start with.  The muscle soreness can be caused by many things.  The term ""feel the burn"" was coin a long time ago in reference to working out.  It is true that if you work a muscle group intensely it will begin to burn.  That is the point that you are making gains though.  You are pushing the muscles past their normal work level and ability.  Again at this point I emphasize stretching.  Stretch before and after a workout.  Especially a cardio workout.  After a while your friend may even gage how well her workout went by how sore she is afterward.  One thing that definitely needs to be addressed.  Resting on a knee during lunges is bad form, and can cause injury.  She should also make sure she warms up before exercising."

"If a Fly lands inside a bus. and sits on top of the seat. and the Bus drives 70 miles per hour what happens?

Just asking Can't figure this one out.  Thanks
Well, the air around it isn't moving, quite like it is outside.  So it is able to move around in this air far more capably.  Also, it does get affected by the enertia, but it's so good at flying that it is able to compensate for the difference.  Now if you were to take out all the glass and replace it with mesh you would definately see a difference with the fly.  It wouldn't be able to fight against the current of air around it, and would be forced to the back of the bus, the same would be true for your face.:P"

"Be careful for what you wish. What did you wish for and get that you wish you hadn't?
I have gooten things I wanted so much but when I look back I realize they were not good for me. I want to hear from other people what they wanted and recieved and wish they hadn't gotten.
My ex-girlfriend. Her name was Amie. I posted a Christian ad at the personals and she responded telling me everything I wanted to hear.  I looked at her profile and it looked as if she wrote it specifically to match everything I was looking for.  She posed as a Christians girl but after months of her lies being exposed, I found out she was a prostitute (luckily I wasnt having sex with her) which would explain why she was always getting drunk and grabbing at my ""member"".  I can honestly say I know how it feels for women to be sexually harrassed and ""man-handled"" all the time- this woman never stopped! Anyways after months of her trying we quit hanging out after some serious arguments- she called me 3-4 times a day to argue with me and hung up on me as soon as she got me angry- it was very hard to remain a Christian with her and even worse when we split up. I got tired of her calls and insults so the last time she hung up on me I called her and left a message and emailed her to tell her what a worthless piece of crap I thought she was- 2 days later I got served with a restraining order and ended up going to court in front of a judge she knew personally (probably a client) and he did not let me say one thing in my defense- so I have a restraining order on my record because someone who wouldnt leave ME alone, got mad when I responded to her insults. I NEVER went to her house or called her to harrass her, she did it to me! Needless to say I am not too happy with our legal system when an innocent person can be victimized so easily by a lunatic with the courts help. The story is much longer but I tried to shorten it up - but this was something I asked for, but found out later it was bad for me- Although, maybe what I was asking for would have been ok, if she wouldnt have been an imposter!?"

What is the probability that a pen from the first box and a marker from the second box are selected? Write your answer as a fraction in lowest terms
Probability is the measure of how likely an event is. Is is given by the formula: \nP = (The Number Of Ways an Event Can Occur) divided by (The Total Number Of Possible Outcomes) \n\n1) To find the probability for a pen to be selected from the first box, you write the number of pens over the total number of items in the box. So: \n\n2 (number of pens) / 10 ( total items in the box) \n\nwhich reduces to 1/5. \n\n2) To find the probabilty for a marker to be selected from the second box, you do the same thing. \n2 (markers) / 5 ( total items in the box) which cannot be reduced. \n\nThe answers are 1/5 and 2/5. \nHope this helps ;-)"

There is no sure way to lose it from the stomach area.

Crunches, kicks are an example. Just remember when you work out to keep the stomach muscles tight to tone and build muscle ( muscle weight more than fat, so you'll prolly stay the same weight, but have a flatter abdomin.)"
"how is a stapler assembled ?

I would suggest that you select a particular stapler that you are interested in and ""reverse engineer"" it in your mind.  Does it use threaded fasteners or permanent rivets?  Imagine the riveting process being reversed (like playing a film backwards).  For example, if your stapler has a plastic piece where you press down on it, would it be easier to add that piece to all the staplers in production before assembling the entire stapler?  Try to identify the sub-assemblies (like the plastic piece) to determine the order in which the entire stapler is assembled from many parts.  Sometimes the order is mandatory and irreversible and sometimes it is arbitrary.  You could perform a similar process to figure out how an entire automobile is assembled and the entire motor would be a sub-assembly in itself.  Good luck."
"Why do Na & Mg behave so differently in water?

They actually behave similarly in water.  But it seems like a big difference because of the explosive reaction that occurs when Na comes in contact with water.  Mg also reacts with water, but to a much lesser extent.\n\nThe basic reason is reactivity.  Na is very unstable.  It's so unstable that it must be stored in the absence of oxygen.  Being located near the upper left hand corner of the periodic table, It wants to lose an electron to reach the electron configuration of Ne.  Mg is significantly more stable because you would need to remove its 2 valence electrons to reach noble gas configuration.  You can see the quantitative relationship of this by looking up the ionization energies of Na and Mg.  You'll see that the IE of Na is very small, while the first IE of Mg is significantly larger.  The second IE of Mg should be relatively small, but there is a barrier to that due to the first IE."

"Are you legally considered Catholic if you were christened as a Catholic?
If you were christened as a catholic, and your father is catholic, but are not a member of a Catholic church, are you still legally considered Catholic?
Whether or not you are Catholic is not a question of legality. It is a question of Spirituality.\n\nTry to think of your Baptism's wider implications. The Catholic Church recognizes and respects baptisms that take place in other Christian denominations. That is because, once baptized, we become members of His church; either directly as Catholics, or indirectly as non-Catholic Christians.\n\nOnce Baptized, you are considered Christian. In your case, a Catholic Christian. You may be inactive in your church, but that does not in any way nullify your baptism."
"Determine the pH of a 0.4 M tartic acid solution.?
The pKa of tartic acid, HOOC-(CHOH)2-COOH, the major acidic component of wine, is 2.98 Determine the pH of a 0.4 M tartic acid solution.
Well first you need to find the Ka of tartic acid: 10^-pKa = 1.05 x 10^-3.\n\nThen you create and ICE Table and solve for the Equilibrium concentration of Hydronium ions which gives you 0.02 M\n\nLastly, you find the pH which is -log [H3O+] = 1.6\n\nHope this helps"
"What is the connection between insulin & weight gain?
I have a friend who has started injecting Rx insulin - she claims that it causes her to gain weight. But she has not been able to describe to me how the medication works.\n\nWhen she is going to eat, she checks her blood sugar for her insulin dosage....  If she is in need of insulin, does she have a healthy reason to eat? Could she only eat when her blood sugar level dropped to a normal range? Wouldn't that be healthier? And if  there are circumstances when she eats with high blood sugar & insulin, isn't that a time to eat very sparingly?\n\nIt seems to me that the insulin injection converts the blood sugar to fat storage, so the when she eats more, the blood sugar level won't be dangerous for her health. But, doesn't it mean that she already ate more than she needs - that's why her blood sugar is high? Is there a correlation between insulin injecting and weight/fat gain?
Correction- insulin does not remove glucose from the urine. It removes it from the bloodstream, and redirects it to glycogen, to be stored in the tissues.  It can also be stored as fat. IF her blood sugar is too high, she is eating the wrong things. She needs to watch her diet, and have a low carb profile. IF she eats low-carb, then her blood sugar will not spike like that, and the insulin will have nothing to act upon in a negative fashion.\n\nHer blood sugar is high to begin with because of a lack of natural insulin in her body, which then needs to be supplemented by injected insulin. The job of insulin is to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream. Excess sugar in the blood is like having a thick syrup circulating around. This is bad for the body, and causes the blood pressure to go up, which can cause strokes and heart attacks. When insulin acts in a normal body, it brings the sugar level back down to normal after a meal.\n\nShe does not need to eat more. This will really make her fat.  She needs to eat low carb more frequently.  This will keep her blood sugar more normal. \n\nThe higher the blood sugar, the  more insulin is needed, and the more the glucose will be stored as fat or glycogen.\n\nShe should never take insulin if her blood sugar level is normal or low, because insulin will still act in the same way, and drop her level to below normal. If it does go too low, she could go into a diabetic coma.\n\nIt all has to do with keeping the sugar level in balance - both with diet and with the insulin. \n\nDoes that make sense yet?"

"define sin.?
for instance.\nhow can you define sin.\nto what extent can you go that you will have done a great sin.?\nsecond to what minimum can you do to stay out of sin.?\nis there a big sin and a small sin?
Note: This is a partial answer to another question relating to the existence of God. There is more to what I have partially revealed that is far more extensive and would require a book-length treatise to fully connect the dots to the nature of God and man's connection to Him.\n\nThe human spirit dwells within the soul. The soul is a composite of both the spirit and the body. The soul dwells in the brain and controls the body through the brain. Which is why you are not dead until you are brain dead (without the aid of any machine).\n\nGod physically exists. He is just physically different. The breath of life that came from God's physical existence is the spirit of life you speak of. The human spirit itself is literally restored to God; while the soul's destination is determined by its state of existence upon separation (which takes about 1/10th of a second).\n\nIt's a bit technical, but to simplify it, think of the soul as consisting in either one of two states: in harmony with God's existence or opposite of God's existence (or the inverse).\n\nS.I.N is Spirit Inverse Nature. God is Spirit. Anything opposite of God's Nature is SIN. Spirits created from God's physical existence is made from the stuff God is made of and is naturally in harmony with God's state of perfection. When a spirit does something opposite of God's nature, or SIN, they become inverted (their physical existence is literally opposite of God's nature).\n\nBecause God is eternal and cannot cease to exist, that which is created from Him is eternal and cannot cease to exist. Thus God created a place of separation for those who are permanently inverted. This place of separation is opposite of the place where God dwells. \n\nGod is Light. Where God dwells is a place of light. The place of separation is darkness; where God does not dwell. The place where God dwells is a place of perpetual peace. The place of separation is a place of perpetual pain caused by unquenchable fire.\n\nWhen I say ""spirits"" I am speaking of beings referred to as angels and demons (inverted angels). Human spirits are made of the stuff like that of angels, but consists as the raw material from which the human soul is created (and then co-exists interdependently within the human soul). The human soul is YOU - the individual who is expressing thought, emotion, and actions through the physical body.\n\nGod Himself is The Book of Life. Every soul created from God (be it angel or human), are written in The Book of Life (which means are in harmony with God's state of existence from conception). If an angel inverts, it is permanent because angels are made of the same stuff that God is made of: ENERGY.\n\nWhen energy changes form, it cannot change back to its original state. A raw egg when cooked can't be restored to its raw state. Thus, when an angel inverts, because it consists as conscious energy, it is permanent. Inverted angels are demons. When a spirit being inverts, they are no longer in harmony with God, and are thus removed from the Book of Life.\n\nExodus 32.31-33\nAnd Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. \n\nRevelation 20.11,12,15\n11. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\n\nThe human race are descendant"

"Is your image in a mirror 2D or 3D?
If you are looking at yourself in a mirror, do you see a 2D image or a 3D image?
We see images in mirror. Similarly we see pictures in T.V screen, Cinema screen, and in computer screen.  All we see in a single plane surfaces. \n\nConsider the moment, when all pictures seen in them are still including the image in mirror.\n\n To view them leisurely, we take photos of all and print them and paste them all in their position. \n\nWhat is the difference between the previous one and the present one?\n\nBoth are in the single plane. Behind the plane there is wall or some electrical gadgets only.\n\nIf images in mirror are three dimensional then all pictures and the drawings in the books will be three dimensional. However, we try to give the three dimensional effect in picture drawn on a plane paper. A cube can be drawn in a paper and can be visualized in three dimensions. That does not mean that the drawing is three dimensional.\n\nBut real images can have actual three dimensions. In that case we say it is a three dimensional image.  But the real image formed in a camera screen is two dimensional.\n\nHence all virtual images are two dimensions only even though they appear to be three dimensional. \n\nReal images can be either two dimensional or three dimensional. \n\nReal images are only images and are not real objects even though they are three dimensional images."
"Why is it that Religions Clash as every religionteaches the same Basics?
My question is that Every religion teaches the same basics so why the religious leaders the monks the rabbi the brahmans the mullah and every other religious leader talks about peace and prosperity to other when they are in presence of other religious leader but when they are amongst their own followers make fun of each other religion?
First we should stop understanding that religion is about Peace.\nIt is about knowing oneself, understanding oneslf and becoming who and what we are. This said, once we do, we are usually in Peace.\n\nSecond - Not all religion promote self understanding and inner Peace. Some have very specific instructions as to what to do in certain cicrumstances when one is faced with people from other beleifs. This means that if there are radically and very picky and emotially hurt people, they can apply those aspects of their scriptures and try to make them real.\n\nThird - Most all religions sees their books as a guidance and God graces passes through it. Islam's Koran is seen as the word of Allah, thus making it difficult to say that radical Islamist muslims are not following their book\n\nFourth - Many evangelical groups also focus on the Old Testament and apply intolerant and less compassionate aspects of God. In my book Jesus came to toss that understanding of God aside, but that is another subject.\n\nFifth - The Sikhs also have a sacred book and it is seen a their Guru. However, that book is treated and respected in temples...\n\nI beleive that learning how to communicate tames physical violence and brings a better way to find common grounds to share. Why we are having so much issues is when we blob religions together thinking that they give the same message of Peace. This illusion is not helping currently and creates insecurity, misunderstandings (such as the Cartoons incident) and bigger chasm. Many people really adhere to their religion and feel threathen when it is placed as something equal to other beleifs such as science, secularism, ideological and philosophical contributions to society.\n\nSo, no, religions absolutly do not have the same basis and even Goals."

"Is food heated in a microwave oven carcinogenic?

"Religion or Cult?
So what is the underlying difference. I think we all know in our gut what the difference is but if you had to explain it to someone how would you do it?
Cult is..\nIn religion and sociology, a cult is a cohesive group of people (often a relatively small and recently founded religious movement) devoted to beliefs or practices that the surrounding culture or society considers to be far outside the mainstream. Its separate status may come about either due to its novel belief system, because of its idiosyncratic practices or because it opposes the interests of the mainstream culture. Other non-religious groups may also display cult-like characteristics.\nIn common usage, ""cult"" has a negative connotation, and is generally applied to a group by its opponents, for a variety of possible reasons\n\nReligion is..\ncommonly defined as a group of beliefs concerning the supernatural, sacred, or divine, and the moral codes, practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. It is sometimes used interchangeably with ""faith"" or ""belief system."" In the course of the development of religion, it has taken many forms in various cultures and individuals.\nOccasionally, the word ""religion"" is used in the more restrictive sense of ""organized religion"" — that is, an organization of people supporting the exercise of some religion, often taking the form of a legal entity (see religion-supporting organization)."
"What kind of job is out there for a 13 year old?

Some 13-year-olds are ready to babysit. Even if you are not old enough to stay with children by yourself, some mothers would welcome your help in keeping their kids busy while they take care of other things around the house.\n\nCleaning is absolutely something you could do. If you can do something at home beyond your regular chores, your parents might be willing to pay you; if not, friends and neighbors might. You could offer general cleaning or specialize in one thing: dusting/vacuuming/laundry/bathrooms . . . whatever. \n\nLawn care is another job--if you can use a lawn mower, great, but if not, how about weeding gardens and flower beds? Raking? Picking up sticks, twigs, and other debris? Watering?\n\nNewspaper delivery--usually means getting up very early, and it's probably a lot easier on a bicycle than on foot. Not a good option if you need someone to drive you around the area!\n\nYou can't work a lot of places until you are 16, but what about a family-owned business?\n\nOne key factor is to let as many people as you can know that you are looking for work.

In dec 03, I paid him a substantial amount of money, and he promised that my case would be resolved within 4 months..Didn't happen.
If your lawyer is part of a firm with other partners, first complain, in writing, via Certified letter, to the firm's Senior Partner about this matter...if you do not get a reply within two weeks, the next step is\n Notify the State Bar Association. Provide the Bar Ethics Board with information about the date on which you first paid your alleged lawyer, a timeline of all the delays and dodges and the case number (The number the courts are using for this case) but DO NOT include specifics about the case itself...providing that information can present the risk of confidential information becoming ""discoverable"" by the opposing party and is probably not relevant to the matter of the lawyer's derilection of duty, which at first glance certainly sounds like malpractice."

Keep in mind, however, that because of the distances involved these galaxies actually collided millions of years ago, and the light is just reaching us now."
"...Which would have protein synthesis inhibited if they were grown in the presense of chloramphenicol?
The full question and possible answers are:\nChloramphenicol is a drug that inhibits protein synthesis on prokaryotic ribosomes. Which of the following cells (or parts of cells) would have protein synthesis inhibited if they were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol?\nA) bacteria\nB) chloroplasts\nC) mitochondria\nD) only A and C are correct\nE) A, B, and C are correct
Ahh, but the ribosomes that are found in chloroplasts and mitochondria are both  very similar to bacterial ribosomes because both chloroplasts and mitochondria evolved from prokaryotic cells, according to the endosymbiotic theory.  So, without doing the research to find out for sure, I'd guess that E would be the best answer."

"can you tell me about wheat grass and what it does?
I started taking a shot(1oz.) of wheatgrass with my fruitsmoothie about 4 months ago. I have a noticeable loss of weight and an increase in my appetite for food and my energy level has got higher. I don't feel as sick as I have been feeling before I started taking the shots of wheatgrass.
* a grass of the genus Agropyron\n      wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn\n\n    * Wheatgrass refers both to a plant of the genus Agropyron, as well as a puportedly nutritious and healthful drink made from its pulped sprouts.\n      en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatgrass\n\n\n\nWheatgrass Juice Benefits\n\nSo, what is it about chlorophyll that may be responsible for wheatgrass juice benefits?\n\nWell, for staters, chlorophyll contains a high amount of oxygen, and oxygen is crucial to our brain and body.\n\nSecond, chlorophyll may inhibit the development of certain bacteria.\n\nThird, some argue that chlorophyll helps remove toxins from the body and may, therefore, help improve the health of the liver.\n\nOne of the biggest wheatgrass benefits that is claimed by some is its ability to improve blood sugar levels.\n\nIt's important to also note that wheatgrass contains such ingredients as active enzymes, vitamins, and more. Therefore, it is hard to know what is truly responsible for the benefits of wheatgrass. Most likely, it's a combination of everything.\nWheatgrass Juice Benefits\nMost reported wheatgrass benefits are wheatgrass juice benefits since this is arguably the most effective way to consume large amounts of it.\n\nSome reported wheatgrass juice benefits include: helping keeping hair from become dry; mitigating skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis, improving poor digestion, helping hypertension, and boosting hemoglobin production.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most significantly, some people claim that wheatgrass juice benefits include the possibility of helping fight cancer.\n\nWhether this is true or not we don't know until clinical studies are conducted, but wheatgrass may harbor similar properties to that of certain vegetables that have been attributed anti-cancer properties."

"Why do we as a whole sometimes forget the tru meaning of Christmas and Easter?

Because there is no ""True meaning"".  The celebration of xmas is supposed to represent the birth of jesus, but no one knows when that actually happened (some even question the existence of the man, but that is another subject).\n\n""Easter"" is actually the ""goddess of fetility"" and she represented ""life returning"" in the spring (after the cold dark winter 'death').\n\nBoth xmas and Easter started as pagan rites/rituals and traditions to celebrate ""the return of the sun"" after darkness of winters.  xmas was the birthday of a pagan god (I do not recall the name presently), and when the pagan leaders switched to christianity, they kept the rites and holidays, only switched the meaning to match their 'new god' (jesus).\n\nXmas was actully the ""yule time"" when they went out and got the largest log they could find and burned it for days to bring light back.  It was a HUGE celebration with lots of sex, drinking and partying.  In fact in early American history (when the Puritans were still in charge) xmas was BANNED - because it was such a huge drinking/sex/party.\n\nHow it is celebrated now has only been around for less than 100 years - not really much of a tradition in the sense of its ""true meaning"".  Its not a celebration of spring, not a celebration of light, not a big party (though there is still drinking by a few).  Easter, also is not celebrated by honoring the goddess whose name it holds, but the symbols of rabbits and eggs (symbols of fertility and new life) are still in the picture.\n\nThe problem, again, is the ""real"" meaning has been skewed by christians (xians) and so you don't even know that you don't know the true meaning yourself."

"What is the locality and non-locality principles mean? And what is the EPR paradox?

Locality is the idea that you can describe small parts of the universe without reference to everything else in the universe.  For example, I can describe the collision of two pool balls without having to include forces from the planet Jupiter in my calculations.  Locality has become mixed up with the idea that there is a finite speed of causality.  Supposedly, non-local influences would act instantaneously at a distance.  (although thats not necessarily true)  The EPR paradox was a thought experiment proposed by Einstein, Rosen, and Pedolsky to illustrate what they percieved as a conceptual flaw in the quantum theory.  Most such paradoxes arose because the old physicists held on to a classical deterministic philosophy."

I've been doing crunches, sit-ups the common exercise but i have to limit myself since i had c-section. I haven't try any diet pills because i have second thoughts about it.
I personally haven't had a baby, but cardio at the gym does wonders when you want to lose inches. Eliptical trainers will do it fast. I've lost lots of weight that way and I know others who have lost baby fat that way also. It's the fastest healthiest thing I know to do.

"what type of doctor should one consult regarding weight problems?

Contrary to popular belief we as doctors do not receive much training in regards to weight management. There is no one specialist that I would recommend. Unless you were one of the few people affected by medical abnormalities causing weight problems you would be better off consulting other types of experts in the field. If there are weight issues you want to deal with you are best to consult a nutritionist. This is their area of specialization. Hope this helps."
"what are the causes of low albumin level?

What is albumin?\nAlbumin is a protein manufactured by the liver. \n\n\nWhat does albumin do?\nAlbumin performs many functions including maintaining the ""osmotic pressure"" that causes fluid to remain within the blood stream instead of leaking out into the tissues. \n\n\nWhat diseases cause albumin to be too low?\nLiver disease, kidney disease, and malnutrition are the major causes of low albumin. A diseased liver produces insufficient albumin. Diseased kidneys sometimes lose large amounts of albumin into the urine faster than the liver can produce it (this is termed nephrotic syndrome). In malnutrition there is not enough protein in the patient's diet for the liver to make new albumin from. \n\n\nWhat is a normal level of albumin?\nThe normal value depends on the laboratory running the test. Most labs consider roughly 3.5 to 5 grams per deciliter to be normal. \n\nWhat happens if it gets too low?\nIn a healthy person with normal nutrition, the liver will simply manufacture more and the level will normalize. If albumin gets very low swelling can occur in the ankles (edema) and fluid can begin to accumulte in the abdomen (ascites) and in the lungs (pulmonary edema). \n\nHow can you make the albumin higher?\nThe person must return to health. Therefore the underlying disorder must be corrected. If the disorder is cirrhosis of the liver, the only way to correct low albumin is generally to have a liver transplant. \n\n\nWhy does albumin fluctuate so much?\nAlbumin levels are also dependant on the state of hydration of the body. A person that is deficient of water (""dry"") because of dehydration will have an artificially low albumin level. This returns to normal when the dehydration is corrected. Albumin fluctuates so widely because it is very sensitive to changes in hydration of the body."

As a child did you play with mostly white dolls or black dolls?\nwhen answering can you please state your race. \nDid you have any choice in what colour your dolls were or did your parents buy them without first asking your preference?
I am white and had all white dolls. I don't think it was really my choice or not my choice it was my parents bought me. My dad was really raciest and my mom is a little so they never would of bought me a black doll. I think the closest I got to something besides a white doll was a Hawaii one. \n\nMy dad didn't really want me having black friends either so the doll issue was not that big to me. \n\nMy dad never once spoke to my husband because he is not white he is Arab. Sad to because my husband is a good man. I am happy my dads views didn't rub off on me. \n\nIf I am ever blessed with a girl, I will let her choose what ever doll she wants.

"if a teen is depressed and he knows it, should he tell anyone?
he is afraid to seek help, and feels family and friends can't help anymore.  would i he be less of a burden to his family if he just lets things take its course instead of having his (already financially stressed) family pay for psychiatrists and all that junk?
Yes you should tell someone, and it may not require all that. You may just need to supplement your diet or go to a dr. and get some medicine.  I was terribly depressed a year ago and was prescribed Prozac. It really helped and costed only about $8 a month (generic), so don't let yourself get all overwhelmed. You can get help.. affordable help. Search online for motivational sites or go to a bookstore and look through the self help section until you find something that sounds like it's speaking to you. It is hard being a teenager, your hormones are out of control and you're trying to find your place in life but remember... this too shall pass.  Trust me... if you think your family is stressed and burdened now... a missing or dead family member is not going to make their life better. You need to find a purpose, something that makes you feel good about yourself. Please don't give up.. I promise it will get better.  I am living proof!!"

"Can you get to where you are going if every step you take takes you half of the way there? It's Greek to me.

The easy answer is no, you would never get there.\n\nBut if you take quantum physics into effect, there is a point when the distance remaining between you and your destination is too small to measure and you might as well be there.\n\nThere is a length called a ""Planck Length"" which is equal to about 1.6160(12) E-35 meters, smaller than this, and your measurement doesn’t have any meaning.  This length is EXTREAMLY small, and when I say extremely, I mean EXTREMELY SMALL.  To give you a sense of this length....an atom has a diameter on the scale of Angstroms (E-10 meters), so a Plank Length would be on the order of 1/10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 th of an atom's diameter. [I dont know why Yahoo answers cuts off my number and puts ... on it, but it should be a 1 with 25 zeros after it]\n\nAnother things, thanks to the Heisenberg uncertainly principle, the more accurately you know your position (i.e. the distance you are away from the destination), the less you know about your velocity.  So if you KNOW you are EXACTLY 1/2 the distance between your starting point and your destination, you have absolutely no idea how fast you’re traveling.\n\nI have severely over complicated the problem."

Whether it's between a man and woman or a man and a man, love is the most beautiful thing this world has to offer.\n\nSome of the best parents I've known were gay who had adopted children whose real parents didn't want them and giving them a home and a family. Just because they aren't adding to an already overpopulated planet doesn't mean that they aren't contributing, quite the opposite actually. \n\nNow to address marriage, well that's you crazy fundamentalists denying gays rights.

"What is the Encyclical Letter of John Paul II On The Hundredth Annivaersary of Rerum Novarum?
explain it chapter by chapter, if possible. I need it for a Theology class!
Quick summary.  I hope it helps.\n\nIn structure, the new Encyclical begins with a description of the historical situation which prevailed in 1891, the emergence of hyper-industrialism, the accelerated division of Western societies into rich and poor, the spirit of revolution, based largely, but not exclusively, on class war and Marxist philosophy.\n\nJohn Paul II then outlines the essential principles promulgated by his predecessor - among them, the natural right to the ownership of private property (and the limit placed on that right); the right of workers to form trade unions and of employers to form parallel organisations; the right to an adequate period of rest, recreation, safe and hygienic conditions of work; the right to a just wage (sufficient for an entire family) guaranteed by the State; the right to religious freedom. Those rights, says John Paul II, are as unchallangeable today as they were then.\n\nThe latter is a not-unimportant point in present day Australia and New Zealand where, under the slogan of the ""de-regulation of labour"" (allegedly to complement the preceding de-regulation of the financial exchanges), the real purpose is not so much to limit the power of the unions according to law, but to smash them.\n\nThe third section of the new Encyclical traces the social history of Western societies since World War II, which the Pope characterises as ""a situation of non-war rather than genuine peace!"" Of this the main features were the loss of freedom of half the European continent to Communist totalitarianism; the consequent vast flow of refugees and of other migrants; the arms race whose economic cost alone made it impossible to realise many aspects of social justice; terrorism and counter-terrorism, de-colonisation.\n\nThe third chapter of the Encyclical is entitled ""The Year 1989"", the decisive turning-point, marked by the collapse of the Communist bloc ""accomplished almost everywhere by means of peaceful protest, using only the weapons of truth and justice!"" Nobody, writes the Pope, ever believed that the overthrow of the Communist empire could have been achieved by anything short of war. He rightly adds, however, that the inefficiencies of the Communist social and economic system, based on a denial of the right to property and freedom of production was a major contributing factor to the result.\n\nReligious roots\nWhat, in the end, overthrew the Communist system, however, was the indomitable urge of a new generation which knew that it had been robbed of any knowledge of the meaning of life and wished to regain ""the religious roots of their national cultures ... and the person of Christ Himself."" Here, it is possible to believe that the Pope has perhaps generalised too widely from forces he observed - and helped to create - in Poland.\n\nThe Pope does not make the mistake of believing that this is the happy ""end of history"", as the American writer, Francis Fukuyama put it: ""Much hatred and ill-will have accumulated. There is a real danger that these will re-explode after the collapse of dictatorship."" The condition of near civil war in Yugoslavia, as well as the many ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union would serve as illustrations to fill in the Pope's picture.\n\nThe dangers which the Pope foresees are of a possible revival of totalitarian controls, the domination of new societies by consumerist practices, and the rise of religious fundamentalism, which is perhaps natural granted the apocalyptic nature of the age.\n\nAs for remedies, the Pope went back to apply the principles of Rerum Novarum to a completely new and highly technological age.\n\n(1) The right of private property is insisted upon as the foundation of economic well-being and progress, to be accompanied however by measures which will share the proceeds in the interest of relieving poverty and distress.\n\n(2) This qualification is all the more necessary, since the explo"

Yikes is probably the correct response. Your friend sounds like an entrepreneur, in a negative way.

"Where can I get health insurance at low cost in Colorado?

it depends on what type of policy you want.  If you do a search on a site like insuranceshoppers.net, you'll find some REALLY cheap options on through some more expensive options that would be a waste of money.  But there is a reason the cheapest ones are so cheap, because they have really low limits (calendar year, outpatient, Rx, etc) or don't have any coverage at all in some areas.  The best thing to do is to choose one of the companies you have heard of and get a high deductible plan that still covers everything like Rx.  Call the agency to help you out, it doesn't cost anything.  In the end, it's all just a gamble - like going to Vegas.  If you are healthy and don't know what is going to happen in the future, you'll more than likely come out ahead by saving money in premiums with a high deductible plan or HSA qualified plan.  If you have pre-existing conditions and can't get individual (underwritten) health insurance in Colorado, you might check Cover Colorado - covercolorado.org"

in about 4 months plzz help me! thanks
Losing 28 pounds safely and permanently should take at least 3 months (2 pounds/week), and VERY few people can do that without gaining it back. That would be a very unusual pace. \n\nMore common is the 1 pound/week pace, which puts 28 pounds at about 6 months. \n\nOf course, all this depends on how overweight you are. If they're your LAST 28 pounds, it's much more difficult that the first 28 pounds. \n\nBe patient. Do it right. Diet and exercise."

Not necissarily on the Sci-Fi channel... but i would really love a job like that. i love traveling and im always looking for good ghost tours when i go to new places. \n\nim being serious, how do i get a career in this? what kind of schooling does it take, if any. and who can i contact about getting into this field?
You would probably want to study parapsychology.  Parapsychologists study ghosts, ESP, dreams, etc.\n\nYou can get a list of universities that offer degrees in parapsychology by emailing the American Association for Parapsychology at info@parapsychologydegrees.com.  and requesting information on degree programs in parapsychology.\n\nGood luck!"
"What can I do with a finance major? and what is the starting salary right out of college?

Starting salary will largely depend on where you live.  The same job in Columbus OH will pay a great deal less than New York City due to the higher cost of living.\n\nWith a finance major there are many opportunities.  Take a look at the 100 Best Companies to Work list and look at a few of those companies websites.  Get into a good company with a good training program and your possibilities are endless.  Even if you don't like the big corporate world, the training will be invaluable.  You can take that to any other type of job.\n\nYou could go into insurance, treasury, financial analysis, investing, hedge funds.  The list is endless.  You've picked a good major.\n\nOne good thing is probably to figure out where you want to live and work.  Find a good head hunter in the area and they might help.  Robert Half is a good one for finance/IT majors.  Try them.  They're located in many cities."
"Express the inequality using interval notation.  x>=10?
Note:  If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the ""union"" symbol, (u).  If needed enter infinity and -infinity.
x>=10  draw the number line\n\n<...8...9...10------> x is everything to the right of 10 all the way up to infinity, and since it is greater than or EQUAL to, it also includes 10.  That would make it a closed interval on the left side [10,infinity)\n\nNote that +/- infinity are always open intervals, since you never reach them."
"can someone tell me what i can do to help get developed abs fast?
i know about crunches but isn't there anything more effective?
In order to have good abs you MUST have a low body fat level, at the least in the single digits.  If you have too much bodyfat, then you can have the biggest abs in the world, but they won't show up because the fat sits on top of the muscle.  So diet and cardio are both crucial if you want to have great abs.\n\nAs far as exercising goes, abs are tricky.  You need to make sure that you are doing the exercises with good form.  90% of all people do ab exercises wrong.  It's way to easy to use the hip flexors instead of the abdominals.  Proper crunches will work the abs, while sit-ups mainly work the hip flexors.  Check the link below for good instructions on different ab exercises.\n\nFinally make sure you are doing exercises for each of the different muscles that make up the whole ""abs"" ... the upper abs, the lower abs, and the obliques.  Good luckl!!!"
"How long would it take me to lose 4 kilos if i ate 1000cals a day and skipping (with a rope) for 1 hour a day?
Would it take more than 2 months?
It all depends on your weight and the calories your body needs to function.  Remember that 1 pound = 3500 calories.  So if your only taking in 1000 calories a day and exercising (may I suggest maybe running or aerobics rather than jumping rope) it should only take a month or so."

"what are the best websites for info on the satanic church and thier religion?

Your mind really. We make up religion to suit our needs. No real proof exist for symbols of good nor evil. This is why both sides of the coin exist. We simply do not know and remain mystified or in question. Both religions based on evil or good as forces percieved by humanity. Now to answer your question-at least go for a Druid religion or Wicca. It is realistic. Type in Wicca.com. Our minds are still in early stages of evolution. What you imagine or perceive can be amplified to the extent you create proof. I will tell you this: it is all tail chasing if you seek some organization to belong to. You will be manipulated. You search for power in numbers perhaps, or some unity to acknowledge your belief. Look into yourself. The web site is in your heart, honestly. In the end, you will find that wisdom and knowledge are released with spiritual insight and evil negates this. I truly know this first hand. Do as you may, but do not hurt others unless they hurt you in a real way with malific intent."
"My sister has cervical cancer, is she going to die?
Im worried about her. What am I to expect for the next few monthes or years? Is there a cure for this?
Please speak to her oncologist about it.  He is the only one who can tell you what is going to happen and what the treatment options will be for her.  You can visit when your sister attends and ask all the questions you have then.\n\nGive your sister the most support you can because she really needs it and she'll appreciate it so much.  Cancer patients are so fragile and scared themselves so you need to be thinking about the future for them and letting them know how much you care and are excited to share it with them.\n\nFact is that cancer progresses in stages and the earlier it is discovered, the easier a time the patient will have either getting rid of it entirely or getting it under control:\n  \n- Getting rid of it entirely is difficult but could allow her to return to a pretty much normal life assuming an operation was successful at getting all the cancerous cells.  \n\n-Keeping it under control depends on a persons genetics and how they react to the drug treatments and can decrease life expectancy to only a number of years, although it can happen that a normalish life (outside the drugs/hormone treatment) could be possible.\n\nSorry for your news, cancer takes front and center stage whenever it appears."
"urethra burn - please help?
ITs kinda embarasing- i often get a burning sensation in my penis(urethra) and sumtimes when u'm peeing. What could cause this and how can i stop it even though it is very sporadic and lasts only a short time. could masterbating be causing it?
Contrary to the impressions of the other answerers, it is not only possible but LIKELY that teenage masturbation is causing this burning sensation.  Erectile tissue does not fully mature until the body has reached ~25 years; overexertion of the penis and urethra before full maturity can definitely have adverse effects on the short-term and long-term health of the genitals."

like glass vibrates. can liquids do the same? maybe at some weird frequency or somehthing? i dono
all of the molecules in a liquid are always vibrating. That's why the material isn't solid--the connections between the molecules are so weak that the vibrate and flow past each other all the time.

"Rainbow Physics - why does light escape?
Okay, this question concerns how rainbows are formed, specifically, with regard to how the light escapes from the water droplet.\n\nJust follow along with me for a second:\nLight enters the raindrop and gets refracted. It then hits the outer wall of the raindrop and gets totally internally reflected because the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle.\n\nMy question is why does the totally internally reflected ray ever escape? If you were to draw the radii to the points where the rays hit the surfaces of the rain drop then by basic geometry (isosceles triangle formed by two radii) the angle of incidence when the ray hits the surface of the raindrop for the second time will be exactly the same as for the first time, and hence will still be greater than the critical angle. As far as I can see, this is true no matter how many reflections occur. \n\nSo how does the light ray ever escape?\n\nI hope someone can point out where i'm going wrong.
You must to review the diagram... note that the light escape in a second reflection, no in the first reflection."

"Any good ideas to control localized psoriasis on my hand?

I've been fighting psoriasis (very NON-localized!) for about four years now. \n\nBecause I sunburn so easily, my dermatologist has told me I should probably avoid it, but he usually tells psoriasis patients to get direct sunlight on the affected area for about 15 to 20 minutes a day.  \n\nI've used several prescription ointments (Donovex [vitamin D] and clobetasol propionate [a topical steroid]) with only moderate success.  Cyclosporan capsules gave me sleep apnea (which, fortunately, stopped when I quit taking them!). Light therapy (before I found my current dermatologist!) made a ""crispy critter"" out of me and made the problem about five times worse! My new doctor gave me a prescription for Soriataine pills, which I haven't had filled yet. I read about the side effects and decided to try something else first!\n\nAbout two and a half weeks ago I started using ""Cocoon"" Total Body Rejuvenating Emollient from AminoGenesis ($44 a bottle - lasts me about 12 days putting it on both legs and both arms, and assorted other spots twice a day!), which is expensive until you compare it to the prescription drugs usually used for psoriasis! It feels wonderful going on, smells nice, absorbs well, and isn't sticky. It works very slowly, but it's completely non-toxic (Hallelujah!), which cannot be said for ANY of the prescription meds I've used or been encouraged to try. My spots and patches are paler than they were when I started, and I'm starting to see small areas of skin that are almost normal skin color on my lower legs (where my psoriasis is so thick it looks like I'm wearing burgundy knee socks!). I'm going to give this stuff at least a 2-month trial. It is keeping my skin moisturized enough that I've not had a problem (so far) with flaking. It does nothing for the itching, but then neither have any of the other things I've tried! I ordered it from http://www.dermagirl.com  ... they offer free shipping and free samples with every order ... and their prices for this are the same as half a dozen other sites I checked. \n\nGood luck!

"Why didnt Einstein get a nobel prize for (e=mc2) but for his photo electric effect?

Yeh, interesting question.  Here is a good response, taken from the Boston Globe:\n\nSort of, but as is so often the case, it's a little more subtle than a simple yes/no answer.\n\nEinstein did receive the Nobel prize in physics in 1921, and the actual citation from the Nobel committee was ''for services to Theoretical Physics, and especially of the law of the photoelectric effect.""\n\nDuring 1905 alone Einstein probably made enough scientific leaps to justify three Nobel prizes, writing several papers that would change the world. Certainly the case could be made that he should have had several more for work done afterward, but most people like to think of that year as ''the big one"" that made certain he would get a Nobel prize no matter what.\n\nOne 1905 paper dealt with the ''photoelectric effect"" and is the work that was clearly cited for the prize. In this work he showed that, although most scientists believed light acted like a wave, one must also at times treat light as being made of little chunks of electromagnetic energy called photons. This was the beginning of the strange subject of quantum mechanics which made it essential to drop many preconceived notions of what made sense in order to really understand how the world worked.\n\nAnother paper of 1905 introduced Einstein's special theory of relativity (special in that it could not deal with acceleration, but only with constant velocity's) and introduced the radical idea of merging space and time into one thing: space-time.\n\nYet another 1905 paper showed that one could infer the existence of atoms -- something still controversial at the time -- by looking at the random motion of grains of pollen in a drop of water.\n\nEinstein kept working to develop his general theory of relativity, which extended the special theory to include acceleration and gravity, but this took a bit of time to get sorted out -- it was published in 1915 and introduced the idea of curved space-time.\n\nThis list of achievements is nowhere near complete, but space restrictions make me stop here.\n\nMany people feel that the Nobel committee wanted to hedge its bets a bit by just picking out just one of the mind-blasting 1905 breakthroughs (which were all still controversial 15 years later) and lumping the rest together as ''Theoretical Physics."" Oddly enough, it's the ideas of quantum mechanics, ushered in by the Nobel-cited photoelectric effect paper, that are perhaps the most controversial today!"

most of us say the characteristic parts of our zodiac signs descriptions are true. would we say this is if our descriptions were switched with other signs'? in other words,do we really just say the descriptions fit us because we unconsciously want them to? or do all of the descriptions fit us?
Horoscope columns just deal with generalities of the sun sign.  A REAL horoscope chart is calculated uniquely for each person and no two people have the same chart.  REAL astrology is a lot more complicated and each person has 3 different signs, a sun sign is based on birth date, a rising sign based on the birth time, (hour and minute), and the moon sign based on birth date and time.  A person's sun sign characteristics are modified depending on their rising and moon signs along with other factors.  A REAL horoscope chart calculates the placement of the planets when you were born, the signs they were in and the houses they fall into in your natal chart, (which has 12 houses and rules different areas of your life), along with the aspects each planet makes to other planets and important angles of your chart.  This gives you your natal chart that tells about you specifically, your looks, personality, abilities, family, spouse etc.\n\nPredictions are based on the positions of your natal planets in comparison to transits.  Transits are where the planets are located on the current day and the aspects they make to your natal planets and houses of your birth chart."

"Why can't muslim women marry non-muslim men?

because if the father of their kids were non muslim it is most likely that they become non muslim too ... so here we just lost a family of Islam to a non muslim ones\n\n\nIslam considers the husband head-of-the-family and therefore requires that a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim because she will be under the authority of a non-muslim husband. He may\nprevent her from carrying out her religious obligations by either pressuring her or physically abusing her. But it is not the sole reason for imposing the restriction. The situation is\nconsidered very damaging for the woman to practise Islam afterwards and even worse for the kids in such marriages.  There are NO conditions mentioned under which a Muslim woman IS allowed to get married or remain married to a non-Muslim husband\nafter she has accepted Islam. Therefore, even if she has freedom to practice Islam after marriage, she is NOT allowed to enter into an inter-faith marriage."

You can fly be on your own 1000 foot yacht, or have any woman (or man or whatever you like)...There are good dreams and terrifying dreams, nightmares where you fall off abridge or monsters are chasing you. Pretty much ANYTHING can happen in dreamland, right?\n\nWell LSD is a chemical that tricks the brain into thinking it is asleep and triggers the part of the brain that allows you to dream, but you are awake. This is a very very powerful and potentially dangerous situation. Imagine having the ability of to dream while you are walking around. You get hallucinations your brain plays tricks on you and you may have trouble distinguishing between reality. This is problematic when trying to accomplish such mundane tasks as crossing the street....\n\nTo answer the question, it may not have lasting effects but while you are under the influence the line between reality and not will be very fuzzy and perhaps invisible. This can get you hurt or allow you to have a terrible nightmare that you can't  awaken from since you ALREADY ARE AWAKE!\n\nThe other side of the coin is also true. You may have a beautiful experience. Most people can handle it, but then MAYBE NOT...................then don't look into the mirror."

I have moments where I go into another world.My eyes will get big and start swallowing hard,say stupid things and dont remember having them.Never have experinced one.My mind has started wandering.I can be watching tv or working and my mind is somewhere else.Went to doctor and he said they were like ceasars. He put me on some medicine (trileptal).Didnt have one for 2 weeks and then had one.i would like to know if this is ceasars or something else.I'm out of work for 1 month with this. i thought it was taken care of until I had one last night
That really doesn't sound like seizures to me. I'd get a second opinion."
"how do i start investing in the philippines with a small amount of money?
I graduated last year. I started working about 5 months ago. I was able to save a small amount of money, and I want it to work for me. I want to start early so I hope you could give me some answers. Should I go into mutual funds? What are my other options?
The first thing you should do is make sure you have around 6 months living expenses in an at call bank account. Even though this money isn't working as hard as stock investments would, it should be the foundations for your financial freedom. Once you have that in place you should then look at funds. There are funds and ETF's that focus on the Philippines, the best way to evaluate them is to look at the one with the least fees, past performance is rarely a good indicator of future performance, especially in a diversified portfolio. \n\nYou are, at this stage in your life, much better off investing your savings in training and personal development so that you can get a better job and eventually start your own business. These really are the paths to financial freedom."
"why can't jehovah's witnesses have blood transfusions?
its for homework
They can, but through faith choose not to.  It should be mentioned that only 13% of those refusing blood are witnesses.  The Bible says the blood is the soul, so by taking a blood transfusion, you are infusing someone else's soul into yourself.  The Bible also teaches not to take in blood.\n\nMany great medical achievements have happened as a result of their refusals.  Doctors had to develop methods to avoid excess blood loss, always a good idea.  UCLA now does bloodless liver transplants.  \n\n100% of people taking blood experience side affects.  Blood transfusions lowers the immunal response, with large transfusions used to shut down the immune system for transplants.  The immunal response is a lot like that of AIDS.  If you get sick after a transmission, its with a rare illness, not a common one.\n\nIn England, the blood supply is no longer considered safe, due to mad cow disease.  Anyone under 18 can only receive a transfusion of blood imported from America."
"How come atheist and others who have more faith in science always.............................................
want to scientifically disprove christianity, but are  never bold enough to challenge the muslim faith? For instance, isn't the stone that the muslims in Mecca say is holy and was once a white stone, but it turned black because of the sins of man, that they bow down to a meteorite? It has been scientifically proven that it has the same composition as a meteorite, so, why do they worship it, since they believe in 1 God, and not worshipping idols? Isn't worshipping a thing like a meteorite an idol? And before you start on christians, I don't go to the Vatican church in Rome, I'm not catholic, therefore I pray to no one but God. I don't worship dead saints, or the mother mary. Just God alone. And I am a christian!!!!!!
OK, I will venture an opinion on the reason those who believe in evolution are primarally attacking The Bible, and those who believe it in it's entirety.\n1. If the Bible is true (and it is) and God created us in a literal six day period, then we have a responibility to Him.\n(a) Muslims do not have detailed information about the creation from the Qur'an, for that, they too must turn to the Bible.\n(b) only a literal reading of the creation account is offensive to the evolutionists, so since the Muslims regard the Bible as ""corrupted"", they could easily buy into the idea that god created the world through evolution.\n\n2. You only attack that which presents a real threat to you.\nevolution first and foremost uses the same trick the serpent used in the garden - questioning the valididty of God's word.\n(a) Muslims also question the validity of the Bible, and so evolution and Islam ar not at odds on this issue.\n(b) The Qur'an does not pose a direct threat to evolution - the Bible does.\n\nThere are more things than just the Kaa'ba stone that suggest idolotry in Islam.\n1. The fact that speaking against Muhommad is considered a ""shirk"" (blasphemy) suggests that Muhommad has been exalted to the level of deity within Islam. (note the violent uprisings due to certain recent depictions of this individual in a certain newspaper.)\n2. The (supposed) eternal existence of the Qur'an and it's infalibility, combined with the undue reverence for the book itself (as opposed to Allah) could be arguably considered idolotry.\n3. Despite (internal) claims to the contrary, the majority of the Muslims on the planet actually practice some form of idolotry (in which the worship of a local 'god' is mixed with the worship of Allah).\n4. The Kaaba stone was a place of worship long before the time of Muhommad, and he merely changed some of the external trappings of the same form of worship."
"Do you have any tips for getting an earring through a partially closed hole?
My little girl just got her ears pierced and they seemed to have begun to close up. They've been pierced for a few months but she left them out for a day and now the back of the hole seems closed while the front is ok. Should I just ice it and push the piercing stud through? Any ideas?
Get an insertion taper from a reputable piercer. The insertion taper is used to stretch the hole, instead of creating another wound by repiercing."

"Nautralizing a Solution, 2 parts, 1st part answered.?
How many mL of 0.30M HCl(aq) are needed to neutralize a solution of 238.50mL of 1.35M barium hydroxide?\nANSWER is 2.1×10^3\n\nNow here is part of the question I need help with:\n\nCalculate the molarity of the chloride ion ion present in the solution that results from mixing the proper volume of HCl (aq) with the solution of barium hydroxide specified in the preceding problem.
Well lots of chemistry questions lately....finals coming up? :)  Good Luck!!!  \n\nTo calculate this type of question first of all calculate the #of moles of HCl used.  So \nyou used 2100 mL = 2.1 L HCl \nThis HCl is 0.3 mol/L so you used:\n\n2.1 L HCl* (0.3 mol HCl/L) = 0.63 mol HCl\n\nnow use the ratio of Cl/HCl  (which is 1 to 1)\n\n0.63 mol HCL *(1mol Cl/1mol HCl)= 0.63 mol Cl ion\n\nSo far so good I hope.  \n\nNow do your solution diltion to calculate volume,\n2.1L + .2385L = 2.3385 L of mixed solution\n\nNow simply divide \n0.63 mol Cl/2.3385 L solution = 0.269 mol Cl ion in final solution.\n\nAgain these numbers are quick and dirty but the method of solving this type of problem is the same."
"Am planning to buy a property worth RS 20 Lacs through loan.?
The propertyalready  has loan of RS 15 lakhs exists on it.\nAnd owner of the property has repaid about 2 lakhs towards the  loan and remaining loan exists.\nOwner of the property is telling me to transfer the loan directly to my name and giving remaining amount in hot cash.\nCan i transfer the Existing loan to my name, or make the owner to repay the full amount towards loan  then i buy the property.\nWhich is better?.
Dear .... \n\nI am a Real Estate consultant from Pune\n\nIf the Property Already has loan on the title. ( Which bank) , The Title is existing with that bank.\n\nAre u Applying for a Loan  \n\nThen your bank will give the balance amount Directly to the Sellers bank. \n\n2 Lacs paid till date Out of that how much principal is paid , Ask your seller to give you a Total out Standing statement from his Bank , which will make your picture Clear.  In the Initial Years maximum repayment is done towards interest only, so chances of principal coming down is low. \n\nNo banks will give you loan in your name, generally Home Loans are given Directly to the Seller if no Dues are there on his property, If any Banks have got any loan to that property they will first clear the amount and then the balance is given to the Owner. Like for eg If he is selling u the property at 20 lacs and 14 lacs is out standing to bank according to Outstanding statement by the Sellers bank . balance of Rs 6 lacs will be given to the Seller after he clear the Dues from his bank and hands over all the Original Documents which are kept as a mortgage with the Sellers bank. After Receiving the Original property Docs your bank will Give the balance amount to you as bankers cheque / DD in owners name only. \n\nYou are talking about existing loan transfer in your name : in Bank terms they close one account and open a new account for you , If you have Got your financial Docs in Order and bank is ready to give you loan then u can do the take over , Talk to that bank about this offer of yours. Approach some local bank , or Big MNC brands the loan office / sales guy will guide you better. \n\nTransfer to your name . No bank will give you loan with out security of property which the Title is already lying with sellers bank. How can u take loan on that, If you have some other property or some asset to mortgage then you can work that out.\n\nPlease Consult a Lawyer in your location, Show him all property details and take his suggestion before proceeding in this deal  \n\nThanks\n\nShaji Thomas\nshaji@worldpls.com"
"Ethical and compassionate people:  Would you suddenly become evil if Christianity did not exist?

There is only GOOD.  All things that appear to be evil are really teaching us something for our personal growth.  Christianity exists to help folks grow.  It helps them see that even though they practice a certain religion, they are no closer to the truth.  If anything, they become disillusioned by all the lies.  But, again, they ""grow"" through that and eventually come to the ""bliss"" they forgot.\n\nWe are not human beings having a spiritual experience.  We are Spiritual beings having a human experience.  :)\n\nP.S.  Since we all have the capacity for good and negative choices, we can't really throw stones.  However, most ""Christians"" I have met, seem to be more hateful and unkind than others.  It shows it takes more than a commonly accepted belief system to make a true difference in our attitudes and actions.  :)"
"SHARES - buying and selling?
I`m interested in the buying and selling of shares.  Where is the best place to start dealing in the stock market ?
Congratulations on getting started. It’ll help you more than you know!\n\nHow to invest depends on what you already know. We'll assume that you're beginning.\n\nA good primer is How to Make Money in Stocks by William O'Neil. You can get it cheap just about anywhere. It’s widely available new or used.\n\nAnother good one is one of Jim Cramer's books. \n\nBut books will only get you so far. At some point, you'll also want to get at least a little training. There are some great education companies if you want to make the investment. Investools.com or optionetics.com are both very good companies as is tmitchell.com\n\nFor free, you can start by visiting thestreet.com. That'll get you a pretty good primer so at least you'll understand what the markets are and what a stock is, etc. If you get a chance, watch Mad Money on CNBC. Don't trade any of his picks. Just use the show to get you to understand some basics and get a feel for the market itself.\n\nNext, subscribe to something like investorsbusiness daily or something like that that can help you identify good stocks.\n\nDo a quick search (at the top of the page) on ROTH IRAs. You’ll want to put some money in there.\n\nOnce you understand stocks, go to 888options.com. It's a website that'll help you understand options (what they do, how they work, etc). You don't need to trade them, but the more you know, the more you'll see how options can really be the safest way to invest (once you're educated).\n\nAs you get more advanced, you might want a technical analysis book like Murphy's Visual Investor or A Technical Analysis Course by Meyer.\n\nIf it's discipline (which is crucial to successful trading), probably Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas or Mastering the Trade by John Carter\n\nI know that’s a LOT to absorb. Just take it one step at a time for now. Start slow, then as you figure things out, move out of mutual funds into ETFs and/or stocks.\n\nCongrats again on getting started. If you have any questions, please let me know. \n\nHope this helps!"

I do know that PCOS may make difficult for you to conceive, but it doesn't mean that you can't ever have children.\n\nThe disorder runs in my family, and I was told by my doctor that the best bet would be to stay on birth control pills until the time comes when I am ready to try to get pregnant. The hormones in the pills are supposed to slow the progress/development of the symptoms.\n\nYour doctor can do a symptom checklist to see if you fit the requirements for PCOS.

"Why is it a stereotype for lesbians to play softball?

A classic myth is that softball is full of lesbians - an idea that emerged from one of the great pillars of intelligence, the U.S. Army, which historically conducted its witchhunts for lesbians by heading for the softball games. \nIt is true that lesbians play softball, even lots of lesbians; but many straight women play softball too. In total softball gear, it is hard to tell who is this, that, or the other thing: They all look like softball players."

Not only is sign language not universal it differs from region to region in the US, sort of like dialects among speaking people.

"Do Violent Games, like gta, Influence teens To Become Murderers?
I must tell you that, lately, there has been a very violent murder in my city, Mty mex, where a teen killed 2 small children, who were his girlfriend's sister and brother, and nearly killed her too. And now the media has been attacking all the video games he had in his collection, especially the GTA.\n\nI have been playing video games for over 15 years now, an so far, I haven't killed anyone.
Yes and no but mostly no.  Some people that are susceptible to influence are likely to be influenced by almost anything.  There are religious fanatics that have killed others and even themselves; there are violent movies, books, family, and so on.  If we are to blame a video game, what is next?\n\nNow, it is easy to point a finger but that is just an excuse (the Twinkie defense).  There are those that will blame anything or anyone for their actions but themselves and as a society we must question our reactions.  Should we take the word or some psycho freak and blame someone else or make the psycho take responsibility for their actions?  I think you can probably tell where I stand.  If they have that little moral grounding or that shallow of a grasp on reality I think it is indicative of a larger problem, but they should still be the ones to burn, not the games :)"
"Can someone please explain the little cap Jewish men wear? Is there a significance to color?
I have seen men with black,white and I have even seen some that look like they are crochet.\n\nI ask this with the deepest most respect of wanting to know but did not want to ask out of fear of offending somone.
The cap is called a Yamicka and is used as a show of respect to God. The most common colors are black and white, but they can actually be any color or combo of colors. But a Rabbi alone wears only black or white all the time. In the Jewish faith it is important to cover the crown of the head, in that faith only God is 'King' so men cover their 'crown' out of respect to the one true 'King'."
"Is the Trinity ""one person""?

""Trinity"" is a term that is not found in the Bible but a word used to describe what is apparent about God in the Scriptures. The Bible clearly speaks of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit...and also clearly presents that there is only one God. Thus the term: ""Tri"" meaning three, and ""Unity"" meaning one, Tri+Unity = Trinity. It is a way of acknowledging what the Bible reveals to us about God, that God is yet three ""Persons"" who have the same essence of deity.\nSome have tried to give human illustrations for the Trinity, such as H2O being water, ice and steam (all different forms, but all are H2O). Another illustration is an egg having a shell, egg yolk and egg white, but this egg illustration shows that there would be ""parts"" to God, which isn't the case.\n\nGod the Son (Jesus) is fully, completely God. God the Father is fully, completely God. And God the Holy Spirit is fully, completely God. Yet there is only one God. In our world, with our limited human experience, it's tough to understand the Trinity. But from the beginning we see God this way in Scripture. Notice the plural pronouns ""us"" and ""our"" in Genesis 1:26 -- Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.""\n\nThough not a complete list, here is some other Scripture that shows God is one, in Trinity: \n\n""Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!"" (Deut. 6:4)\n\n""I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God."" (Isa. 45:5)\n\nThere is no God but one. (1Cor. 8:4)\n\nAnd after being baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him, and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, ""This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased."" (Matt. 3:16-17)\n\n""Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."" (Matt. 28:19)\n\nJesus said: ""I and the Father are one."" (John 10:30)\n\n""He who has seen Me has seen the Father."" (John 14:9)\n\n""He who beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me."" (John 12:45)\n\nIf anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. (Rom. 8:9)\n\n""Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."" (Matt. 1:20)\n\nAnd the angel answered and said to her [Mary], ""The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy offspring shall be called the Son of God."" (Luke 1:35)\n\n[Jesus speaking to His disciples] ""And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you, and will be in you."" ... ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him."" (John 14:16-17, 23)"

"how can i increase my appetite?

Well, the answer to this can vary widely based on several things. First, why do you need to eat more? Second, are you attempting to gain weight, if so, how much and why? Third, is this based on an illness or disease you have been afflicted with?\n\nSome people just naturally eat a lot, while others normally eat less. As I am unsure why you feel you need to eat more, I am unsure how to proceed other than to list all the general issues that could be related to loss of appetite.\n\nIf your plan is to gain weight, you don’t necessarily need to eat more, just change the types of food you eat. Include more fats and carbohydrates in your diet, and less fiber. Also, consider getting some Ensure from your doctor. Ensure and Ensure Plus are weight gaining supplements used in healthcare to nourish and put weight on to people with no or little appetites, such as people who have been starved, have an eating disorder, or have had a serious illness or disease. Ensure is also used a lot with the elderly, as when we age our body is not able to absorb nutrients as readily as when we are young. \n\nIf your lack of appetite is related to a health issue, consult with your doctor on how best to proceed. The doctor can help you work out a safe and healthy plan, and work with you to ensure your goals are met. I know there are some medications available out there that can increase appetite, these are often prescribed to people undergoing chemotherapy (for cancer), as chemo often causes people to lose their appetites. \n\nSmoking marijuana also increases appetite (THC, the chemical in pot that gets people 'high' also tricks the brain into thinking the body has an empty stomach and is hungry) However, I would not recommend smoking marijuana for a number of reasons, the foremost being it is illegal in most places. The other main reasons are the health hazards. Regardless of what popular belief says, I can tell you from a health care perspective (and a former pot smoker), that Marijuana is addictive, and it is dangerous to your health. It will increase your appetite, but it will also make you lethargic and prone to laziness, it costs a lot to smoke it every day, and it really does make people stupid- it slowly paralyzes then kills the cells in the higher reasoning centers of our brains. Also, smoking one decent sized joint or average sized blunt puts as many chemicals and carcinogens (cancer causing agents) into the lungs and bodies as 1-3 packs of cigarettes. That is why smoking marijuana is rarely recommended to anyone other than terminally ill patients.\n\nSometimes lack of an appetite can be brought on by an inactive or lethargic lifestyle. If you spend a lot of time sitting/lying down, start getting exercise on a daily basis- get out every day, take a walk. Start out small, just walk a few blocks. Gradually increase the distance, so after a month or two you are walking a couple miles each day. This regular exercise will increase your metabolism, there by increasing your appetite. I suggest walking as it is a low impact, low stress exercise than just about anyone can do. There are also many other health benefits to walking (and any regular exercise). Another good exercise is stair walking. My father walks up/down the staircase in his home 15-20 times, 3 times a day. This seems silly, but it is a good way to get some exercise.\n\nAnother thing to consider is your mental well being. Often times, people who have depression, bi-polar illness (aka manic depression), or an anxiety disorder (such as panic attacks or post traumatic stress disorder) often times find they have a suppressed appetite. Not every one who has a mental illness is aware they have it, nor do most people afflicted with mental illness act like the stereotypical mentally ill people we see on TV and in the movies. Consider getting a psychiatric evaluation, to see if you have a mental illness. There are many good medications out there that can both help with the illness and increa"
"do delta plan insurance cover adult braces?
...................................
Delta and almost all insurance companies have millions and millions of different plans.  Just because one Delta covers ortho does not mean your will.  The best thing to do is look on your insurance card to find the phone number.   Call them and ask the following questions:\n1.  Do you cover braces for adults?\n2.  If yes - at what percentage?\n3.  What is the deductible?\n4. Is there a maximum amount you will pay?\n5. DO you pay monthly or quarterly, or lump sum?\n6. Does the dental office need to file claims at every appointment, or only the first appointment?\n7.  Will i get a discount if i go to a dentist on your list of providers?\n\nThat will help you know how much they are Really going to pay.  Just because they say they cover braces doesn't mean they will pay 100%.  Be careful.  Also ask them if they will cover the Pre-ortho x-rays and impressions, and the retains after the ortho."
"TV watching as a lifestyle. What do you think of the affects?
The last one year I watched so many movies, I totally lost count. Average 5-10 a week.\nMy flatmate watches movies and series (friends, x-files, that70s show, south park, black adder......... a lot more) AVERAGE 4-6 HOURS A DAY. I also joined him 2-3 days a week, since I really coudn't do else in winter.\nI know several people that live the same and even, when they come to our place, the only thing they want to do is watch a movie.\n\nDo you know people, that watch TV this much?\nWhat affect you think it has on their (our) lives?
Television is not cool...no...Those who create television shows the majority of the time have some kind of psychology degree and they're more interested in manipulating you in some manner rather than educate you or give you pleasurable viewing...Control-control...that's all that television is here on this planet...It's an invention of basically less than 75 years...for the greater part of that most stations being government owned or controlled...Television, most of the time is very bad for an individual...People wasting living years and hours of days in front of the television being constantly manipulated be people...That's the problem, the greater majority of the population never had access to one and then all of a sudden there was a boom...especially in post war years...people should be out there living and communicating...they entice you with they're can you relate to this and that ...when in fact you're being manipulated by government psychologists who want a mind-frame for their region...Television is terrible and I don't like it much."
"What would happen if you left your job before the closing date?
I am about to close in a month (all signed etc ) with my new house, and I have been laid off!!  I was wondering what the consequences will be (if any).  I have great credit, down payment is there.. all in my agreement have been met - except the letter of employment.  thanks in advance.
I agree with the above poster. If you credit is good, you have other verifiable income you may be able to stay with the same lender; if your up front and honest. Just prior to funding the loan the funder is going to call your employer to verify your still there. Guess what happens when she finds out your gone? Loan dies and now your already at your closing date.\n\nIf you have a month to go before closing you have lots of time to find a solution. If your credit is as good as you say you may be able to go no doc (no income, no assets, no employment) or a no employment verification only but with verified assets etc...\n\nBe up front and honest and you should be ok.\n\nIf you would like to discuss some alternatives to your situation drop me a line.\n\nKevin 866-562-6838 x 106\nkruorock@firstratelending.com\nwww.firstratelending.com"
"Can ghosts have kids?

Theoretically, the answer would be no.  Since ghosts are nothing more than two-dimensional beings who have found a way towards some form of afterlife, there isn't the ""space"" inside them to have kids in the same form or fashion as we  have come to be used to in a three-dimensional world.\n\nThis does leave open the possibility that there is a way in which they can propogate, just not in the same way in which we are used to."

"I got a question about noble gas in a equilibrium system?
At constant pressure or/and constant volume \nwill it shift the equilibrium? Personally i think so- under some conditions\nBut i dont know why. \nCan anyone help me?
At constant pressure it wont. Noble gases are unreactive, thus cannot chemically disturb the equilibrium. \n\nAt constant volume, however the noble gas will. Remember that you are introducing more particles in the system, thus at constant volume the pressure will increase. This will shift the equilibrium of the reacting substances to the side with less gas particles to reduce the pressure. This is different, as the gas is PHYSICALLY disturbing the equilibrium.\n\nNeed more explanation?"

Where does it say this in the holy texts, I'm really curious as ""rockyroad"" seems very certain about it but didn't reveal his sources.
It is interesting that, with the exception of the Mormons (an off-shoot of the Christian religion), no major religion has been formed since the age of modern science. Think about it! All major religions were created before people knew that the Earth is round. There was one fellow in Texas that tried to start a new religion. His name was David Koresh. We know how that turned out."
"20/20 eyesight?
how do u tell if u have 20/20 eyesight without going to an eyedoctor?
Find someone you know who does have. Have them look at a far away tiny letter (not an object) and not the tiniest one they can see either. Just one that is pretty small and far away and that they can read fairly easily. Then, leave both of your eyes open but cover or block the view of one of your eyes and see if you can make it out. Then, do the same with the other eye--simply block its view and see if you can distinguish the small letter. You may be surprised.\nIf you are in school and want to test it, go to the nurses station or the place where they usually have the scales and stuff. Stand on the 20 ft. line and repeat the above process with the 20/20 line. Remember, DO NOT press against the blocked eye. Simply leave it open but block its view with the hand while looking at the lines with the unblocked eye."

"I'm on a calrie-reduced diet, plus exercise 4X a week but loss less than 1 pound a week-Help!?

Trying to lose weight is frustrating.  SO no matter what keep up the good work.  I know i can eat 1200 calories a day and work out high intensity for 2 hours a day 4 times a week, and still barely lose a pound - sometimes it doesn't make sense.\n\nSo my advice for you - first off keep it up.  As frustrating and hard as it is, it is worth it.  Also, remember the less you have to lose the harder it is.  Losing weight slowly is healthy, and you are more likely to keep it off having learned healthy habits, and have less nasty side affects, like oh, droopy skin.\n\nWhat you can do to try to lose weight is analize your diet.  Keep track online at a site like fitday.com or on paper of EVERYTHING that goes into your mouth.  It may be that you are eating more than you think.  Measure your portions - measuring spoons can be your best friend.  Eat whole foods, protein and nutrient rich, lowfat. 1200 calories of healthy fruits veggies and lean meats are better for you than 1200 calories of doritos.  If you are vigilant about this, the weight loss should be a bit easier.\n\nAs far as exercise goes, vary what you do.  Weight training helps to build muscle which will burn more fat during rest.  Cardio is also important.  Try bumping up the intensity of your cardio.  Try adding 10 minutes on to it.  Some people do well with a half hour of running, personally, I do best with an hour of walking - same calories burned, different time.\n\nGood luck with this.  The best way I have found to do these things is to find things I like.  Giving up junk food is hard, but I find foods that are good for me that I like just as much.  This helps a lot.  Find exercise you enjoy doing - rollerblading, tennis, dancing.  It may take awhile, but you WILL do this!"

State that to your knowledge the business failed and you did not receive a 1099.  As long as you are honest and pay the required tax, that is all you are required to do."

I learned a lot of things and I think being there for 18 years of my life was pretty dang cool.\nMy dad still farms and even though I don't make the 400 mile trip home to the farm as often as I'd like to, it makes it really special to take trips there, especially now that I've got kids. \nFarming is awesome.

Yes you can, you can even do both via the Internet by using a members only site.  Depending on the state your in will depend on how much information you need from the retailers that you sell to.  You will have to keep records of their tax numbers for sure but some states require more.  The retail site you will have to worry about sales tax for orders from your state only.

"If you love going to church, can you give it up for Lent?

Probably not...I'm not Catholic, but from what I understand, the point of Lent is to give up something you love for the sake of connecting with God. I guess it would be similar to turning off the cell phone for a day to spend more time with your family...excuse the cheesy example. But going back to the point; Unless church distracts you from your relationship with God, I'm pretty sure it's off-limits as a Lent sacrifice."

Hi Josh. I'd like to take a stab at your question, because I am always interested in helping either fellow christians or woould be christians that have an open heart get closer to god in a sincere, but non-pushy way. \n\nThat being said, have you ever felt like you were in a no-win situation? Maybe even a life or death experience, where you thought there was no way out? And yet you could feel ro sense things beyond your control either rescuing you from harm's way or voices or forces pulling you to go in one direction or another that ultimately made the difference in your life?\n\nWell those are points of evidence towards God. They could be angles helping to keep you on the right path or simply preventing you from going under. Whatever the case may be, God is all around us. You can't see bacteria or the wind, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, does it?\n\nToo often people who have lost their way or never even knew the way write off things they can't readily see or explain. I feel bad for athiests because they deny or block the love God has for them. They really enjoy being angry. These people are much like the rich: hey are consumed by material things that they can see, and yet even when they seemingly have it all they're still not happy, becuase it's never enough. God won't come to you in a box, or in the form of a house or from a steering wheel. But that doesn't mean he's not there. \n\nPlease don't let the world block out god from your heart and from your life. God is all around you, but he gave you the free will to choose to believe, so have the faith and know that whatever energy you spend on letting him into your life will not go unwasted. It never does and in the end the truth will come out and you will have been better and wiser for knowing it when you meet God someday. \n\nHope this gave you some hope."

"Scientifically, what's the best time of the day for the body to excercise and lose weight and stay fit?

the only serious studies, involving professional or near-professional, athletes, have not come to any conclusion regarding this.\n\nthere also does not seem to be any correlation between the time people usually train, and their performance during a race, if held (or not) at the time they usually train.\n\nto lose or maintain weight, it's simple thermodynamics, it's a matter of how many calories are spent, and how many consumed.  Running, for example, will consume about 70 to 75 calories for an average adult male of normal weight, and that's irrespective of when in the day the person runs.\n\nexercising intensively in the morning, if not had time to properly warm-up, can lead to injuries.  But exercising at night, on tired muscles, can also lead to injuries.  Exercising too close to bed time is said to lead to lower quality of sleep in the early sleep.\n\nexercising early, if it takes so much time that the person has to skip breakfast, could accelerated weight loss - but the effect would be opposite if the person then felt so hungry that they'd have two chocolate bars at 10am.  Same for exercising over lunch.\n\n\nBottom-line: I'd say that all times of the day are pretty much equivalent, and that each person should just pick those times that they feel better about, and /or that best fit their daily schedule."

""Ownership"" of the LLC is reflected in the individual ""member's interest,"" i.e., the member's share of the profit and losses of the company, rights to receive distribution of assets, and to participate in the management of the company.\n\nLLP: A limited-liability partnership (LLP) is similar to a general partnership, except the partners are not personally liable for negligent acts conducted by other partners or employees not under their supervision.\n\nInc: A corporation is a legal entity that can exist separately from its owners. Creation of a corporation occurs when properly completed articles of incorporation (called a charter or certificate of incorporation in some states) are filed with the proper state authority, and all fees are paid."

"Do I probably have uterine cancer with thickening of the uterine wall?

Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer:- An annual Pap test and pelvic examination beginning as soon as young woman becomes sexually active, or between the age 17-20 years, are the most important diagnostic steps for early detection of uterine cancer. The Pap smear can pick up cervical dyplasia and the conventional physican may then perform a colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix to give a better understanding of the abnormalities. If only a small area of the cervix is affected, the recommendation may be made for more frequent Pap tests (about every three to six months) to monitor for changes in the cells of the cervix. Additional diagnostic tests for uterine cancer may include laparoscopy, laparotomy, or vaginosonography. In 2002, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel suggested adding a screening test for HPV in addition to Pap smears since HPV is such a high risk factor for cervical cancer. The screening test could help separate women at high risk for more frequent screening than women not at high risk.\nPlease consult your physician if you have any doubts."
"Muslim American woman and Muslim Pakistani husband.?
I have been married to a man for 5 years. In all of this time, he's managed to isolate me from everyone, and two years ago I stopped putting up with it and fighting back. He used to really physically abuse me, and then I kicked his butt back one time so badly it dislocated a disc in his spine. Since then, he never attacked me like that again. But all of this time, he's never been happy for any successes I've achieved. He always expected me to act like his success was the best thing in the world and the reason I was alive. I am graduating from College in December, and he's refused to even take off for that. His cheating brother controls his every move. I am divorcing him, though he doesn't know this is in the works. This just adds fuel to the fire. I feel so alone and am given absolutely no love or affection from him that I've started spending time with an ex from my past.  He doesn't even care about that.  I know it's over, but part of me still wants to salvage it.  It's unhealthy and

"What is glysnose?

If yo mean glynase, SEE BELOW:\n\nBrand name:\nMicronase\nPronounced: MIKE-roh-naze \nGeneric name: Glyburide \nOther brand names: DiaBeta,\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Glynase \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhy is this drug prescribed?\n\nMicronase is an oral antidiabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, the kind that occurs when the body either does not make enough insulin or fails to use insulin properly. Insulin transfers sugar from the bloodstream to the body's cells, where it is then used for energy. \n\nThere are two forms of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes results from a complete shutdown of normal insulin production and usually requires insulin injections for life, while type 2 diabetes can usually be treated by dietary changes, exercise, and/or oral antidiabetic medications such as Micronase. This medication controls diabetes by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin and by helping insulin to work better. Type 2 diabetics may need insulin injections, sometimes only temporarily during stressful periods such as illness, or on a long-term basis if an oral antidiabetic medication fails to control blood sugar. \n\nMicronase can be used alone or along with a drug called metformin (Glucophage) if diet plus either drug alone fails to control sugar levels. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost important fact about this drug\nReturn to top\n\nAlways remember that Micronase is an aid to, not a substitute for, good diet and exercise. Failure to follow a sound diet and exercise plan can lead to serious complications, such as dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. Remember, too, that Micronase is not an oral form of insulin, and cannot be used in place of insulin. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow should you take this medication?\nReturn to top\n\nIn general, Micronase should be taken with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. \n\n--If you miss a dose...\n\nTake it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the one you missed and go back to your regular schedule. Never take 2 doses at the same time. \n\n--Storage instructions...\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed. Store it at room temperature. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat side effects may occur?\nReturn to top\n\nSide effects cannot be anticipated. If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking Micronase. \n\nMany side effects from Micronase are rare and seldom require discontinuation of the medication. \n\n\nMore common side effects may include: \nBloating, heartburn, nausea\n\nLess common or rare side effects may include: \nAnemia and other blood disorders, blurred vision, changes in taste, headache, hives, itching, joint pain, liver problems, muscle pain, reddening of the skin, skin eruptions, skin rash, yellowing of the skin\nMicronase, like all oral antidiabetics, may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) especially in elderly, weak, and undernourished people, and those with kidney, liver, adrenal, or pituitary gland problems. The risk of hypoglycemia can be increased by missed meals, alcohol, other medications, fever, trauma, infection, surgery, or excessive exercise. To avoid hypoglycemia, you should closely follow the dietary and exercise plan suggested by your physician. \n\n\nSymptoms of mild hypoglycemia may include: \nCold sweat, drowsiness, fast heartbeat, headache, nausea, nervousness\n\nSymptoms of more severe hypoglycemia may include: \nComa, pale skin, seizures, shallow breathing\nEating sugar or a sugar-based product will often correct mild hypoglycemia. \n\nSevere hypoglycem"

"does someone make a 22magnum semi-automatic pistol?

The AMT Automag II described by Pathfinder is the only .22 Magnum semi-auto pistol I've ever heard of. There have been several different revolvers chambered in .22 Mag. They've been available for over thirty years, they work well, and they're still available new today.\nI believe the scarcity of .22 Mag autoloading pistols stems more from technical design problems than ammo cost. With very few exceptions semi-auto pistols are either blowback or recoil operated, and the combined high chamber pressure and low recoil of the .22 Mag. leads to difficulties with both systems. Fluted chambers and similar ""tricks"" have been less than effective at solving the problems, and even though the Automag II made it into production it gained a reputation for poor reliability.\n    There have been several attempts since the 1960s to design a reliable .22 Mag. semi-auto RIFLE and they've also met with indifferent success, although by many accounts Ruger now has it right with their 10-22 Magnum."
"Why do like charges repel each other?

Every system has a tendency to lower it's energy.\n\nFor a system of 2 like/unlike charges (q1,q2), the energy of the system is given by the equation\nU=k(q1)(q2)/r\nwhere U=potential energy\n           k=constant for a medium(medium is one in which charges are kept eg air, water etc.)\n           q1,q2=charges(including their sign, positive or negetive)\n           r=dist. between charges\nFor U to be minimum, r should be maximum, everything else kept constant.\ntherefore, like charges move away to increase r.\n\nIncase of unlike charges one will be negetive and other positive. Let q1 be negetive, so U=k(-q1)(q2)/r\nNow, for U to be minimum, r should be minimum so charges attract.\nHence like charges repel and unlike attract."

"How long after?
A friend was flatline for about 20 seconds and had to be shocked back that was almost 3 days ago and yet she still has a pain in her chest, the doctors say it's normal and it will go in a day or two, also she had her stomache pumped and keeps having nose bleeds is that anything to do with it? Her doctors are all saying it's normal but they don't sound too reassuring
If your friend had to be resucitated then I'm not surprised her chest hurts.  The shock that jolts a heart back into rhythm affects all the muscles of the chest, not to mention any CPR that was likely done would also have left her sore.  Restarting a heart isn't like changing a battery in the back of your watch after all.  The nose bleeds are probably due to irritation from the tubing placed to evacuate her stomach, and the mucous membranes will heal in a few days as well.   All things considered, if her worst physical problems are a sore chest and nose bleeds, then she is considerably blessed- considering the other option was death.  She is fortunate that whatever had to be removed from her stomach didn't do any damage.  It's not the usual procedure to remove things that aren't hazardous, so I'm guessing she took an overdose of something.  I hope if that's the case she is recieving some sort of mental health counseling as well.   Physically speaking, the things you are listing are normal after what she had done, and the time frame the doctors are giving you is about right.  But if she is nervous about it, she can always ask another doctor for a second opinion."

anything is possible in organic chemistry. but it is a very difficult task to convert a sugar to ephedrine since there a lot of structural dissimilarities between these two. an excellent organic chemist may be able to do it, but may end up with some unexpected result, like less yield, dangerous reactions etc. since better to avoid it, there are a lot of other procedure for the synthesis of ephedrine and even you can isolate ephedrine from its source plant called Ephedra gerardiana, E.nebrodensis, E.sinica etc."

In general, it will probably be a few weeks if the tax records are straight forward and you don't fall into an area of concern for the IRS (e.g. AMT, high deductions, etc).  Filing earlier than the April 15th deadline may help, simply because of avoiding the mass return processing the IRS has to do after that date."
"my husband is vomiting and have been felling very weak anf feels like he wants to faint?

Schedule an apointment with a doctor. So far, it sounds like the flu. However, if he does actually pass out, or he gets any more symptoms that make him seem worse, you should go to the ER as soon as you can. This could be a sign of something more serious than just the flu. Until then, get plenty of rest and lots of fluids. Try giving him some pieces of banana also if he has been throwing up. He might need potassium."
"how many types of surgery are there for the treatment of colorectal cancer?
what are the types of surgery avaiable?
There are many different types of surgery and different names for the operations. However the two main procedures are:\npartial removal of the large bowel with rejoining of the two ends of bowel so that bowel function is normal\n\npartial removal of the large bowel without rejoining of the two ends of bowel. This leaves a stoma (opening) on the abdominal wall that is fitted with a bag to collect waste and the lower end of the bowel is just sewn over leaving a stump at the rectum. This sort of operation is sometimes done initially and then the two ends are rejoined at a later date.\n\nHope this helps!"
"is there a relation between masturbation and hypertension?
i used to masturbate 6 years ago, and i'm suffering from hypertension . i'm 22 years old.
If anything, it would reduce it.\n\nOrgasms (no matter how achieved) release natural endorphins.  While pulse and plood pressure go up during a sexual act, they quickly fall off to a lower then normal rate afterwards.

Genetics, diet, or stress in your life is a much more likely reason."

In aircraft structural repair, reverse engineering is used all the time.\n\nSince repair centers do not have access to aircraft design stress reports, engineers must 'reverse engineer' the existing structure to determine the maximum stress loads that the original design is capable of withstanding... and/or determine the load carrying capability lost due to the damage.\n\nOnce these loads are obtained (from reverse engineering), then a repair can be designed to restore loads lost from damage."

"what should i avoid if i have type one dibetes?

Nothing in particular, except smoking. Smoking causes characteristic damage to several body systems, and it reinforces the damage diabetes does. No one needs both at work. Give it up! If you have lost feeling in the feet, it's best by far to check them often for signs of blisters or cuts or skin breaks of any kind. The reason is that, if you can't feel it, you won't take care of it. Diabetes is the largest cause of amputation in adults in theh North America save trauma (like automobile accidents). The reason is largely reduced circulation, and reduced wound healing, and increased infection severity in many diabetics. Watch those feet.   \n\n\nNo food, or food type, is inherently bad for diabetics, and in the case of Type 1 diabetics, there is less concern for various kinds of food than for Type 2 diabetics, for whom excess weight seems to both bring on Type 2, but also to make more severe cases. \n\nThe problem for Type 1s is that, producing no insulin of their own, it's necessary to provide insulin from the outside, and to come as close as possible to the non-diabetic levels of insulin so that blood glucose levels are as near normal as possible. Insulin controls how, and how much, about 2.3 of body cells taek up glucose from the blood. Among much else, of course, for it is a hormone which has wide and varied effects throughout the body. \n\nThere are several things which affect how fast and high blood glucose goes: \n\n--First is how much food is eaten. In this case, sugar (sucrose), milk sugar (lactose), starch (many glucoses stuck together in chains), fat (a small part of fats -- the glycerol backbone -- can be converted to glucose in the body), and so on. All provide glucose, eventually, to the blood. One of the purpsoes of the 'exchange' system is to provide a handy way to estimate the food quantities eaten. \n\n--Second is exercise. Even without insulin, exercise (even mild exercise such as a brisk walk) causes glucose to be uptaken by muscle cells. Given any partiuclar amount of food, exercising before the meal will result in less inculin needed than otherwise, since the mechanisms are independent. teh effect lasts for some hours, so a brisk walk for 30 minutes just after luch will still increase glucose absorprion rates of food eaten at dinner.  \n\n--Third, is the amount of insulin. All other things being equal, more insulin means that more glucose will be absorbed from the blood by body cells and less insulin will mean less. \n\n--Fourth, type of insulin. There are several types of insulin. They vary largely by how long their effect (forcing absroption of glucose from the blood) lasts, and whether there is a marked peak in action. So, a given amount of regular insulin acts faster and more intensely than lente ('slow') insulin which takes longer to exhaust itself, or ultra lente ('very slow') insulin. NPH insulin falls between regular and lente in speed of action adn suration of action. The analog insulins (one from Lilly and one from Novo Nordisk) are much more quickly acting, beginning totake effect with 15 or 20 minutes and being done in an hour or perhaps an hour and a half. Two special insulins, Lantus and Detemir, are unusual in that they exhibit very little peak of action. Their insulin effect  takes place steadily over about 24 hours. \n\nLocation of administration also has a secondary effect on how long the insulin effect lasts. \n\n--Fifth is the composition of the food eaten.  For example, skim milk contains lactose (a mildly sweetish dual sugar) which is disassembled into its component simple sugars and absorbed by the intestines. Drinking the same amount of whole milk delivers the same amount of lactose, but much more slowly since the butterfat in the whole milk slows down digestive action on the lactose. A baked potato eaten 'dry' will be converted to glucose and absorbed, while the smae amount of potato eaten with butter or sour cream is much more slowly a"

"are perfectionists more prone to feelinf inadequate than those who aren't perfectionists?

Yes, I am a perfectionist and although I have two children and a husband and a lot of people say that they envy me, I do still feel inadequate at times.

It really is not a good way to be, but the problem is it is very hard to change.  I have been this way my whole life."
"My son is an out of control teen. Should I plant drug on him and call the cops?
HE is constantly giving my wife and I some serious back talking. He is supposed to be home at 10 pm and he always shows up at 10:15. he almost never cleans his room, he is always on the phone talking to some girl he won't let us meet her. Long story short he has really crossed the line when he came home and didn't fill the car up. So i am wondering what are the best drugs to really get im locked up.
i feel for ya! my daughter was giving me the attitude about having to work 65 hours per week at mc donalds! think this over carefully....if you have the rebel busted, you both lose....do what i did AND PUT THE KID TO WORK!!!! since he's so interested in girls, be sure to get him a job at the nursing home giving sponge baths to the old biddies. and do like i did...MAKE THE KID WALK! trust me, after putting in a 12 hour day giving sponge baths and emptying bed pans, the kid will never look at another girl again!"

"Is it just me, or does implying that people of darker complexion as colored...?
...also imply that everyone else that is not 'colored' as the pure, and fundamental complexion?\nWith everything else just siting on top of it? \nWhat are your thoughts?
That is what it implies to me.\nI never refer to people by their complexion unless I'm at a loss, and then I use light complected, medium complected or dark complected. Never colored or black or even African American. They are American. I am American. I am not pale or Irish/German American and would hate to be categorized like that.

"Its 4am EST, Can't Sleep NEED HELP. Any suggestions? Must wake up in 3 hours.?

i have always been quite the insomniac. luckily for me, I'm on a night shift now, and seeing as i enjoy staying up late i just do and it's fine. however i wasn't always on a night shift so i can give u some of my techniques.\n\n1.) first of all, u could try herbal supplements. Valerian root and melatonin are the two best. melatonin will always be in pill form that i know of, but it's just a replicate of the exact same chemical that your brain uses to put you to sleep. it's either the best stuff out there or it won't work at all. that depends on you. Valerian root on the other hand, has one major benefit for you. it doesn't to be a pill. u can actually buy this in it's natural form and i think u boil it in some water. the pills for valerian root and melatonin are the most convenient.  there may also be some herbal teas that have it.\n\n2.)ur second bet is herbal teas. there are alot of them available a sleep aid and even if they don't have Valerian root they do have other things that work. and drinking something warm before u go to bed usually helps you go to sleep anyhow. warm milk can sometimes do it for me. you need to make sure, however, that you do not drink anything with sugar or caffeine in it at least 2 hours before you go to bed. if i have to go to bed at ten, i don't drink caffeine after 5 pm, or not at all if i can help it. also, u might try not smoking about a half hour before sleeping if u r a smoker.\n\n3.) another thing u can try is a sleep CD. my friend Whitney swears by some of them. they have music or sounds or just gentle whispering and she says that some of hers will put u to sleep within 5 minutes of starting them.\n\n4.) make sure that you have the most comfortable bed set up possible. if your like me, your body and mind love finding any excuse to get up, and the wrong pillow blanket and mattress is an easy target. i love the foam pillows but the foam mattresses suck for me. but it all depends on you. if you sleep in clothes, make sure they are soft and loose. it's better to sleep in the nude, however. also keeping a room a bit too cold for ur tastes but having plenty of cover is a great way to go to sleep. you'll wrap urself up tightly and u won;t move. soon you'll be asleep. i always sleep better in winter.\n\n5.) reading or watching a television show that just DOES NOT INTEREST YOU is another way. i watch the news because i hate the news. sometimes the news can conk me out in the middle of the day. \n\n6.)there are plenty of meditation exercises out there and lots of them can relax you to the point of sleepiness. instructions for quite a few should be available on line, but try this one: breath in and fill your lungs all the way up. imagine that when you breathe in you are breathing in a number (the number one for the first breath and so on). fill ur lungs up completely with ones. then breath out all of the ones (emptying ur lungs completely) and then continue with the number two. sounds crazy but it does relax you and if ur laying on ur back in ur bed, it can actually put you to sleep.\n\ni hope one of these works!!"
"i want to work from home, is there any job business analyst?
i worked on two projects. I used to take the requirements from the clients, then preparing the project documents analysing the screens and explaining them to the programmers. I use to support them by explaining the project requirements.previously i worked as a business analyst in software company.
To be honest, you are probably not going to find a job working from home. Any opportunities you find that requires a start up fee or money up front is a scam, don't get sucked in!!\n\nI encourage you to immediately put these jobs out of your mind.  Here are some of my tips when looking for a job....\n\nNetworking - Register at your local Unemployment Office (you don't need to be on unemployment to register for their assistance). They often will have networking groups on a regular basis. They also are a good source for the jobs that never show up in the paper or online.\n\nCheck your local paper -- In many cases the paper's classified are now online.\n\nSearch Smart Online -- If you don't have a lot of time, spend most of your time at sites that aggregate the job feeds from several job search engines. Prominently these include indeed.com and thingamajob.com.\n\nOrganization -- I use a free online application that allows you to track your ads, jobs you apply for, send or print mail merged correspondence, and track your job search history. This site is jobsearchlog.com\nI invite you to check it out and you'll be able to keep track of what you apply for.\n\nGood Luck,\n\nKaren\nSource(s):\n\nhttp://indeed.com\nhttp://job-hunt.org\nhttp://jobsearchlog.com"
"Another Fart question?
Ok so, I fart, and it dissipates into the air … does the fart ever transform into something else once it mingles with the air?  How come the smell does not stay perpetually?
the fart doesn't actually transform into something else, except perhaps a wrinkled nose or a full blown facial expression if you'll pardon me.\nfarts are mainly methane, hydrogen sulphide, and others.\nthey normally become part of the atmosphere and may dissolve in water, mostly into moisture that will eventually fall as rain. then the dissolved gases enter the soil with the rain and are taken up by the roots of plants."

YOU ASK WHY I FOLLOW THIS JESUS? \n\nYou ask why I follow this Jesus? \nWhy I love Him the way I do? \nWhen the world's turned away from His teachings \nAnd the people who serve Him are few. \n\nIt's not the rewards I'm after \nOr gifts that I hope to receive \nIt's the Presence that calls for commitment \nIt's the Spirit I trust and believe. \n\nThe Lord doesn't shelter His faithful \nOr spare them all suffering and pain, \nLike everyone else I have burdens, \nAnd walk through my share of rain. \n\nYet He gives me a plan and a purpose, \nAnd that joy only Christians have known, \nI never know what comes tomorrow, \nBut I do know I'm never alone. \n\nIt's the love always there when you need it; \nIt's the words that redeem and inspire, \nIt's the longing to ever be with Him \nThat burns in my heart like a fire. \n\nSo you ask why I love my Lord Jesus? \nWell, friend, that's so easy to see, \nBut the one thing that fills me with wonder is \nWhy Jesus loves someone like me. \n~Author Anonymous

Probably not the act of photocopying. You can see pictures of money on all kinds of sites, even the government.

"Pain in lower leg/calf/shin?
I am getting severe pains in my lower leg, around the calfs and shin/ankle when I exercise and even now when walking. I exercise a lot, but do not do any running due to suffering shin splints last year. I have always exercised a lot - so cannot see how it could be over-working Can you suggest a supplement to help? Or a type of specialist I should see.
sounds to me like exercise induced compartment syndrome.  the thick tissue surrounding your muscles (fascia) is too tight. as you exercise or walk the muscles engorge with blood but are then squashed by the tight fascia. Leads to a cramp like pains in your calves. due to the history it is unlikely to be a blood clot or anything.  you need to go and see a sports specialist dr. they can do a test where they put needles into the compartments to measure the pressure in there as you walk on a treadmill.  they can then do a small operation to split the fascia to relieve some of the pressure"

Familes can be together forever, through Heavenly Father's plan.  Even Born Again Christians often claim to believe this (even though it runs counter to their official beliefs.)"

"Scenario on Chlorine Gas?

Background: Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Chlorine gas was  first used as a chemical weapon at Ypres, France in 1915. Of the 70,552 American soldiers poisoned with various gasses in World War I, 1843 were exposed to chlorine gas.\n    Pathophysiology: Chlorine is a greenish-yellow, noncombustible gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The intermediate water solubility of chlorine accounts for its effect on the upper airway and the lower respiratory tract. Exposure to chlorine gas may be prolonged because its moderate water solubility may not cause upper airway symptoms for several minutes. In addition, the density of the gas is greater than that of air, causing it to remain near ground level and increasing exposure time. The odor threshold for chlorine is approximately 0.3-0.5 parts per million (ppm); however, distinguishing toxic air levels from permissible air levels may be difficult until irritative symptoms are present.\n     Chlorine is moderately soluble in water and reacts in combination to form hypochlorous (HOCl) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids. Elemental chlorine and its derivatives, hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids, may cause biological injury. The chemical reactions of chlorine combining with water and the subsequent derivative reactions with HOCl and HCl are as follows:\n\na1) Cl2 + H2O « HCl (hydrochloric acid) + HOCL (hypochlorous acid) or\n\na2) Cl2 + H2O « 2 HCl + [O-] (nascent oxygen)\n\nb) HOCl « HCl + [O-]\n\n   Mechanism of activity\nThe mechanisms of the above biological activity are poorly understood and the predominant anatomic site of injury may vary, depending on the chemical species produced. Cellular injury is believed to result from the oxidation of functional groups in cell components, from reactions with tissue water to form hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid, and from the generation of free oxygen radicals. Although the idea that chlorine causes direct tissue damage by generating free oxygen radicals was once accepted, this idea is now controversial.\n     Solubility effects\nHydrochloric acid is highly soluble in water. The predominant targets of the acid are the epithelia of the ocular conjunctivae and upper respiratory mucus membranes.\n     Hypochlorous acid is also highly water soluble with an injury pattern similar to hydrochloric acid. Hypochlorous acid may account for the toxicity of elemental chlorine and hydrochloric acid to the human body.\n\n      Early response to chlorine gas\nChlorine gas, when mixed with ammonia, reacts to form chloramine gas. In the presence of water, chloramines decompose to ammonia and hypochlorous acid or hydrochloric acid. The early response to chlorine exposure depends on the (1) concentration of chlorine gas, (2) duration of exposure, (3) water content of the tissues exposed, and (4) individual susceptibility.\n\n      Immediate effects\nThe immediate effects of chlorine gas toxicity include acute inflammation of the conjunctivae, nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Irritation of the airway mucosa leads to local edema secondary to active arterial and capillary hyperemia. Plasma exudation results in filling the alveoli with edema fluid, resulting in pulmonary congestion.\n\n     Pathologic findings\nPathologic findings are nonspecific. They include severe pulmonary edema, pneumonia, hyaline membrane formation, multiple pulmonary thromboses, and ulcerative tracheobronchitis.\n\n      The hallmark of pulmonary injury associated with chlorine toxicity is pulmonary edema, manifested as hypoxia. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is thought to occur when there is a loss of pulmonary capillary integrity, and subsequent transudation of fluid into the alveolus is present. The onset can occur within minutes or hours, depending upon severity of exposure. Persistent hypoxemia is associated with a higher mortality rate.\n     The eye seldom is"

This factor makes keeping marines more difficult than freshwater species as the fish involved have little tolerance to changing conditions - they never encounter any - but, advantageously it means that all marine fish will be at home in one common type of water. \n\nExcept for those few aquarists who have access to natural tropical seawater, the majority of marine fishkeepers have to rely on preparing their own synthetic variety using commercially-available salt mixes.\n\n \nTo make sure the water is mixed to the correct conditions, test the 'strength' of the mix by measuring the Specific Gravity (S.G) of a sample. \nIn Nature, this approximates to 35 ppt (parts per thousand) or, in practical terms 35 grams of salt per litre of water, approximately S.G of 1.025; in this example, the S.G of the sample reads 1.024 which is satisfactory for a reef tank but could be lower (1.021-1.023) for a 'fish only' collection.\nIt is important to measure the S.G. when the water is at the correct temperature (75oF) and thankfully most hydrometers offered at the aquatic outlets are calibrated at this value. \n\n\n\n\nSynthetic seawater should be mixed in clean plastic containers and aerated for at least 24 hours before use.\n\nOne of the curses of the marine aquarium (not helped either by the intense lighting found on most systems) is unwanted algae; this is further encouraged by phosphates and nitrates found in the water used to make the seawater. \nAlways use a salt-mix that is labelled 'phosphate and nitrate free' and also make sure that water used is also free of these substances too.\n\nSource water can range from absolutely free of anything tapwater (via Reverse Osmosis treatment), nitrate removed by a Nitragon unit or phosphate removed by using RowaPhos(tm) in a filter.\nAdditionally, clean rainwater can be used.\n\nNitrate levels can be kept to a minimum im the aquarium by the action of use anaerobic de-nitrifying bacterial colonies within Living Rock, and by regular partial water changes. The build up of nitrate can also be minimised by using a protein skimmer to remove organic substances from the water before the nitrite-forming and nitrate-converting bacteria can get their hands on them. \n\nKeep a check on pH and nitrate levels: rising nitrate levels and a falling pH means it's time for a water change. Whilst nitrate levels in a fish-only collection can be allowed to rise, invertebrates appreciate really low levels (zero, preferably"
"why do you think the details of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle contraction....?
why do you think the details of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle contraction are fairly well understood, but knowledge of contaction of smooth muscle is more limited?
Cardiac and skeletal muscles are both highly organized and contract in a single direction, uniformly. Smooth muscle, on the other hand is much more loosely organized. This probably leads to confusion about the order of contraction, etc."

"after the bottle of sofdrink has been opened for sometimes, the biting taste is lost. expalain and why?

Remember:\n\nH2CO3 <----> H20 + CO2 is an equilibrium\n\nThe bottle is pressurized with carbon dioxide, so the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of carbonic acid. When the bottle is opened, the pressure of CO2 drops and the CO2 equilibrates with the atmosphere. That shifts the equilibrium to the right, and the drink slowly loses its carbonation. When you close the top, enough CO2 is created to recreate the setting of the equilibrium and most of the H2CO3 remains.\n\nThe biting taste is from the carbonic acid."
"What are your thoughts on this?
In high school a guy wrote, ""If God is good and God is great, why did he make a big mistake and create a world devoid of love and full of hate.""\n\nI always thought it was interesting and a little sad.  What about you?
Since God has no body and is a spirit. He and the Goddess created us so that they can learn to experience life through us. I don't believe that this world is void of love. There are lots of loving people around you just have to find them. Those who are not loving are actually fearful souls who have been hurt and to save face from others and showing their hurt, they choose to walk the dark path. However, they cannot truly be lost for all paths lead to the path of enlightenment. Some just take the scenic route while others take the expressway."
"Genetics Protein?
In eukaryotes, it is not uncommon for a single effector protein to regualte the synthesis of several different proteins encoded by distinct RNAs. Explain in molecular terms how this could happen?
That effector molecule you are referring to often will be a transcription factor.  One very famous example is NF-kB.  Every gene has elements in their promoter region that regulate the transcription of that gene.  These transcription factors will be able to bind their specific elements in the promoter and initate transcription of that gene.  So several genes can have promoter elements for NF-kB, therefore, when NF-kB is made, it will initiation transcription of several genes, leading to translation of the genes, and then proteins."
"How do you get a job as a mediator?

This is a tough one, since there's no information about your background, your education, professional experience, or training as a mediator.   Let me give this the best shot I can.\n\nFirst of all, there are very few jobs for mediators, and it can be difficult, although not impossible, to build a successful career as a mediator.  Many mediators are in private practice and have established their own businesses.  Organizations that do hire mediators tend to bring in people who possess a particular professional background which makes these mediators suitable for the types of disputes the organization works to resolve.  They also tend to hire people who already have substantial mediation experience, not those who are just beginning in the field.  I don’t mean to sound discouraging, but that’s the reality.\n\nTo get a job as a mediator or to start your own business, you have to have training first, since this is, after all, a profession with codes of ethics and conduct.  You should contact a mediator in the state you reside in to find out what the minimum requirements may be there for training, or get in touch with a professional association for alternative dispute resolution professionals.  They can help you.  Visit Mediate.com, an online resource for information about mediation, as well as the web site for the Association for Conflict Resolution at www.acrnet.org, which has chapters for mediators throughout the U.S.  \n\nBy the way, do your homework before enrolling in any training program to make sure that you’re receiving training from a reputable organization, and be suspicious of organizations which claim to provide training on the internet or through distance learning programs.  Also, watch out for training programs that claim to offer ""certification"" -- only a few state courts certify mediators, so this can be a confusing claim.\n\nFor a great resource on mediation training, visit this Ohio web site at http://www.disputeresolution.ohio.gov/brochures/cgtrainer.htm  \n\nTraining may also include study at an institute of higher learning, such as a master's degree program in conflict resolution at an accredited university.  Many universities offer such programs.  This can be a good way to begin, since many of these institutions have career placement offices which can assist you in exploring career opportunities.\n\nYou also need to take a look at your own background. What could you offer clients? What is your professional experience?  Is it in social work? Human resources? The law? Education?  Public policy? The environment?  Digital technology?  The arts?  (Just to name a few.)  Many mediators who find career success do so because they have used their existing jobs or positions as a launch pad to building a mediation practice, adding mediation as a service they can offer existing clients or customers.  \n\nI would also recommend getting yourself a copy of Forrest Mosten’s Mediation Career Guide for some useful ideas on careers in mediation.  In addition, get in touch with practicing mediators and ask them for their ideas. \n\nBest of luck to you!"

"I am gay, should I tell my straight friend I like him or leave him alone?
I have a good college friend who is straight and knows I am gay. He is nice and accepting and invites me to hang out with his friends or to study with him often. I am torn becaue I think I have a crush on him, so I end up rejecting his invitations fearing that my feelings towards him will only grow stronger. I am thinking of telling him, but think it would probably be a bad idea. What would really come of it? However I feel so torn that I sometimes feel it would be best just not to be a part of his life. I think it would be rude just to leave him and never give him any reasons. Does anyone have any advice for me in this situation? I would really appreciate it.
Crushes fade, perhaps you dont have a lover. Perhaps you are overwhelmed by your feelings for this guy, because he is being friendly. Maybe you are  lonely, i don't know. What i think is that if you tell him, he will tell his other mates and you may get hurt. Take care of yourself, whatever you decide. If you have to go to this college, and the fact that you are hesitant about telling him, may leave you very vulnerable if he is not accepting of the way you feel right now."

my wife is pregnant she has developed urine/kidney infection, bcause she drinks water very less.\nprblm here is that gyna has recommend my wife to not do the Kegels. Is there any harm associated with Kegels for a Pregnant women
Maybe your wife's OB/GYN has a good reason for recommending she stop Kegels.  You might ask the doctor for an explanation.  But this is what I found on that subject:\n\nKegels\nKegels are one of the best exercises that you can do while pregnant, and they don’t even seem like exercise! You just need to squeeze your pelvic floor muscles for a few minutes every day. Kegel exercises help to strengthen your pelvic floor, which often stretches during pregnancy. This will keep your bladder from dropping, which can cause incontinence. \n\n\nAND:\n\nOne type of exercise that can help your muscles prepare for delivery, help support your uterus during pregnancy, and help you to control your urine are pelvic floor exercises (also called Kegel exercises). Pelvic muscles are the same ones you use to stop and start your flow of urine. You can do this exercise standing, sitting, or lying down."

well for the life isn't fair comment tell him he is lucky to learn that at a young age. As for his attitude. Thats a tuff one I have kids his age and I firmly believe in restricting the peers he/she hangs out with. Also if it is possible get him involved in activities after school. Baseball or whatever he is in to. If he is not interested, make him do it for one season or one whatever depending on what you choose. I did this and my daughter cried and stomped her feet. Now she plays softball every chance she gets, and I can tell her if she is not good she wont play. It's hard to give advice without knowing your exact situation but I hope this helps.

"How do we decrease typhoid fever?

Globally, public health agencies have implemented policies to help prevent and control typhoid.  These include improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and good medical care.  In some communities those goals are too lofty and some believe that vaccination for high risk populations is the best way.  There are currently two vaccines in common use.\n\nTo better understand prevention, you need to study the disease itself.  Typhoid is caused by a virulent and invasive bacterium called Salmonella typhi.  This bacteria spreads through contaminated food or water and occasionally through direct contact with someone that is already infected.  In developing countries, the cause is generally poor santitation and contaminated drinking water.  Industrialized countries usually see typhoid when a traveler brings it back from a trip and then spreads it to others via the fecal-oral route.\n\nTo personally protect yourself from typhoid you can avoid traveling to areas that are endemic to the disease.  If you do travel, consider taking the vaccine.  While the vaccine is useful, it isn't 100% so it is advised that you wash your hands frequently, avoid untreated water (drink bottled or canned water, carbonated water is best, wipe all bottles and cans before using, no ice, bottled water when brushing teeth, etc.), avoid raw fruits and vegetables, choose cooked foods."
"Why do Creationists think when Science proves itself wrong that it's a bad thing?
The only way science progresses is to challenge itself, admit when it was wrong, question its beliefs and proceed in a fresh direction.\n\nThat's a hell of a lot more than I can say about any religion.\n\nDo you not question the Bible out of fear of what you'll find?
ima try to keep it simple.. more of a opinion than answer because of the topic which we won't really know.  \n\nIf you study science hard as hell, you will see how a single cell organism lived in the water, long ago.  When they adapted... to survive for food they grew to 'cilia' (hair) on sides to move thu water after only having on hair(flagella).  To get to the point... cells evolved into tadpoles. then to fish and snakes. then to amphibians like frogs or platypus which is land and water.  Then reptiles and mammals that live on land.  Most say the monkey group grew to human when more complex learning/thinking came...but this could be the beginning of man.  Then religion to explain it all.  THe big bang theory states dinosaurs could of died when a meteor hit earth and clogged the atmosphere with dust so bad that no light was here for years.  No grass, no oxygen.  If the bible says... let there be light... could that of been when it cleared up.  The whole point is there is no way to prove anything that will satisfy us wholely.  If i do not have the cross of jesus... they do not believe... if you tell them anything out of the norm... they doubt it. It will all be confusion until enough knowledge satisfies their interest whether they choose science or religion.  THis is all because we are becoming in need of security thru reality and facts relating to our own patterns.  Most people believe the bible for only its relating content to everyday life rather than the miracles, holy spirit, and other great feats not known or seen to man today.  A scientist will help fulfill these questions as well as an interpretor of faith.  It depends if your a theorist. So its a bad thing for a scientist to fail in his field. The unexplained is sorta why we even have religion.  You must stop collecting facts and give faith to the supreme being....because even the single cell organism came from somewhere and the power to adapt/evolve is unexplained. unexplained gives a sense of unsecurity where we ""fear what we cant control"" (heights, ghost, and other scary sh/it.  we feel we cant control our lives without that being explained, so we fear and act off of that.

Islam hasn't lost as much as we'd like to think. However, like Christianity, it has many who speak with venom and therefore dilute whatever truth may exist in Islam.

"Does the moon get bigger or smaller it sure looks like it sometimes?
Sometimes when you look at the moon is looks huge and at other times it looks smaller.  Is it because its orbit is elliptical?
No its because the atmosphere acts like a lense. When the moon is high in the sky, the atmosphere has little affect on what the moon looks like so it will be smaller, but as it gets closer and closer to the horizon, you will be looking through a lot more atmosphere, which is like a lense of a magnifying glass. Thats why when it is low in the sky, the moon is very huge looking.\n\nBy the way, just for future reference, all orbits are eliptical because a perfectly circular orbit is only theoretical, and would never occur in nature. However the moon's orbit is close enough to circular to not affect how big it looks compared to the affect the atmosphere does."

Exercise becomes important, having a good understanding of anatomy can improve workout routines and reduce the chance of injury.  When you visit the doctor for whatever reason it is beneficial to understand exactly what he/she is explaining or recommending.  If an incident occurs to yourself or someone around you, you'll feel more confident in handling the situation may it be minor or major.(I'm not saying to play doctor!)  If you have kids, or are planning on it, then some A&P(anatomy and physiology) background will go a long way for caring and raising a child, which is probably the most important reason to learn anything.  So one can pass on knowledge."
"Why do we continue to do nothing about animals being slaughtered for fur?
Seals, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits, etc.  are all killed for no reason but that humans want their fur for a status symbol.  We, as a group of civilized (we don't need fur to keep us warm as Native Americans did) should be doing something to say ""Enough already"" to any establishment that sells fur.  \nSTOP THE MADNESS.

"can i take Epitril tablet during  lactation?what is the action of this medicine?can i use it for depression?
i would like to know about depression?what is depression?how it will cure?
Epitril is the trade name in India for Clonazepam. It is an anti-convulsant sedative benzodiazapine. Mothers receiving clonazepam should not breast feed their infants.\nThis is normally used to treat seizures and epilepsy.\n\nIf there is ever any question as to why you are taking a prescribed medication, please contact the prescribing physician."
"What should i major in college?

Enter as undeclared if you're not sure.  Most colleges are designed so that you can take classes for up to one year and still graduate within 4, so you can take classes in a variety of areas to see what you like.  Don't just take something to 'get through', otherwise you'll find your career options are limited to a field you aren't even interested in.  I'm personally a marketing & econometrics double major, so of course I'm biased, but it depends on the person."
"Does anyone else feel uncomfortable when churches that are all black talk about what happened back in ........
slavery or in the 60's? I thought we were supposed to be different from the world? Especially if white people or other races are visiting the church, doesn't that just stirr it up again? I know we need to learn from the past, but why can't we celebrate the good things about people and stop making other races feel uncomfortable, because CHRISTIANS didn't God make the others too? So why can't we have a cultural month instead of just a black history month? Christians only please!
Not uncomfortable as much as saddened. It reminds me of the unjust servant who demanded of his slave to repay his debt of $5 after he was forgiven $50,000 that he owed. They will never go unless they can forget the past and look to Jesus--where they are suppose to be walking toward. You cannot serve two masters, you will either love one and hate the other or be devoted to one and hat the other. If they love civil rights more than growing in the Lord, they will lose their true freedom."

"Why sky appear blue during day and black during night time?

The sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by dust particles in the air.\n\nSunlight is comprised of light in different wavelengths and can easily be split with a prism.  The dust particles in the air are of the right size that they scatter blue light preferentially.  As a result, we see the sky blue.\n\nThe sky is black at night simply because there isn't any blue light to be scattered.\n\nIncidentally, moonlight is yellow because that is the generally reflected colour off the moon's surface.  It is reflected light strongly in the yellow waveband. The yellow light is not affected by atmospheric scattering."

"what is a climax community and primary succession?
what is a climax community and primary sucession?
The term climax community, also described as a climatic climax community is an obsolete ecological term for a biological community of plants and animals which, through the process of succession, has reached an equilibrium or steady state. \n\nPrimary succession is the first stage of the ecological succession of plant life from abiotic land with no soil to fully support plant ecosystems (e.g., a forest). In primary succession, pioneer plants like mosses and lichen, start to ""normalise"" the habitat, creating conditions nearer the optimum for plant growth."
"Pain in upper right thigh.?
What would the cause be for shooting, burning pain in the outer part of the upper right thigh? The pain is about a 4 on a scale of 1-10. The pain comes and goes at will, no matter the position I'm in or the actvity I'm doing. I could be laying on the couch watching t.v or hard at work at the local foundry.  That part of my thigh is consisently partially numb. The pain comes and goes. I had a Dr's appt today. Checked in 30 min. early and realized I didn't have my co pay. told the receptionist that I'd go to bank (bank is down the street from Dr's office)get the  money for the co pay and be back with in 15 min. She told me I'd have to rechedule, I couldn't believe I had to reschedule even tough I was 30 min early and would be back 15 min before scheduled appointment. I agreed to reschudle, the receptionist said I'm sorry but I don't handle the scheduling of appointments. I got irritated and left. Any suggestions on where this pain is from or why I'm having this pain?

it started hurting yesterday and i feel like i have a black eye but i dont but it really does feel bruised but i havent hit my eye && it hurts when i blink & im not sure why ...does anyone know what it could be ??
when I was working with pottery a lot my tear ducts would often get infected or clogged.\nWhen mild it hurt when I blinked, felt bruised, tender around the lower eyelid where the tear duct is. When it was real bad it was red and sometimes swollen around the tear duct area.\n\ngenerally eye drops worked, but, it wasn't an immediate fix; took a few days to heal.\n\nIf this sounds the same:\nI would recomend washing your eye out with cool water.\nDo not rub!\nAnd, if after a day or two, it doesn't get better, go to the doc.\n\nRemember: this is your eye! Don't play around! If you are at all concern that it is something more than an infected tear duct, have it checked out.\nThe absolutely best thing you will ever hear from a doctor is ""You wasting my time for this?""\n\nThe Chronicler"

"when is the best time taking MCAT?
I'm taking all pre-med and lower division class at community college , and then transfer to university. I'm gonna finish all pre-med course by next spring 2008. My question is, should I take MCAT right after I finish Pre-med course? or is it better to take after I transfer to University?\nHow long will MCAT score valid? \nwould medical school admission take any consideration if I take MCAT 2 years prior to apply?\nthank you\np.s: pls answer seriously =)
I find that the right time to take the MCAT is the April of your junior year (in the US, that's the 3rd year of 4) of university.  For example, if you intend to enter medical school in the fall of 2009, you would take the MCAT in April 2008.\n\nYour MCAT score is valid for 3 years after the date you take it.  For example, I took my MCAT in April 2003 (intending to matriculate in medical school in the fall of 2004). That score was valid until April 2006, and the last chance I had to apply for medical school was for matriculation in the fall of 2006 (submitting my application, of course, in late 2005).\n\nAlso, prior to taking the MCAT, make sure you are prepared with the proper knowledge.  Basic chemistry (that learned in a mathematically-based, science concentration-oriented university course), algebra-based physics, organismal biology, molecular/cell biology, and organic chemistry are covered on the exam.  Also, there is the verbal section, which consists of questions regarding the interpretation of nonfiction literature excerpts.\n\nLastly, there is a writing section, where two essays must be written based on two respective prompts.\n\nNote that effective January, 2007, the MCAT will be delivered using a computer-based system.  More information is available in the link below.\n\nHope the advice helps."
"what is the applications of ftir in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries?

FT-IR stands for Fourier Transform - InfraRed\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, FT-IR systems are used to analyze raw materials or finished producy where identification and purity results are critical and where accurate analysis of intermediates and final products is essential and compliance with FDA and GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) guidelines must be clearly documented.\n\nBasically, it's the PRO version of the simple flame test that we used to do in high school chemistry class where you burned different chemicals and determined what they were from their color.

"Which way is West?
Giggle.
West is the direction towards which the sun sets at the equinox, and therefore the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation.\n\nBy convention, the left side of a map is west.\n\nThe etymology of West can be traced back to the Old High German word westar, and perhaps to the Latin word vesper, meaning ""evening"", possibly derived from the Greek Hesperos."
"Does Japaneses live in the future meanwhile Latinamericans live in the past?
There are about 12 hours of difference, for example in Japan is Sunday meanwhile in Latinamerica is still Saturday.
Neither are true - we ALL live in the present, no matter where we are!\n\nRegarding the 12-hour difference example you gave...it all depends on what's called the point of reference.  Here's an illustration.  Suppose someone is riding in a car traveling down the highway at 55 miles per hour.  You are passing them in your car, which is going 60 MPH.  As this is happening, you both pass a construction worker on the side of the road.\n\nHow fast are you moving?  It depends who you ask!\n*The construction worker, from his point of reference, would say 60 MPH.\n*The driver of the car you are passing, from HIS point of reference, sees you moving at (60-55) = 5 MPH\n\nWho's right?  They both are!  (from their point of reference)\n\nNow, let's ask the person in Japan the answer to your question.  He would say you are wrong - he is living in the PRESENT, and the Latin American is in the past.\n\nLet's ask the person in Latin America the same question.  He would ALSO say you are wrong!  he is living in the PRESENT, and both you and the person in Japan are living in the FUTURE!\n\nWho's right?  Everyone!  No matter who you ask, anywhere in the world, they are living in the PRESENT!\n\nMake sense?  Hope this helps."
"how do you forget someoene or something in your past and move on with the present?

You don’t have to forget something or someone to move on.  The past is what makes us who we are.  Even the bad things in the past help us develop into the people we are.\n\nThe past can be painful.  The best thing to do is talk with someone you trust.  Discuss what it is that is bothering you, and then decide on what you are going to do to fix it.  By taking an active roll in your healing process you can “move on” sooner and feel better about it."

The naming of your business could be one of the most important decisions you will make. A name's originality and legal availability will create a real asset value of its own, as it becomes marketed and gains market acceptance. \n\nThe name you choose will become the focal point of all the benefits and features that relate to your business.

"Which three are the most predominant in the refrigerator (convection, conduction, or radiation)?

Convection and conduction are both important.  Radiation is negligible.  Heat is transported from the inside air to the refrigerant, and from the refrigerant to the outside air, through two heat exchangers.  In each exchanger, heat is transferred by a mixture of convection and conduction* between refrigerant and heat exchanger tubing, conduction through the walls of the tubing, and convection* (which may be forced by a fan) between the tubing and the air.  \n*Some may disagree with my interpretation of which kinds of heat transfer dominate each of these phases; it's a judgment call.  If most of the heat transfer is due to motion of the fluid (refrigerant or air) it's convection; if not it's conduction."
"what is a trait that is controlled by more than one pair of genes?

Some traits are determined by the combined effect of more than one pair of genes.  These are referred to as polygenic, or continuous, traits.  An example of this is human stature.  The combined size of all of the body parts from head to foot determines the height of an individual.  There is an additive effect.  The sizes of all of these body parts are, in turn, determined by numerous genes.   Human skin, hair, and eye color are also polygenic traits because they are influenced by more than one allele at different loci.  The result is the perception of continuous gradation in the expression of these traits.\n\nWhoops!  I didn't realize I used the same source as the answer above!  :o)  Sorry."

"can two lorenz curves (L(0)=0, L(1)=1, convex and increasing in (0,1) ) intersect at more than once in (0,1)?
Lorenz curves are functions defined in [0,1] such that they are positive, increasing, and convex on that interval.  Also, L(0)=0 and L(1)=1. Can two lorenz curves intersect at more than one point? if not, how would one proove it?
Yes, it is quite possible. First imagine such a curve and take a tangent line at an interior point. Now move that line up slightly so it intersects the original function at two nearby points. Finally let the line curve very slightly between those intersection points and join the resulting curve to (0,0) and (1,1) smoothly. Specific examples should be easy with this intuition.\n\nI'm guessing that any number of intersection points are possible. Just modify this proceedure between intersection points."
"How do I bring my friend into my business idea and make her a partner? What does being partners entail?
I want to open a consignment store and artists co-op in my town, but I'm not sure exactly how to go about the business end of it. I want to bring my friend into this as my business partner, but I don't really know what that means! Do we each come up with half the capital? Split the money we make? How do we divvy up responsibilities? Any info anyone has about business partnerships would be greatly appreciated!
HI.  I think you're off to a great start so far!  You'd be surprised as to how many people don't ask themselves and each other those same questions before starting a partnership/business.  What you have to do is take those questions and form a business plan that answers all of them and any more you come up with along the way.  A business plan will help you decide how you will split money, costs, responsibilities, and so much more.  I often tell people who want to start their own business that a business plan is great to have, but the best part is in creating one.  During that creation process you and your partners will ""forecast"" your needs and expectations which will act as a valuable guide down the line.  This way, you have your plan in writing and there is less of a chance for a ""he said/ she said"" type of conflict typical of a business where everyone just jumped in without anyone knowing what belongs to who or who does what.  \nTo answer your question more directly, you and your friend decide how it all works.  You can go 50-50, for example.  Or you can go 25-75 too.  It all depends on how much risk you want to both share or not share for that matter.  Obviously, if you put in 75% of the money for everyday costs, I would expect you'd want 75% of the profits.  However, it doesn't always have to be that way.  You can put in 75% (for example) of the startup costs but decide to split the profits 50-50.  Another consideration is a ""buy-out"" clause.  Should one of you decide that you no longer want to be part of the business, the other should have the option to buy out his or her partner.  It's all up to you and your partner.  Just make sure to put it in writing (in a contract, formal or informal), signed by all parties involved, and a couple of witnesses.  Include your full names, the dates, and your business plan.

"Does it snow in Morganton, Georgia at Christmas time? HELP!!?
Also, if you happen to know, are the Blue Ridge Mountains really close to there...Its kinda important, so please hurry
I don't know. I am in the Blue Ridge Mtns. and I am farther north. It snows here once in a while and very seldom on Christmas. So, it's very likely it won't snow there either. What large city is it near? That isn't a familiar place to me. The mountains aren't mush in GA. You have to be in NC, TN, VA, KY, and north for the mountains to be the real thing.

if you believe in god and you say no you will live but if you say yes you will be beheaded what will your anwser be? Mine is going to be yes because I have much faith in jesus and god

"Fellow Christians, I am struggling?
I am really struggling with the whole Ted Haggard thing.  Shouldn't Pastors and Priest be held to a higher standard?  I know we are all human but how can we listen to a follower of Christ who commits such blasphemy?  These are the things that make others call us hypocrites; he just took all of us one step back in the minds of the secular world.  He has caused so much damage.  How can I get past this?
You get past this by taking the opportunity to FORGIVE him.  Many times, the hardest thing we can do is forgive when we believe someone is so much in the wrong.\n\nAs you grow in your faith, you must always remember that part of you remains human...and vulnerable to temptation.  \n\nHow can you listen?  Heed the word and not the messenger.  God is able to use the most evil to do His will.\n\nHeld to a higher standard?  If they are truly called by God to that position, then they are there by God's will.  Who are we to know if his (T.H.) was a true calling or just his attempt to mask his inner desires/lusts?  \n\nTry to look at this as YOUR opportunity to openly profess your faith in the one true God, and salvation thru His Son, Jesus.  Nobody claims to be perfect when becoming Christian.  Just forgiven.  \n\nThe things that others call us remain the same.  Sometimes the noise is louder than other times.  Sometimes not.  Don't be distracted by them.\n\nPray for him and his family.  And forgive him with all of your heart."
"can anyone help me translate the following from Russian into English?
Пекло, и берег был высок.\nС подплывшей лодки цепь упала\nЗмеей гремучею - в песок,\nГремучей ржавчиной - в купаву.\n\nИ вышли двое. Под обрыв\nХотелось крикнуть им: ""Простите,\nНо бросьтесь, будьте так добры,\nНе врозь, так в реку, как хотите.\n\nВы верны лучшим образцам.\nКонечно, ищущий обрящет.\nНо... бросьте лодкою бряцать:\nВ траве терзается образчик"".
I see you are trying to translate the poem by Boris Pasternak. The translation is not exactly easy since some of the words either do not have direct translation or old Russian words that are no longer widely used. Plus he also plays with meanings of some words. All of the translations above are generic and done by online translators, which most of the times just translate separate words and, as a result, the whole text makes no sense. Here is my attempt to translate it.\n\nBaked (meaning 'it was really hot), and the coast was high. From the swum up boat the chain has fallen like a snake  - in sand, with the rattling rust - in water lilies (kupava, if I am not mistaken, is a flower similar to water lilies, or just some sort of plant that grows close to water or on water but close to the coast).\n\nAnd two appeared. I wanted to shout to them under the precipice (the break of the cliff): ""Forgive me, be so are kind as to throw if not separate, than into river, as you wish.\n\nYou are true to the best samples. Certainly, that walking will find. But... Stop making noise with your boat, there is a  образчик (it usually means a sample, but here I would guess the author means a person that serves as an example  / a holder of certain great qualities) tormented in the grass.\n\nIt's not a great translation. But then again, this poem is a great example how rich Russian language is, and that it cannot always be translated word by word, even sentence by sentence."

"How long after a tick bite would you start to see symptoms?
I found a tick in my arm about a week ago and I'm now starting to feel, well, yucky.  Chills and a stomach ache and some other flu-like symptoms.  Am I being paranoid or should I call the doc?  We did get the tick out by the way, and all of it did come out.
If you are concerned about lyme disease, then those symptoms usually occur 2 weeks after an infected deer tick bite.  The first symptoms that you typically see are rash and fever, although, you could also feel achey as well.  The best idea is to see you Dr.  A lyme screen is a fairly simple and quick laboratory test."

"why do the elderly detect air flow resistance later than the young?
please can you provide references
If you mean breathing trouble and restriction to their air way, it's because of a few reasons. Reflexes slow over time as well as brain signals, this means that they realize it slightly later and react somewhat slower, adding up to a notable difference. Also, many senses begin to fade with age, taste is one of them. So, it makes for a reasonable assumption to think that other areas very close to the mouth (IE the throat) would begin losing some sensations or have a slowing in the process of expelling things."

"Why did she not want me? Why am i such a bad person?
When i was ten my mom decided she didn't want to be a mom anymore.  She was a single mom, i never met my dad and my mom didnt even tell him at all about me.  I have no clue who he is.  I live with my uncle who is very nice to me.  I just found out that my mom died in a car accident she was drunk.  My mom was an alocholic.  i am soooo angery for leaving me how can i be so angery when she is dead.  Why am i such a bad person?
It doesn't have anything to do with what kind of person you are. It is the kind of person she was that caused her to give you up. Perhaps, because she was an alcoholic, she knew that she would not be able to be the responsible, loving parent you deserved.\nIt's normal to have some anger towards her. But, think of the kind of life you would have had if you were raised by an alcoholic. Most children of alcoholics do not have very pleasant lives. Often, there is abuse and neglect. At the very least, there is the humiliation that comes with an alcoholic parent. When someone is drunk they don't really care what they do or say, or about who witnesses it.\nLook at it like this, you would have had more pain had you been raised by her. Instead, you have a loving uncle that cares about you. Try to focus on that and let go of the pain and anger you feel towards her."

Typically, you go ""on"" a diet and can't wait to get ""off"" a diet.\n\nYou need to change your lifestyle.  What you are doing now isn't working - at all!\n\nYou need to clean up your environment - get rid of all the junk food in the house, in your car, in your desk drawer and anywhere else you have a stash.  Junk foods like:  chips, candy, pretzels, popcorn, ice cream, white bread, potatoes, pasta, rice.\n\nGet your butt out the door and exercise!  Don't have time - yes you do - you are the one that sets  your schedule - make time - at least 30 minutes a day for exercise - regular scheduled exercise at least 3 times (better to do it 5 times) a week.\n\nYour health will improve dramatically, you will lose weight, you will have more energy than you even thought possible.  \n\nThe good news is it is ALL under you control - the bad news is its ALL under your control.

Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.\n   4. Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.\n   5. I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\n   6. Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.\n   7. Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?\n   8. If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.\n   9.

We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.\n  12. While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.\n  13. A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.\n  14. My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.\n  15.

Hit the sack \n  \n  Meaning: To go to bed, to retire for the evening to sleep. \nExample: Man, am I bushed, I'm going to hit the sack. \nOrigin: Although fallen out of common usage, one definition of a sack is a bed.

It could be a fungus.  So try using a foot spray for that and deoderant foot spray.  If your feet sweat, you may want to see about wearing a different pair of shoes every other day so they have a chance to air out and dry.  Sometimes ""cheap"" shoes has a way of making feet stinky.  I think it's because your feet can't breathe.  I don't know for sure.  I used to get my son shoes at Payless and his feet always seemed to be stinky.  Someone told me it could be the material of the shoes.  So I took him to Famous Footwear and spent the extra money on his shoes. We've done all of the above I mentioned above and we haven't had a problem since."

Don't take it into physics, try some new way of answer.OK
Potential energy is stored energy. Once you'll know the potential energy of things, you can make use of this in many applications. It just like knowing your potential to burp many times, you'll show this off to your friends to be cool. Or knowing the potential of your dog to bark and bully someone, you'll bring your dog to your enemies to scare them away!\n\nOn a more serious side, knowing the potential energy of your food (through calories content) will let you know how much energy can you get if you are going to eat them. So, when you are going to have lots of physical activities, you are going to eat these energy giving foods to keep you going."

I had the same problem when I first moved here (Texas).  I came from Upstate New York, where guys are way more foreward---  people are more reserved here in that way, it seems.

So nearshighted people need glasss that will help to make the rays so ""CONCAVE"" lens are used these help direct the rays to directly to the retina, these lens .\nNearshighted people either have eye balls that are to long or there eye ball lens is to fat (convex), so they only see near objects clearly. the light rays are nneded to be spread out befor they reach the eye the glasse dos this.\n\n\nFarsightedness- persons only see far objects clarely but not nar objects, this is because there eye ball is to short of there eyeball lens are to thin(concave)  (use diagram lins bellow)\nSo the ray incoming are needed to fucos on the retina, So CONVEX lenses bring these rays toger so thay can fall on the retina"

"Is it possible to create perpetually working generators in zero gravity space where friction is almost zero?
Please take the right import of my question, I mean to say that, In space masses  tends to loose weight, and it is wholly in the hands of astronouts to experiment, as to how exactly the magnetic force of  magnet of generator  could oppose the perpetual motion as it starts?? once it is started?
At its simplest, a generator involves a spinning object inside a coil, and produces electricity.  It's tempting to think that if there were no friction, that the spinning object would turn forever always generating electricity, but that's not the case.\n\nWhen energy is extracted from the generator, it is because the generator is producing a current in its coil.  This current in the coil creates a magnetic field that actually slows down the spinning object.  Friction isn't the only force slowing down the system, it's not even an important force.  The important force is this electromagnetic braking force which arises as a direct and unavoidable consequence of the extraction of energy from the generator."

It's completely understandable since you waited until you were married to go for it(congrats on that by the way).I suggest just telling him to slow down and try to enjoy the moment more. Once he starts relaxing he'll come around..I promise :0)"
"why do so many americans seem  ignorant to other cultures?
My dad's in the military and so I've traveled a lot and experienced many different cultures. I just wander why Americans (mostly teenagers) seem to be so closed minded when it comes to other nationalities, ethnicities, cultures, etc.?
a poor education system that focuses too much on America and little else. many of them are completely clueless about other countries and cultures. e.g. lots of them think of Europe as one country and think you can drive all over it in one week and see it all. A supposedly intelligent adult office worker in America once asked my Scottish friend if they have computers in Scotland! I rest my case."
"What's your opinion on global warming effects on polar bears and what can be done to stop it?
opinions on what you think of global warming effects on polar bears. What things should be done to protect? How to do these things and why you feel so strongly about this subject?? help help
in my opinion is it doesn't exist. because think about it we are coming out of an ice age. it makes sense doesn't it? fact: there have been ice ages. fact: there is a lot of ice in ice ages. so if you know about water then you know the same amount of it is here that was here when the earth began so literally it is dinosaurs piss. well during an ice age lots of stuff is covered in water/ice ( i know i live in Minnesota and it is known that it was fully covered with ice.). so where is all the water? in ice bergs, glaciers, etc. so it would make sense that to leave an ice age most things would melt right? so they are still melting they will finish melting and cover parts of the world, then it will slowly freeze causing an ice age. why would humans make that big of a difference? we are insignificant to the world.(everyone in the world could fit in Texas and it would only be as densely populated as NY city). so our vehicles and combustible engines couldn't have that big of an effect. but you say ""what about the ozone thinning?"" well i am not saying it hasn't but it was because of the CFC's(chloral floral carbons) which broke up the ozone by attaching to ozone molecules. but the CFC's are no longer around. the ozone is healing itself as it is meant too. their was no real hole only a thinning which is also bad. but now it is closing up and returning to normal. if you think that the co2 we produced cant be good well think about it it isn't that much and while the earth was cooling after being created it released tons of co2. so what people will notice in the next 1-9000 years is it will warm up but in that time it will also cool down and eventually there will be an ice age. just because the great human race is here doesn't mean that the earth will stop having ice ages as it has done by its self for billions of years. think about it. am i a genius or what i mean i just looked at what has happened in history wow who would have thought history would repeat its self\n\nnow to give you sorces and go into more depth on what i just wrote\n\nwell lets see first. ice ages.\n\nAn ice age is a period of long-term downturn in the temperature of Earth's climate, resulting in an expansion of the continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers (""glaciation""). Glaciologically, ice age is often used to mean a period of ice sheets in the northern and southern hemispheres; by this definition we are still in an ice age (because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist). More colloquially, when speaking of the last few million years, ice age is used to refer to colder periods with extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents: in this sense, the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. This article will use the term ice age in the former, glaciological, sense; and use the term 'glacial periods' for colder periods during ice ages and 'interglacial' for the warmer periods.\nMany glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years, initially at 40,000-year frequency but more recently at 100,000-year frequencies. These are the best studied. There have been four major ice ages in the further past.\nso we are in an ice age interesting that means it is warming up. well that is my argument but there is more so i will continue.\n\noh my sorce for the above exerpt is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_age... so go there and read more if u want\n\nhere is more reading on ice ages\nhttp://library.thinkquest.org/j001457/fa...\nhttp://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/i...\nhttp://www.geologyshop.co.uk/iceages.htm...\ni am not making this up ice ages exist this is the basis to my argument.\n\nthen i said there is ice and water and the same amount of water is here that was millions of years ago again not made up\n\nThere is about the same amount of water on Earth now as there was millions of years ago.\nsource: http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/"
"Attention Zoologists! This is a query about Gizzard in Birds. Kindly read below.....?
Graminivorous birds( grain eating birds like pigeon and sparrow.)have a grain mill or gizzard as a part of their digestive system to grind the whole grains to powder (remember they do not have teeth in the beak!). They also gulp down tiny stones to aid and abet the process of grinding.\n\nNow , my question is -- Is a gizzard a constant feature of all birds'digestive system? Do we find it in the carnivorous birds like vulture, hawks and the like? Kindly enlighten me.\nThank you.
Yes, all birds have gizzards. In most birds the food passes rapidly through the glandular stomach (proventriculus) and stays for some time in the muscular stomach (gizzard) while the gastric secretions (pepsin, HCl and mucus) are at work. In most species the gizzard is complex and has two pairs of opposing muscles. However, birds of prey and Ciconiiformes have a simpler muscular stomach. Also, some birds have a third chamber below the muscular stomach (pyloric stomach), for instance many aquatic species. \n\nCheck this 1997 paper about the gastrointestinal physiology and nutrition of wild birds, it has drawings of the digestive tract of different species (free access):\nhttp://docstore.ingenta.com/cgi-bin/ds_deliver/1/u/d/ISIS/29326609.1/cabi/pns/1997/00000056/00000003/art00028/B9A3D9F840D5656211481333362A0ED16C47E714CF.pdf?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/error/delivery&format=pdf )\nIf the link doesn't work, download from here: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cabi/pns/1997/00000056/00000003/art00028\n\nOther references:\nSeasonal changes in gizzard size:\nhttp://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v092n03/p0794-p0795.pdf\nLess muscular gizzard in birds that eat pollen and nectar (abstract only):\nhttp://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/90/paper/ZO9900581.htm"

"What is the science behind to peculier behaviour of water that does not expands from 0^c to 4^c and then expan

The primary reason water expands upon freezing is the breakage of hydrogen bonds.  The hydrogen bonding which occurs in the polar water molecules acts to bind water molecules closer together than they would otherwise.  When freezing, though, those hydrogen bonds must break in favor of the crystalline solid structure (which packs the molecules less densely).  Hydrogen bonding also leads to the extremely high boiling point of water for such a small molecule (most molecules of small molecular weight are gases at much lower temperatures than 100 deg C).\n\nIn fact, hydrogen bonding contributes to just about every unusual property of water.  There are very few molecules in nature that exhibit hydrogen bonding; and none, to my knowledge, exhibit it as strongly as water.  Alcohols have some hydrogen bonding, which is why they have higher boiling points than other, comparable molecular weight organics."

"Is mind a separate entity?

A reasonable answer could be given if you believe in soul concept.\n \nI think Mind indeed is a separate entity but in spiritual realm. In physical realm....Mind and our body functions are interrelated. Thoughts arise in Mind, then we weigh the thoughts(good vs. bad) and then we do the action(either physical or mental). Ofcourse all these things happen very fast.\n\nI dont think thoughts arise only from what we see. What about dreams that we get. Sometimes the dreams are so wierd that its unlike anything we have clearly seen and remembered. Ofcoruse it the characters in the dream might be familiar but the story or incident that we get in dreams are some times so wierd that it did not happen but its very well orchestrated. I think Mind can manifest its own story sometimes without us seeing or hearing at that moment."
"What is the differance between Mormans and Christanity?

Mormons were started by a man named Joe Smith in the 1800s. When Joe was a teenager he used to try to con people with ""peep"" stones that he claimed gave him psychic sight. His dad was a treasure hunter and the community they lived in petitioned to drive them out. The petition particularly cited Joe as a person of low moral character.\n\nJoe tried to convince his family that he saw two angels in the woods. His family dismissed it as another one of his cons. He read books and novels about Jews escaping the grip of the Egypitians and Romans by moving to other lands. This gave him the idea of Jews coming to North America later. Later he began to tell people he saw the two angels in the woods story again. He later changed it and said they were in fact Jehovah and Jesus. Then later changed it angels again. He actually started to gather a small following of people. He paid a Professor to ""validate"" golden tablets he claimed God showed him hidden in the woods that gave another book to the bible. The book Doctrine and Covenants describes the professor and the translating. In reality the professor later confessed to his colleague in a letter that his statements were false and there was not tablets or translating.\n\nAnyhow as the story was told Joe hid in a room away from the professor and used his peep stones to translate Greek and Hebrew gold tablets into English. Now these tablets were supposidly stories wrote by Jews in America ranging in 2000bc to 400ad. Strangely enough the book of Mormon translated straight from Greek and Hebrew alledgely ended up in 1600s Queen's English just like the King James Version of the bible. Not only that but even quotes the KJV exactly in many passages and even shares the same chapter number and verse. The question is why would they translate into Queen's English when 1800s had modern English and use the exact KJV passages, even ones that were mis-translated by the King James translators. Also why would the chapter and verses match up in numbers when chapter/verse numbers were not added till the English versions of the bible.\n\nSo Joe wrote his book of Mormon but made some serious mistakes in it. First of all he addresses the issue of having another book of the bible. According to the book of Mormon the Jews of 33ad when they met Jesus asked why they needed more bibles. The term bible is Latin for ""small books"" and did not exist at that time. So why is a word used in the book of Mormon in 33ad that did not exist and further the book of Mormon was supposed to be in Greek and Hebrew not Latin? Another mistake was Jesus showed the American Jews he visited shortly after his crucifixion, the nail prints in his hands to prove he was the messiah. The problem here is these people did not see the crucifixion so how would nail prints prove anything to them?\n\nAnother good one is the book of Mormon claims that when Jesus was crucified he went to North America and for three days he caused darkness to where not even torches could be lit. He flew around screaming and destroying countless cities of the American Jews. After three days of mayhem he finally calmed down and decided to talk to the people. According to the bible Jesus went to the belly of the earth for 3 days before resurrecting. The darkness at the crucifixion lasted for 10 hours and was a fairly local event. Other cultures do not report darkness as Israel did at that time.\n\nThe book of Mormon says Jesus was born in Jerusalem. The bible says Bethlehem. A Mormon bishop told me one time that prophets make mistakes and Joe simply made a mistake. I told him how could it be a mistake when it is translated from golden tablets distributed by God? Prophets that make mistakes are called false prophets.\n\nBut the most damaging evidence of its falesness is the fact that no North/South Native American Indian has any history even remotely validating any claim by the book of Mormon. There is no archaeological evidence of the c"

"What do you exactly define a 'black hole' as? What is it made of?
If you can, please do suggest a few websites related to the same.
black hole \n\nIn astronomy, celestial object of such extremely intense gravity that it attracts everything near it and in some instances prevents everything, including light, from escaping. The term was first used in reference to a star in the last phases of gravitational collapse (the final stage in the life history of certain stars; see stellar evolution) by the American physicist John A. Wheeler. \n\nGravitational collapse begins when a star has depleted its steady sources of nuclear energy and can no longer produce the expansive force, a result of normal gas pressure, that supports the star against the compressive force of its own gravitation. As the star shrinks in size (and increases in density), it may assume one of several forms depending upon its mass. A less massive star may become a white dwarf, while a more massive one would become a supernova. If the mass is less than three times that of the sun, it will then form a neutron star. However, if the final mass of the remaining stellar core is more than three solar masses, as shown by the American physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland S. Snyder in 1939, nothing remains to prevent the star from collapsing without limit to an indefinitely small size and infinitely large density, a point called the ""singularity."""
"Can someone show me in the New testament, where homosexuality is considered a sin?
All I can find, for a Christian to get to heaven, is that they accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.  I think Man is adding on his own ideas because anything different scares him.
the funny thing is, the original text of the OLD testament didn't say anything about homosexuality being a sin either. the part that's commonly translated to say ""a man should not lie with another man as he would lie with a woman, that is detestable"" was originally mistranslated on PURPOSE when some homophobic church leaders got together to write the king james version...the original hebrew text translates to ""a man should not lie with another man in a woman's bed, that is unclean"". so basically there's no restriction on who can have sex with whom, just where they are allowed to do it."

"what is the difference between a RT-PCR and PCR?

RT stands for Reverse Transcription, which refers to the key difference between the two. In PCR the DNA is heated so the strands separate, starting sections called primers attach, and then polymerase finishes out the strand, duplicating the amount of a particular section of DNA. This is then repeated many times, until you have millions of one (or more) sections.\n\nWith RT-PCR, you start out with RNA instead of DNA. Reverse transcriptase is then used to build DNA from the RNA, which is then duplicated through the process above."

"I need a small sumary on air mass? I really,really need your help!?

nice question!!- i myself hadn't heard that thing...but finally got afetr some searchin... Hope this is wat u are lookin for.\nHeres the answer \n\nAir mass\n\nIn meteorology, an air mass is a large volume of air having fairly uniform characteristics of temperature, atmospheric pressure, and water vapor content. Air masses cover many hundreds or thousands of square miles, and slowly change in accordance with the terrain they are over.\n\nAir masses are classified according to their temperature and moisture content. The terms Arctic, Polar, and Tropical define the temperature of an air mass with arctic being the coldest and tropical being the warmest. Maritime air is a moist air mass, whereas Continental air is relatively dry. These terms are combined; For example a maritime tropical air mass would be warm and moist. The terms refer to the fact that air masses acquire the properties of the terrain over which they move. Thus, cold arctic air masses are most common in the arctic regions and maritime air masses generally form over water. Air masses do move however, and a maritime air mass that moves over land will slowly lose its moisture and eventually become continental, just as a tropical air mass that moves north will cool and become polar, or even arctic.\n\nAir masses can not be defined by perfect lines or borders, however there is a very small region of interaction of two or more air masses where mixing occurs. This region is called a weather front, and visible weather and significant weather changes will occur there. As air masses move and displace each other, the associated fronts also move, thus causing weather changes for the terrain below. Fronts are always named for the air mass that is advancing. Thus a cold front would occur where a cooler air mass is displacing a warmer one.\n\nAir masses are not to be confused with small scale events like microbursts. Though these smaller events do involve masses of air, the term air mass is reserved for weather systems that span large areas"

The fight to change laws is a long one, although not an imposible one.\n\nOne of the main things you need is ""stick-a-bility"".  When children come up with ideas like yours, adults know that as you get loder, your ideas will most likely change.  For this reason, they tend to not take you too seriously, figuring that when you are older, you will change your mind.\n\nThe best way to counter this is to test your own resovle on the matter.\n\nBe patient, and realise that the best way to change this law is to work at itall the way through till you are old enough to vote.  Then keep on going...choose career paths or other pastimes that get you the ""ears"" of people in power.\n\nOver time, if you stick at it, as an adult, you may be able to change perminantly the rights of children in the future.\n\nIt is always a long haul, but many have done it before you.\n\nGood Luck"

If it works for them, good for them. The problem comes when they insist on trying to convert me to their religion(christianity mostly). I can't stand it. I have to figure out what I believe on my own, and I do not feel I need a book to tell me what is right and wrong.\nI honestly believe that the athiests who lash out at christians are jealous. They want to have something that they can believe the way Christians believ in God. The crave it, but push it away, and hate those that embrace it.\n\n\n\n\nI am offended by ""smartarse"" below me. That is rude."

"What are all the details on copywriting and publishing a book?

Copyrighting is easy; all you need to do is be able to prove that you created the material before a certain date.  Actually, whenever you create the material you automatically have the copyright, but if you ever needed to prove it you would need a dated copy.\n\nThis will work: send a copy of the manuscript to yourself in the mail.  Take the parcel down to the post office and have the clerk stamp the parcel all over with the date.  Then send it to yourself.  When it arrives, just hang on to it and don't open it.  If you ever need to establish that you hold the copyright, you'll have a copy inside a dated envelope!\n\nAs for publishing, I have no idea."
"why is it, that even when you ask a simple question, like ""does god get angry?"" christians still can't agree?

All Christians interpret the Bible differently because it is so convoluted and contradictory.  They pick and choose which verses suit their own personal interests regardless of what anyone else thinks.  If the same one God was speaking the same words to everyone, then they should all have the same answer.  Clearly that isn't happening!  People are just using the bible as a weapon for their own gain."

Yes, a business plan is a living, working set of documents that not only indicate what a business is capable of doing, but should guide and direct its operation.

"Opinion of this quotation...?
""Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression...and sins."" Isaiah 58:1  \nto me, it means thatif I obey this verse, the world will be angered. People want to hear about God's love and mercy. People will accuse me of being self-righteous.   I want to know the truth - I am tired of being lied to - I enjoy being reproved and corrected to help me grow. WHat abt U?
The first time I read Isaiah 58, I cried.  And I'm misty reading it again just now.\n\nThis terribly sad Chapter is one of many oracles Isaiah was told to give the Jewish people.  The gist of the entire Chapter is this:  don't say with your mouth you love God, but prove with your actions you don't.  The people said they loved God and they even enjoyed seeking Him in prayer and fasting.  However, when they fasted, they did so for the wrong reasons and they indulged in physical pleasures and iniquity, such as refusing to pay their laborers.  God sees right through this hypocrisy and insists that Isaiah yell his condemnatory message from the rooftops.  The people hated him for it, just as they hated Jeremiah and the rest of the prophets.  And, of course, Jesus.\n\nYes, the world will be angered when you announce its iniquities as if you are blowing a trumpet.  Some, however, will be moved to repentance.  That's what encourages me.\n\nPeace and love in Jesus."

"How do people get arthritis?

As far as osteoarthritis, it is a wear-and tear arthritis that is likely caused by stress on the joints over a period of years (that's why you tend to get it when you are older).\n\nRheumatoid arthritis, however, is an autoimmune disease, and doctors are unsure of its causes.  Some think it may be a reaction to an infection that triggers the overactive immune system to attack the bodies own joints, but there is no way to be sure.  Some blame it on environmental toxins.  There is likely a genetic factor that contributes as well.\n\nCheck out http://www.arthritis.org for information on the over 100 types of arthritis, their symptoms treatments, and possible causes.\n\nPS - No, you don't get arthritis from popping your knuckles (in case that's what you were thinking).\n\nPPS - I'm not sure where onebeeswax got the info, and it could be a present theory for causes of arthritis, but I have done lots of reading on it since I was diagnosed with RA a year ago, and talked with my rheumatologist, and I've never heard of that specific theory.  At best it is a guess, and I would not take that answer as an actual cause for arthritis.  But it is an interesting theory."
"is the reaction between HCl and Calcium trioxo carbonate endothermic or exothermic?
you could by telling me the how the reaction cylinder feel during the experiment.........does it usually feel cold or warm.......an answer 2 that would be of useful help :)
The formula would be 2HCL+ CaCO3 ---> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2. The standard enthalpies of formation are -167.2, -1207, -796, -285.8, and -393.5 respectively. When you use the formula ""Sum of products minus sum of reactants, you come up with +66.1 (don't forget to multiply the HCl formation by 2 for 2 moles). I am assuming that the HCl you are talking about is HCl (aq) and not HCl (g). If it is a gas, then the standard enthalpy of formation is -92.31, so you would come up with a different number (-83.68)\n\nIf it is aqueous HCl, you come up with a positive 66.1 kJ/mole, which means that heat was absorbed by the reaction (endothermic). That probably means your cylinder would feel cooler, since heat is being taken in by the reaciton.\n\nIf you mean gaseous HCl, you come up with a negative 83.68 kJ/mol, which means that heat was given off by the reaction (exothermic). That probably means yoru cylinder woudl feel warmer, since heat is being given off by the reaciton and taken in by the cylinder."
"Climatology?
I AM AT SCHOOL AND I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN SOME FACTS ABOUT CLIMATOLOGY BECAUSE THERES A LOT I DONT KNOW PLZ HELP ME AHHHHHHHHH
Climatology is the study of climate, scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time, and is a branch of the atmospheric sciences. In contrast to meteorology, which studies short term weather systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency with which these weather systems occurred in the past. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. Climatologists, those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates - local, regional or global - and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help predict future climate change.\n\nsee :\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology\n\nhttp://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/sci/climatology.html\n\nhttp://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/climatology.html\n\nhttp://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/climate.html\n\nhttp://www.usq.edu.au/sciences/biophysci/futurestudents/climatology/default.htm\n\nhttp://www.sciencekomm.at/bio/assoc/climatology.html"

"How do I know if I hurt my cyadic muscle?
My left leg is sore and tingly, especially around my hamstring and also around my ankle.
There's no such thing as a cyadic muscle. I think you're probably talking about the SCIATIC NERVE which is a large nerve which supplies muscles all down the back of your leg.\n\nThe sciatic nerve is made up of lots of nerve fibres which come out of the spinal column through very small gaps. Sometimes, they get irritated coming through the gaps, which leads to so called ""sciatica"" - a pain which extends from the buttocks down the back of the legs, right down to the foot. The best way to check if you have an irritated nerve is to lie on your back, and raise one leg as high as you can, then pull your foot back towards you. If you get pain in your back, it's probably the nerve which is affected. If you get pain down the back of your knee, it's not nerve related, it's just the muscles."

"acetylecholine and atropine mechanism?

The chemical compound acetylcholine, often abbreviated as ACh, was the first neurotransmitter to be identified. It is a chemical transmitter in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) in many organisms including humans.\n\nAtropine is a tropane alkaloid extracted from the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) and other plants of the family Solanaceae. It is a secondary metabolite of these plants and serves as a drug with a wide variety of effects. Being potentially deadly, it derives its name from Atropos, one of the three Fates who, according to Greek mythology, chose how a person was to die.\n\n\n\nGenerally, atropine lowers the ""rest and digest"" activity of all muscles and glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. (Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system.) Therefore, it may cause swallowing difficulties and reduced secretions.\nOphthalmic use\nTopical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze accommodation, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 2 to 3 days, so tropicamide is generally preferred as a mydriatic. In atropine-induced mydriasis, the mechanism of action involves blocking the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle (which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release), thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine is contraindicated in patients predisposed to narrow angle glaucoma.\n\n[edit]\nResuscitation\nInjections of atropine are used in the treatment of bradycardia (an extremely low heart rate), asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in cardiac arrest. This works because the main action of the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic system on the heart is to slow it down. Atropine blocks that action and therefore may speed up the heart rate.\n\nThe main action of the parasympathetic nervous system is to stimulate the M2 muscarinic receptor in the heart, but atropine inhibits this action.\n\n[edit]\nSecretions and brochoconstriction\nAtropine's actions on the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits salivary, sweat, and mucus glands. This can be useful in treating Hyperhidrosis and can prevent the death rattle of dying patients, even though it has not been officially indicated for either of these purposes.\n\n[edit]\nAntidote for organophosphate poisoning\nBy blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, atropine also serves as an antidote for poisoning by organophosphate insecticides and nerve gases. Troops who are likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry autoinjectors with atropine and obidoxime which can be quickly injected into the thigh. It is often used in conjuntion with Pralidoxime chloride.\n\nSome of the nerve gases attack and destroy acetylcholinesterase, so the action of acetylcholine becomes prolonged. Therefore, atropine can be used to reduce the effect of ACh.\n\n[edit]\nSide effects and overdoses\nAdverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, giddiness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, and possibly, notably in the elderly, confusion, hallucinations and excitation. These latter effects are due to the fact that atropine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is very dangerous.\n\nIn overdoses, atropine is poisonous. Atropine is sometimes added to other potentially addictive drugs; abuse of those drugs is then prevented by the unpleasant effects of atropine overdose.\n\nAtropine can cause heart rate slowing when given at very low doses, presumably as a result of a weak partial agonist effect at the cardiac muscarinic receptors.\n\n\nT"

Sounds like youve got a nasty integral. Your going to have to integrate a polar vector in cartesian coordinates. Write the B field in cartesian and then integrate one side of the square.\n\nB.ds= miu (0) * I is true. I forget which theorem but I think its stokes theorem from vector calculus. It doesnt matter which shape you choose. The symmetry of the circle allows a simple integral because there is no dot product for the B.s since they are always parrallel. Choosing a square just makes your life horrible. If you correctly write the B field and then use the vector identity:\n\ncos theta = a.b/(|a||b|)\n\nto find the angle for the dot product you will get the same answer.

""You want your cake and eat it too"" means that you don't want to have to make a decision but you want to do something both ways, or have two options.  For instance - people might refer to a man who can't commit to one woman this way, because he may want a relationship, but he still wants to date other women.  Just an example."
"what does BAHAMUT mean?
I saw somebody named their cat Bahamut. what language is this and what does it mean?
Bahamut (Arabic: بهموت‎ Bahamūt) is a giant omnipotent being in Arabic mythology. Bahamut rides on a giant whale creature called Liwash that resides in a vast sea, the Adwad. He supports a huge bull named Kujuta who has four thousand eyes, and the same number of ears, noses, mouths, tongues and feet. The distance between each is a five hundred years' journey. Kujuta supports on him a rock of ruby, atop which stands an angel who supports the seven heavens."
"I got hit over the eye with a softbal. How do i make the swelling less visible?
Under my eyebrow is swollen so my eye is smaler on one side than the other.
Advil will actually help reduce swelling and reduce/remove the bruise faster. My friend injured her elbow and had a very large bruise from a fall. The doctor actually prescribed advil 2 at a time every 4-6 hours for 3-5 days to reduce swelling and bruising because it thins the blood a bit and helps break up the bruise faster."

"How did scientists find out that water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen?

One of the earliest attempts to explain the nature of water was made by the Greek philosopher Aristotle in 335 B.C. when he issued his Theory of Matter. According to Aristotle's theory, every substance was a combination of four basic elements—fire, earth, air and water. This idea was to keep alchemists busy for centuries trying to change common metals into gold by rearranging their ""elements."" They were not very successful, however, since no one was ever able to break down a substance and find out just how much fire, earth, air and water was in it. Not until the eighteenth century did scientists decide that air, earth and fire were not really elements at all, and in 1781 a British chemist proved that water wasn't an element either.\n\nThat year Joseph Priestley exploded a mixture of air and hydrogen in a bottle as ""a mere random experiment to entertain a few philosophical friends,"" and noted with interest that the explosion caused moisture to condense inside the bottle. He repeated the experiment until he was certain that the moisture was produced from the reaction of air and hydrogen, thereby proving that water, rather than being a basic element, was itself composed of other chemicals.\n\nIn 1783 the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier elaborated on Priestley's experiment and discovered that the hydrogen was not combining with air to form water, but only with the oxygen in air. Further experiments determined that a molecule of water contained two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, a chemical combination which has been given the symbol H2O.\n\nThe discovery that water was H2O or ""hydrogen oxide"" raised more questions than it answered, for chemists learned that despite its apparent simplicity water is actually a most puzzling and paradoxical substance which seems to defy the rules of chemistry.\n\nCompared to other liquids, water requires a great deal of heat to raise its temperature even a few degrees, and once it is warm it loses its heat slowly. This ability to ""store"" heat enables water to modify the world's climate. Oceans don't warm up as fast as the coastlines they touch, nor do the)' cool off as fast, with the result that coastal areas usually have milder winters and cooler summers than areas inland. For example, Bismarck, North Dakota has average temperatures of 8 degrees in January and 70 degrees in July, while Seattle, at the same latitude, has averages of 41 degrees and 66 degrees for the same two months.\n\nWater is the only substance found abundantly in all three natural forms—liquid, solid and gas. But in changing from one form to another some more peculiarities become evident. One of water's most paradoxical qualities is that when it changes into a solid it expands (and so becomes relatively lighter for its volume). Other substances, with the exception of bismuth, contract or condense and so become relatively heavier. Of course, if water condensed when it froze the world would have some serious problems. Ice would form on the bottom of a lake because it would be denser and therefore heavier than the liquid water. And there it would stay, growing upwards, killing all marine life. Underneath the surface, shielded from much of the sun's heat, very little of it would melt in the spring and eventually the rivers, lakes and seas in cooler parts of the world would become solid ice.\n\nThe world would have different but even greater temperature problems if there were no water vapor in the air to absorb the sun's heat during the day and retain it during the night. Daylight hours would be miserably hot, and nightfall would bring freezing temperatures. In southern states where winter crops are grown, farmers dread a cold, dry, clear night for this same reason. Without clouds and moist air to act as insulation, the earth's heat quickly escapes, permitting the temperature to drop unusually low and sometimes ruin citrus fruit and tender pl"
"I want to be an animal doctor....but................?
I love animals and I would dedicate my life to them. But to be a veternain (sp?) you have to be strong for the owner and you have to have a strong heart especially when you have to put them down And I'd faint if I see an injured animal or a seriuosly hurt one and I don't know if i could make it. That's my only doubt about be a V. ( i cant spell right now lol) I am soooooooooo sensitive when it comes to animals. Can anyone plz give me some advice for overcoming this......er.........fear maybe?  Thank you!\n\n\n\nP.S. Animals rule! :)
Well being a Veterinarian is a difficult row to hoe so to speak. It is more difficult then becoming a doctor as there are so many who want to do it, but so few schools available. Salaries after all that work are not that great either. 90% of all new vet students are female. I can tell you from my experience in medicine that I felt the same way as a young man and thought I could never get through it. Many people in the healing professions feel that way initially. But trust me you do get over it, especially when you get personally involved. I am not sure how to say this, but it just happens. All of those fears just seem to melt away. I can not guarantee anything but I will say it is worth a try for you to get involved with an animal rescue group during a summer or even right now if you can spare the time. You will easily find if you can truly help these animals as a healer or not. some really great reading if you have not done it yet is ""James Herriot's 4 Vol. Set (All Creatures Great and Small, All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, The Lord God Made Them All) "" It is a very none religious set of true stories about a British Vet in the 1930's. He tells it with such wit and wisdom that it just takes your breath away. Good luck to you whatever happens..."

"A,B 2railwayStn 48 hrs apart. Every 8 hrs trains leave each stn.U start 6am.How many trains from opp.dir U see
From A to B 48 hrs, same for B to A. 6am, 2pm, 10pm every day for opposite direction. So how many oppossing trains cross you and you may see them?
At the moment you first start your trip, every train that has left the other station in the last 48 hours is on the track, and will be seen by you.  As well, every train leaving the other station in the NEXT 48 hours will also be seen as you make your journey.  So, you will see every train which has left the other station over a 96-hour interval.  This is 96/8=12 trains.\n\nHowever, you also see one just as you leave (at time zero), so you would actually SEE 13 trains."
"Do you know what your ""spiritual gifts"" are?
I have talked to some Christians who have said they have certian spiritual gifts that they use to give Glory to God. Do you know what the different types are?  Can you have more than one?
There are several different spiritual gifts.  Like, the ability to teach wisdom and knowledge.  The gift to heal, the gift to BE healed, the gift of speaking in tongues, the gift of interpreting tongues, etc.  Anything that is givin to you from heaven is a spiritual gift, I feel.  You can definately have more than one- in fact we are to seek these gifts out.\n\nMy gifts are the ability to see spirits (actually I'd rather not see them), receiving knowledge from time to time (from a higher source), and public speaking.  I say public speaking because I prayed for this ability and received it recently.  It is amazing what the Lord will do for us."
"Though it is blood to blood contact but AIDS does not spread through mosquito biting. why?

First not enough blood is injested by the mosquito.\n\nSecondly,a mosquitos bite is actually two fold. \nThe first bite from one orifice injects a chemical/enzyme to stop the blood from clotting. This chemical is said to help neutralize the disease, this is what makes us itch from the bite. \nThen thru a different orifice the mosquito sucks a very, very small amount of blood and this blood is broken down inside the mosquito's body for food. The enymes of the mosquito make it impossible foir the HIV to live inside the mosquito."
"i had a wierd dream, and i need someone to help me figure this out?
black snake with legs and a red stripe on its head, strange roads, mom and dad, and the snake bit my 4 month old.
OK, here we go...\nAccording to Freud\nThe Snake is a phallic symbol, the legs emphasizing this.\nThe strange roads, if they are forking to the right and left, the right symbolizes moral goodness and purity, whle the left symbolizes deviance and perversion. Mom and Dad would represent guiding figures, possibly in an antagonistic fashion. The snke biting the 4 month old probably sybolizes the act of intercourse. That's according to Freud.\nA less sexually charged interpretation is that:\nThe Snake with legs symbolizes deception, it biting your child most likeley symbolizes that you fear your child will be hurt. The strange roads represent a period of uneasiness in your life, and the Parents represent the authority and guidance to help you along."
"A subway train has a sound intensity level of 90dB, and a rock band has a sound intensity level of about 110?
dB. How many times greater is the sound intensity of the band than the train?
Actually Decibels is a logarithmic scale so not as simple as normal calcualtion... the actual answer is 100 times louder...\n\nthe scale which is frequently used by physicists to measure intensity is a scale based on multiples of 10. This type of scale is sometimes referred to as a logarithmic scale. The scale for measuring intensity is the decibel scale. The threshold of hearing is assigned a sound level of 0 decibels (abbreviated 0 dB); this sound corresponds to an intensity of 1*10-12 W/m2. A sound which is 10 times more intense ( 1*10-11 W/m2) is assigned a sound level of 10 dB. A sound which is 10*10 or 100 times more intense ( 1*10-10 W/m2) is assigned a sound level of 20 db. A sound which is 10*10*10 or 1000 times more intense ( 1*10-9 W/m2) is assigned a sound level of 30 db. A sound which is 10*10*10*10 or 10000 times more intense ( 1*10-8 W/m2) is assigned a sound level of 40 db. \n\nSo something 90db is 10*10*10*10*10*10*10*10*10 times more intense or  1,000,000,000 times more intense.\nSomething 100db would be  10,000,000,000 (10 times louder)\nSometing 110db is  100,000,000,000 (10x10 times louder)\n\n\n\n\nObserve that this scale is based on powers or multiples of 10. If one sound is 10x times more intense than another sound, then it has a sound level which is 10*x more decibels than the less intense sound. The table below lists some common sounds with an estimate of their intensity and decibel level.\n\nSource Intensity Intensity \nLevel\n # of Times \nGreater Than TOH\n \nThreshold of Hearing (TOH) 1*10-12 W/m2 0 dB 100 \nRustling Leaves 1*10-11 W/m2 10 dB 101 \nWhisper 1*10-10 W/m2 20 dB 102 \nNormal Conversation 1*10-6 W/m2 60 dB 106 \nBusy Street Traffic 1*10-5 W/m2 70 dB 107 \nVacuum Cleaner 1*10-4 W/m2 80 dB 108 \nLarge Orchestra 6.3*10-3 W/m2 98 dB 109.8 \nWalkman at Maximum Level 1*10-2 W/m2 100 dB 1010 \nFront Rows of Rock Concert 1*10-1 W/m2 110 dB 1011 \nThreshold of Pain 1*101 W/m2 130 dB 1013 \nMilitary Jet Takeoff 1*102 W/m2 140 dB 1014 \nInstant Perforation of Eardrum 1*104 W/m2 160 dB 1016"

"When someone hears the word CULT?
When someone hears the word ""Cult"" or sees the word ""Cult"", why do people automaticly assume that it is something bad, when the definition in the ""Websters Dictionary"" of 1912 defines it as:\nA system of religious belief and worship.\n \nThat which was the religion of Moses is the ceremonial or cult of the religion of Christ.\n\nWhy do you think the new definitions of today say nothing about this?
You are right! Well done for noticing!\nThe true definition of this word has been deliberately altered and redefined by certain vested interests. The root of this word actually comes from the word CULTIVATE. (!)\nThe main purpose here is to create fear and alarm in the society, particularly western society. They have re positioned the word so that people will associate it with a general ""idea"" of something dangerous, that might attack them or cause them harm, or more importantly,undermine their religious beliefs.\nThere is an underlying reason why this is done, particularly in the area of religion, tho the ""redefinition"" of words is actually a common black propaganda tool in this society.\n\nConsider this:\nA society is capable of surviving for thousands of years unless it is attacked from within or without by hostile forces. Where such an attack occurs, the primary targets are it's religious and national gods and heroes,it's potential of leadership and the self respect and integrity of it's members.\nIf you look around you , you will find countless examples of these points. They scream at us every day from the newspapers and TV.\nProbably the most critical point of attack on a culture is it's religios experience. Where one can destroy or undermine religious institutions then the entire fabiric of the society can be quickly subverted or brought to ruin.\nFor the last hundred years or so religion has been beset with relentless attack. You have been told it’s the “opiate of the masses “, that it’s unscientific, that it is primitive, in short , that it is a delusion.\nThe source of this kind of attack is always covert and hidden. It is promoted by a few who have a vested interest in a slave society.\nUnfortunately these few rely on creating fear and insecurity in others\nto forward and promote their enemy properganda. These others feel correctly they have to defend themselves from an attack, but because the real enemy is hidden, they can be manipulated to attack what they really should be defending as they cannot see the real enemy.\n\nThe key here is that underneath all these attacks on organised religion there is one fundemental target:\nThe spirituality of man, your own basic spiritual nature, self respect and peace of mind."

I had a rear molar extracted this morning, at first I was okay but after leaving the dentists practice on my way home, I started feeling extremely dizzy and had black spots appearing in my vision, I had to sit on the floor until it subsided; this happened twice more in the 500m walk to my house. It's been several hours since then, but I'm still getting dizzy spells while walking around in my house.
can be.  Sounds like a drop in blood pressure brought on either by the extraction itself, it is more traumatic than people realise and the body does go into a mild form of shock.  And/or you might have been given a sedative with the injection to make the extraction less physically/psychologically traumatic, which would also cause a drop in bp and your responses.\n\nIf you still feel the same in the morning, phone the dentist and ask him, if not, a visit to the docs to be on safe side, and good luck."

or, to start with, where does a supernoca come from? and where does it go
It depends on the mass of the star in question. For example, a star is born, it grows old, it gets larger (Red giant stage) and it dies. Depending on its mass and newly discovered turbulence inside a star before collapse, it will either go supernova and create a planetary nebula and reduce to a white dwarf, or go supernova, continue to collapse and turn into a black hole. It all depends on the mass of the star, and the amount and directionality of the turbulence inside the star's core."

Well, I was thinking about contact lenses but people were trying to convince me that they are not all that they are cracked up to be. What are they like, and how to they feel. Also do they had symotoms or side effects, and where can you get them for cheap?
I've worn hard contact lenses since Adam was a boy and with no problems at all. Contrary to what others may say, they are not difficult to put in (your eyes), it just takes a little practice. Of course proper hygiene is necessary (wash your hands before you put them in or take them out, clean them daily and store them in fresh solution). See an eye care specialist and don't buy cheap lenses."
"why do i have red hair and nobody else in my whole entire family tree doesn't?
ahhhhh it is weird and i'm chinese i didn't dye my hair
Because you're a lucky rockstar. Either you were adopted and they didn't tell you, it's a dormant gene, or there's something in your diet or environment that brings out natural red tones in your hair. Don't worry about it, I'll bet it's gorgeous!"
"did Adam and Eve have Belly Buttons?

Does God have a belly button?  Adam and Eve were created in His image.\n\nThe scriptures don't say whether Adam and Eve had a belly button.  You might argue that they won't have one, because they were created without mention of a father or mother.  But could the description given in the Bible be figurative?\n\nEven accepting the belief that they didn't have parents, why wouldn't God create them with belly buttons so that they would look like their children?  Not every part of us has to have an obvious physical reason for existence.  \n\nMy opinion?  Adam and Eve had belly buttons."
"what is APR (Annual Percentage Rate)? and how is it calculated?

APR is the annual percentage rate of the finance charge.  The lower the interest rate, the less money you pay in finance charges.  The two different APRs are known as fixed and variable.  A fixed APR is a set rate which the company charges you to use their money.  Some people prefer a fixed rate because they know how much money they are going to be charged each month in interest.  A variable rate changes depending on the economy and is usually calculated by adding the prime rate to the marginal rate.  Some people prefer the variable rate because when the economy is going well the prime rate is usually very low and you could end up paying a lower interest rate.  The down side is that when the economy is bad and the prime rate is high you will end up paying a higher interest rate."

"What is an albino?

Albinism (from Latin albus, meaning ""white"") is a lack of pigmentation (see discussion of pigmentaion next paragraph) in the eyes, skin and hair. It is an inherited condition resulting from the combination of recessive alleles passed from both parents of an individual. This condition is known to affect mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. While the most common term for an individual affected by albinism is ""albino"", most of them prefer ""person with albinism"", because ""albino"" is most often used in a derogatory way.\n\nRegarding Pigmentation:\n\nIn biology, pigment is any material resulting in colour in plant or animal cells which is the result of selective absorption. Some biological material has so-called structural colour, which is the result of selective reflection or iridescence, usually done with multilayer structures. Unlike structural colour, pigment color is the same for all viewing angles. Nearly all types of cells, such as skin, eyes, fur and hair contain pigment. Butterfly wings typically contain structural colour, although many of them contain pigment as well. Creatures that have deficient pigmentation are called albinos."

"what is the "" duhas - van alfan effect "" in solid state physics?
calculation of electronic band
The correct name is de Haas-van Alphen effect. Alphen is also spelled as Alfven.\n\nThese physicists,  de Haas and van Alphen, observed in 1930 that under special conditions (very low temperatures) the magnetization M caused in a sample by external magnetic field B did not change linearly with B. \n\nMore specifically, the ratio M/B was going up and down, being a periodical function of 1/B. This happens only in diamagnetic materials, not in para- or ferromagnetic ones.\n\nThe effect was explained theoretically by (Soviet physicist) Lev Landau, as a result of quantum effects in charged particle motion in magnetic field (so called Landau quantization).\n\nHere is the relevant quote from (very long) article [3]:\n\n\nThe de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect is an oscillatory variation of the diamagnetic susceptibility as a function of a magnetic field strength (B)... \n\nThe first experimental observation of this behavior was made by de Haas and van Alphen (1930). They have measured a magnetization M of semimetal bismuth (Bi) as a function of the magnetic field (B) in high fields at 14.2 K and found that the magnetic susceptibility M/B is a periodic function of the reciprocal of the magnetic field (1/B). \n\nThis phenomenon is observed only at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Similar oscillatory behavior has been also observed in magnetoresistance (so called the Shubnikov-de Haas effect).\n\nThe dHvA phenomenon was explained by Landau1 as a direct consequence of the quantization of closed electronic orbits in a magnetic field and thus as a direct observational manifestation of a purely quantum mechanics. The phenomenon became of even greater interest and importance when Onsager2 pointed out that the change in 1/B through a single period of oscillation was determined by the remarkably simple relation."

Volcanoes:\nThere are several processes in Plate Tectonics that cause volcanism, but they result in two main types of volcanism.\n\nVolcanism in subduction is caused by volitials, like H2O, CO2. These are carried down by the plate, mainly in the form of weak minerals. These minerals break down with pressure and temperature into stronger minerals that don't contain water and carbon dioxide. The leftover gases and liquids travel into the mantle (the mantle wedge) and hydrate the mantle, causing melting. The melt rises and then... volcano!\n\nThe other main cause is from rising mantle material, which forms decompression melting. Basically, hot mantle is kept from melting by the pressure of the earth at depth. When this material rises, the pressure drops much faster than the temperature, and thus it partially melts. This mainly occurs at divergent boundaries and hot spots, which are areas in plate tectonics that have rising materials or spreading.\n\nShield: Hawai'i (Kiluea, Mauna Loa), basalt, low viscosity\nCinder Cone: Stromboli, many in eastern California, low viscosity high gas\nComposite: Vesuvius, St. Helens, Fugi, medium viscosity, medium gas\n\nMagma erupts due to bouyancy (raises due to low density) and degasing, gas exolving from the liquid magma.\n\nHope that covers it all."

Yes you can do it. It will only take a few seconds, because you want to kill the germs and bacteria.

"Honestly,  why does it matter to you atheists or evolutionist if most believe in creation?
I can't help but think, why would anything matter since this is all there is, if you don't believe in God.  If we're ignorant who cares we'll be dead soon.  Improve things for whom?  For more people who will just die. \nThis time I'm not just being a jack***.
I'm not sure why you think that nothing matters if you don't believe in God.  Love of family matters, concern about the future of humanity and your descendents matters, everything matters- In fact, I would imagine that a belief in God would decrease, not increase, your concern for life and the future- According to the Bible, no matter what we do, it will all end in a huge battle, and all things humans do or have done will not matter at all.. It's a fairly hopeless viewpoint, thinking that there is no hope for ultimate salvation, that humans will not advance, that we will all be judged based on how well we worshipped a deity, and the human world is baseless, and all we know or do or try to accomplish means nothing.  Without a belief in God, there is hope for the future, hope that mankind can excel, improve, learn and grow and someday become more than we are today- That each thing we discover may be unknown in the Universe, that what we do really does matter to the future and has some real effect.\nWhether or not you believe in evolution doesn't emotionally upset me, any more than a person who doesn't believe the Earth rotates around the Sun.  I think a rejection of the massive amount of data and logic supporting the theory should at least be studied carefully, not merely rejected out of hand because it may threaten a belief system, but in the end, it likely has very little effect on the daily life of either you or your opponents.  There are good, kind, intelligent people that believe in evolution, and good, kind, intelligent people that don't...and vice-versa."

"help pleas???
how can i loose 20 pounds in a month???OR how can i loose weight??im trying to loose weight....wat can i do??
Losing 20 pounds in a month is not the healthy way to go. You shouldn't aim to lose more than 1 to 2 pounds a week, no matter what size you are. Extreme dieting not only compromises your health, but you're 75% more likely to gain the weight back after you've stopped than if you'd done it the healthy way. Which is.....\n\nEat more (but healthily) and exercise more! There is no magic pill or drink that sheds the pounds, contrary to popular belief.\n\nLittle changes in your lifestyle will help so much. Eat smaller portions, and eat slowly so you'll feel when you're full. Avoid snacking on unhealthy, fatty foods by posting a list of heart healthy foods on the fridge. Get involved in your cooking so you know exactly what's in it. Include fiber (found in fruits, veggies, and whole grains) in your diet; it'll fill you up faster and make you feel full longer. Low-fat dairy and whole grains have been shown (in addition to a healthy lifestyle) to make smaller waists. Make exchanges: instead of eating high-fat potato chips, eat a few fat-free Pringles. Instead of eating ice cream, eat low-fat frozen yogurt. And most importantly, excercise! 3 or 4 times a week, at least. Cardio is best for people expecting fast results. (running, swimming, biking, stairs, jump roping, etc.)\n\nJust be sure not to cut out any specific thing from your diet. A lot of people make the mistake of trying to cut out all fats, even the goods ones. Don't do it! It'll compromise your health and your diet.\n\nEat a healthy, balanced diet and exercise, and the weight will come off. Good luck!"

"Does the atkins diet work>?

Definitely.\n\nThe difficulties that most people have reported with it are due to a lack of undestanding of the diet. People focus more on a list of foods thay can or can't have and don't pay enough attention to the why of it.\n\nOn the atkins diet you can have potato chips and chocolate cake... the thing is that you have to understand how they affect your body, and how much you can have. Your body may tolerate these foods well, so you can have a lot, or your body may react strongly to these so that you can never have more than a little.\n\nA lot of people say you can only have protein on this diet... But this is really a CARBOHYDRATE restriction... on the most severe form of the diet, you are limited to 2 cups of vegetables, or 3 cups of salad greens a day. How many people get this many vegetables on their current diet? Almost none! What these people are really frustrated about is that if they stop eating bread and potato chips and rice and candy bars, they don't know what to eat. They don't WANT the vegetables. Add on that most people who need to diet are eating too many calories a day and you get a lot of frustrated people. The foods that are the ones with no limit are the proteins some people complain about getting to much of. If you don't want that much protein, eat less! With the vegetable guidelines and a reasonable portion of eggs, cheese and meat, it is easy to maintain the recommended 2000 calorie diet without eating an excessive amount of protein.\n\nAdditionally, many people have what could almost be considered an addiction to carbohydrates that convert to sugar quickly in the bloodstream, which creates a self control challenge some people can't handle. These are the people that always complain that they miss bread, and that this diet is so hard.\n\nThe thing people need to really understand in order to make the Atkins diet work, is that the induction diet is the most restricted part, but after you have started your weight loss, you gradually increase your carbohydrate intake until you reach a balance. Someone who lost 30 pounds and then gained it all back didn't follow the diet, if they had, when they started gaining weight they would have adjusted their carbohydrate intake to begin losing weight again.\n\nIf you change your diet habits and lose weight, then consider yourself ""fixed"" and start eating like you did before... you will gain weight back. That should be common sense. If you are overweight and want to lose weight you have to change your diet forever, not just until the weight is gone. This is true of EVERY diet, not just Atkins."
"Does oral sex count as sex?
I've tried oral sex, but I wanna know does it count as sex?
No, I don't think it is the same thing. Though very unlikely that you would only have an oral encounter and not sex. I think there must be penetration in order to be counted as actual sex referring to intercourse. Now there are sexual acts that includes oral and such but it would not be correct to say you had ""sex' with them. Virgins would not loose their virginity by fellatio or cunnilingus.\n\nThe key is the penetration being present or not to define actual sex."
"Why does a nerve cell don't divide?
What is the cause why nerve cells dont divide? or simply why does a nerve cell dont divide? pls help.
They have recently discovered that nerve tissue actually can divide and regenerate, but at a veeeery slow rate. The reason can be explained in terms of the cell cycle. Nerve cells are in a phase known as G0 this is known as a resting phase. Nerve cells were thought of as permanent tissues. The other types of tissues that you get are stable and labile. Muscle is another tissue that is permanent. Liver tissue is very interesting. it is usually permanet but when massive damage to the liver occurs, the cells can get out of g0 and undergo mitosis to repair the tissue!Hair cells and skin are types that are rapidly dividing and can regenrate the easiest!"

"Is it known if Mercury was ever volcanically active because of tidal forces caused by the Sun?
The tidal effects that Jupiter has on Io made me wonder if the Sun ever had the same effect on Mercury.  Now I understand that the distances are vastly different and there are great differences in the relationships of these bodies so it might be like comparing apples to oranges.  Any help is appreciated.
Like so many other things, the answer is yes and no. \n\nMercury is supposed to be, size for size, the densest of the planets. It must contain amazing amounts of metals. Because of its density, the solar tides will surely have some effect on it. Metals have properties like ductility and malleability, so that they are accustomed to deforming. I expect that the interior of Mercury will be kneaded by the tidal force of the Sun until it is comfortably molten.\n\nBut given that the surface of Mercury is so hot, it lacks one of the fearures Earth has, which allows for volcanoes-- if the pressure of molten material builds up under the surface on Mercury, it will simply ooze out through the (already softened) surface. There will be no eruption leading to a build-up of material in a cone shape.\n\nSo there could probably be lava/ molten metal flows, but not 'volcanoes'.\n\n6 NOV 06, 1840 hrs, GMT."

"Have you had a colposcopy examination?
I am having a colposcopy examination in two weeks. It is where the doctor examines the cervix with a microscope, it is a bit like getting a smear test or screening but they dab liquid on to the cervix to highlight any abmormal cells and if they are found then they are cut out! I will be awake during this...just wanted some reassurance about it. Have to have it done as my smear test results were unclear. Thanks
My smear test results were also unclear so I had to have one done also. Having a colpo exam is not bad. I am going to suggest you take a motrin before you go just incase you get some cramping. They use a duck bill just like in a pap, spread the liquid around your cervix and look at it with a microscope/blacklight to see any abnormal cells. My doctor had a machine that took pictures so that I could see what was going on too. They found some abnormal cells and took a biopsy. This is where you will feel some cramping probably. It feels like a pinch or a cramp. Nothing untolerable. (But the motrin helps!) After that they took a look inside the cervix, this part was the most uncomfortable. Not really painful, but not pleasant. After that it was over and we looked at the pictures and doctor explained to me what everything was. Just remember the motrin, my friend had to have a colpo also and she didn't take motrin and said hers was much more painful than mine sounded."
"Who Said this quote? Christians do you know?
My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... For as a Christian I have a responsibility to my people...Who said this?
Hitler said this.  However, by the way you ask the question, I inferred that you mean to attack christianity.  Hitler has no comparison to Christ."

During this time period I was undoubtedly miserable, but trust me, when you get out of this phase (and you will get out of it, don't worry) you'll end up a much happier and better person. And I'm not just speaking of my own experiances, I've had friends go through the same difficulties, it's among the hardest phases in life, but I think most, or a least a fraction of people undergo this. It's normal for poeple to go through a period of time in their lives where they just don't care about the same things others seem to live, or even die, for. However, soon, you'll find that you've left this lost, confused piece of you behind and your life gets better than it was before this. So no, you're not insane, because if you are, then that means so many more people are as well, and I'm not willing to make a reservation at the rubber room just yet."
"if had mumps as child does cause immunity to later outbreak?
had mumps in childhood age 7 before 1940 can this episode pass on life immunity, also had measles, chicken pox , all the childhood maladies.
It's not 100%, but close to it.  Mumps, like many other viral illnesses, can produce lifelong immunity if you have had it.  However, it's not 100%.\n\nIt is, however, better immunity than the mumps vaccine - which confers about 80% immunity after one dose and a little over 90% after two.\n\nMost everyone should have had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.  Especially if you live in areas where there are currently outbreaks!"

"Wavelength and Frequency Problems?
1.Light with a frequency of 7.36x10^14 Hz lies in the violet region of the visible spectrum. What is the wavelength of this frequency of light? Answer in units of nm.\n2.When an electron beam strikes a block of copper, x-rays of frequency 1.09x10^19 Hz are emitted. What is the wavelength of these x-rays? Answer in units of nm.\n\nIf someone could help me with these it would be greatly appreciated. I have no clue how.
ok, you have the frequency and what you want is hte wavelength. You need this equation. The wavelength multipled by the frequency gives you the speed of light. (2.9979x10^8) \n\nThis will give you the answer and if you want to convert from m to nm, you have to know that the relationship is 10^9. There are 10^9 nm in one meter."
"Qualifications in a cafe?

"I got a question based on how waves are formed?
Me and my friend had an arguement, where my friend says that the waves are formed only by the gravitational effect, and not by wind, and my counter explanation was that wind causes waves, and also agree upon his point that gravtitation causes tides. So i want to clearly know whether both are the causes for waves or just the wind??
The waves are usually formed by wind action, but can be formed by earthquakes or volcanic explosions (tsunamis). The tides are a result of gravitational effects of the moon and sun."

I did some research and i think the place you're thinking of is in fact Myanmar (Burma) and what you refer to as 'pink jade' is actually jadeitite or jadeite. The place were it is world renowned is called Kyaukseinmyo in the Hpakan region or perhaps the Kachin region i'm not too sure which is in northern Burma.

"How can I increase my FICO score quickly?
I have really poor credit and a 518 credit score.  I need to raise it quickly.
First of all, how old are the tradelines (reported items) on your credit report? If they are old enough, say 5-6 years old or more, you may be able to dispute them. However, you must be aware that you do not want to initially dispute with the credit reporting agencies, but with the creditors themselves. It is called a ""Request for Validation."" Persuant to the Fair Debt Collections Act, 15 USC 1692g Sect. 809 (b), the debt collector must provide you with evidence that the debt belongs to you. If they CANNOT provide you with sufficent written proof, then persuant to Fair Debt Collections Act, they must stop all collection activity, and delete the tradeline from your credit report. BE AWARE: not all collectors are willing to cooperate. They may report a current delinquincy on your credit report while you fight the debt, and may begin the collection attempts all over again. Also keep in mind that it is very feasible that the creditors may validate the debt(s), re-report to the credit bureaus, and your score may go down. \n     Please note that there is no such thing as a quick fix. Fixing your credit takes time, energy, and a whole lot of patience. Don't fall prey to any company that claims to fix your credit overnight, especially when they are charging a ridiculous amount of money.  Even if it is possible, the next scoring cycle may put you right back to where you started. Credit repair can be done on your own for free. If you are interested, I have completed a massive amount of research, and I have a collection of interactive PDF forms that you can complete and mail off to the collectors as well as the credit reporting agencies. \n     If a creditor validates a debt, then you need to work with them on a settlement. DO NOT send them a payment without a written agreement of the terms. Collectors are tricky, and want to collect as much from you as they can. In other words, get everything in writing. Again, I have settlement forms in PDF format should you be interested.\n     All of these techniques have worked for me, as I have increase my score over 120 points in the past 14 months. At a 518 FICO score, you really don't have much to lose..."
"what are some good excercises to tone the upper body without using weights?

push ups (all the different ways to do them), crunches, sit ups, tri-cep dips, the plank for abs, bycicle crunches, leg lifts, leg pop ups, ab throws, chin ups..\n\nfor the leg lifts/leg pop ups you lay on your back with your hands underneath your loweback and you use your abs to lift your legs up to a 90 degree angle and then you slowly lower them back down and then repeat. don't let your legs hit the floor in between. it really squeezes your abs. do as many reps are you can.\n\nrunning really helps to burn fat off your bodyso that your muscles are not covered."

There is now an increase in sin than the LOVEof GOD.\nIn our music,dresing,speach etc.promotes the devils kingdom which must not be so.\nEven thow the BIBLE has said ""in the last day's sin will increase and the LOVE OF GOD will wax cold""....it must not be so.\nI believe the TRUE CHRISTIANS can win and secure more souls in HEAVEN.
JESUS does all of the securing...Christians merely plant the seed...He gives the increase as He sees fit."
"Will the Iraqi Dinar be value more in one, five or ten years?

The Iraqi Dinar is definitely a long term investment. It probably won't increase in value until the war in Iraq is over and the economy has rebuilt itself. So even if the war ends 3 years from now, Iraq won't rebuild itself less then 5 years later. I'd say you may see a value increase in 5 years, but nothing significant until 10 years have elapsed. Hope this helps."
"Why do some men like wearing women's panties?
I have been wearing panties on and off since high school. I have tried sexy mens underwear but it just isn't as exilerating as women panties. My wife does not understand it and barely puts up with it. I am in my 40's now and am at the point where I almost don't care why, I just do it cause it feels good.  I would appreciate any thoughts from other men, why you like to wear women's panties.
I've been wearing them on and off since I was 15. I've found them to be extremly comfortable, feel great and make me feel sexy and at the same time wonder if anyone knows the secret I'm wearing! I've been married for just over a year and my wife is cool with it. I don't wear them all the time. Just once in awhile and sometimes she'll ask me to wear a pair....usually if we're going out and gonna have ""fun"" Good luck!"
"regarding creation........?
is the 7 days of creation a reference to 7 of our days or 7 of God's days.
Seven of God's days. He dwells in eternity where it is timeless. Remember that the sun, moon and stars were not created until the fourth day. So what was the source of light on day one? What was the division of light and darkness? Remember the Tabernacle in the wilderness? This was not a new design, it was a model of heaven. God created the earth as modeled in heaven with a division of light and darkness. This may be areas in the eternal relm where God dwells and possible where Satan dwells. According to Revelation, this heaven will pass away and a new heaven and new earth will be created with NO night. So what happens to the dark eternity? It becomes what is called ""outer darkness"".\nBeing here on earth, it is hard to interpret the concept of eternity. Einstein got close when he proved that time is a physical property.\nThis was a great question. Thanks!"
"Nuts are good cholesterol . What  about   peanuts? Do all kind of nuts contain  good cholesterol?

Nuts do not contain any cholesterol, you only get cholesterol from animal or seafood sources. Nuts do contain unsaturated fatty acids which are good for you. The best nuts are unroasted ones, they also contain vitamin E which is lost in the roasting process."
"What is it mean if you get a small bag of blood forming in the inside of your mouth?
There are two small blood bags, a half the size of rice kernel each, inside the mouth.  They're on the inside of a cheek.  They show up 2 or 3 times a year and bleed if popped.  My guess is that my teeth grinding habit caused sharp teeth to become too abrasive.  And it causing the present condition.  Or the dentist's x-ray causing some sort of skin problem.  Any ideas?
It could be a scab.  I get those once every few years.  Best thing to do is to see or talk to a dentist."

"My crown tooth hurts...?
I got crowns for 4 of my teeth after root canals about a year ago.  One tooth was particularly temp sensitive just after i had the crown put on.  Now...one year later that same tooth is bugging me again.  If I eat or drink something really hot or cold I'll get a stinging pain in that tooth region.  Anyone have any clues?  Will it just go away like it did the first time?  Just moved overseas and don't have medical coverage yet so I'm hoping this doesn't require a visit to the dentist.
Unfortunately, you need to have an exam by a dentist. Sensitivity and pain to hot and cold with a (stinging) pain, is a dead give away that something is very wrong with your tooth. Sometimes  teeth have hidden or extra canals that need treated. Sometimes the RCT fails, or needs to be retreated. Sometimes the margins of a crown are not closed properly, and you will have sensitivity and pain. There are many reasons. The fact is, you won't find the answer without a dental radiograph, and exam."

"how can I know for sure whether I am pregnant  BEFORE my period? if it is possible at all...?
it is so nerve-taking to wait for 2 more weeks!!!! :)
Yes it is possible, but not practical for most women. hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) can be measured in blood 7-10 days post conception, which would be before your period started, probably. It is probably best just to wait and buy a pregnancy test, (which detects hCG in urine) which you do after your period should have arrived."
"In the stream of thought though Koran started with Old Testament and compromised with the New Testament, Yet?
Yet it failed to unify the semitic religions. Is it because, all of them concentrated on the Mythology of Adam/Eve, Abraham, Moses, Jacob, Jesus and at last Muhammad on himself? The conflict continues unresolved till present.
Semitic religions have a common source and they have been fighting for acceptability of Jesus and Muhammad in the order of Prophets. Muhammad tried to unify all these three and in the name of 'Peace' unify the mankind by removing all distinction in the social structure. But ironically, he adopted more brutal force against the Jews and his followers against the Christians for conversion. It has wrought more violence and mass killing and widened the gaping chasm between the Muslims and the non-Muslims among the followers of the Semitic religions."

"Do I have to eat by the food pyramid?
When I went to the doctor they told me to eat by the pyramid, but I talked to some people and they say eat what you want it won't hurt the baby, just as long as you eat enough of what you're eating. Which do I believe?
Your body needs THREE things in bulk... ideally:  Proteins (the most important), Carbohydrates and Lipids... \n\nThat will generally mean lots of meat... bread (or rice, or potatoes, or pasta) .... and dairy products. \n\nOther things... vitamins and minerals as they say.... are only needed in tiny amounts. Then again they're only present in many foods in tiny amounts. You can get by with vitamin supplements instead, but thats generally not too healthy. You can however be far more variable in how much fruit and veg you eat..... Its not as important to deliberately eat in bulk.\n\nThe protein is the most important though. The carbs and lipids are just an energy source and occasionally a source of extra hydrocarbon molecules for the framework of other molecules.... The proteins however are what the entire operational system of the body is based on.... not least all the enzymes that keep things running, the functional structures of each and every cell in your body.... and... well.... I'm sure you get the point. \n\nAnd for the record.... you have to eat less animal protein than you would plant protein to get the same amount of nutrition from it.... just in case you consider the vegitarian option. Plants need different amino acids to us animals... thus you'll get a lot you don't need from them which are effectively superfluous....  There is no equivalent substitute for red meat... \n\nAnd ironic as it is for someone as nocturnally inclined as myself to suggest this..... but get as much sunlight as you can within reason. The extra vitamin D will really help... and its utilised via sunlight through the skin (its our own answer to photosynthesis, I guess)."

"What is a mentifact??

Mentifacts are the ideas, values and beliefs of a culture. Religion has shaped culture more than any other trait in the history of the world. The ancient Aztecs sacrificed hundreds of thousands of people for their religion. Sunday is considered a day of rest in most Christian cultures. Language is also an important mentifact. Languages adapt to suit a particular culture. Eskimos lives are dominated by living primarily in the snow and ice. Their language has over fifty words to describe different types of snow. We would be at a loss to describe all of the types of snow in the English language since snow isn't an important part of our culture."

It can be clearly seen flapping, yet there's no atmosphere on the moon.\n\nNow I believe that NASA DID land on the moon, but, how can the flapping flag be explained?
The flag is not flapping in the wind.  It is moving becuase of the momentum imparted by opening the flagpole, stretching out the flag itself, and then the drilling motion used to put the flagpole in the ground.\n\nThe flag keeps on moving because there's no atmosphere to STOP it.\n\ngo see www.badastronomy.com for more truth"

You work you got to pay about £30 tax, about £6 nat ins, you got to pay about £60 rent, and then there is travelling expenses to get to work about £15, and you eat more because you work, and often can`t buy from the cheapest places because you work, not to mention the fact you lose your ""jobseekers allowence"" which is about £60 a week. So add all these things together, you get about £180 or so. So your first £180 a week you earn, is just to get back to the place where you was when you didn`t work. So a 40 hour a week job that pays say £210 a week, you would be £30 a week better off. So you are actualy getting paid about 75p an hour. I don`t know about you, but I believe that my time is worth much more than 75p an hour. There is so many better things I could be doing with my time if I wern`t working. Is this a common opinion, that work these days just don`t pay?
If you enjoy what you are doing,then there is no problem doing it.So for those everything becomes habit/routine.\n\nIt is already a choice in everyones life.If you want better life,work otherwise ....\n\n\nPlease send a blank mail to pradeepmv@isendinfo.net.\nThanks\nPradeep M  V"
"Is it a Sin?
i got a $200 rebate check for a laptop that i sold later. Item was sold used. Is it a Sin to cash it?
Rebates have no rules about this. You can cash the check. The only problem would be is if the person you sold it to wants a rebate... then they would not be able to get one since the Serial Number has already had a rebate associated with it.\n\nI worked in a rebate center and we had these questions all the time. Go ahead and cash it."
"Force between a point charge and a wire?
If two points have charge Q1 and Q2 respectively, then the force between them:\nF = k[Q1][Q2]/(r^2) where r is the distance between them.\n\nNow I have a wire (infinite length) of charge W Coulombs per m, and a point with charge Q a distance r away from the wire.  Leaving the constant term as k, what is the force between the wire and the point.\n\ni think the answer is 2kQW/r but im not sure, it will involve integrating force (a vector) and I don't know if this affects the results.\n\nAny help?

"So, what is your interpretation of Song of Songs in the Bible?

Romantic poetry. The nature imagery is a polite way of referring to a newly wedded couple just before, during, and not long after their wedding day. Throughout the history of the church it has been interpreted differently because of the impact of Greek dualism (that all matter is evil, therefore anything romantic that enjoys physical pleasure would be evil)."
"whats the density of the atmospehere?

The density of air, ρ (Greek: rho) (air density), is the mass per unit volume of Earth's atmosphere, and is a useful value in aeronautics. In the SI system it is measured as the number of kilograms of air in a cubic meter (kg/m3). At sea level and at 20 °C dry air has a density of approximately 1.2 kg/m3. varying with pressure and temperature. Air density and air pressure decrease with increasing altitude.\n\nThe formula for the density of air is given by:\n\n P=p/R*T\nwhere ρ is the air density, p is pressure, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nThe individual gas constant R for dry air is:\n\n R( dry air )=287.05J/kg*K\nTherefore:\n\nAt standard temperature and pressure (0 °C and 101.325 kPa), dry air has a density of ρSTP = 1.293 kg/m3. \nAt standard ambient temperature and pressure (25 °C and 100 kPa) dry air has a density of ρSATP = 1.168 kg/m3. \n[edit]\nEffect of water vapor\nFor moist air, the partial pressure of the water vapor must be considered as well. In this case, the density of the air is the sum of the density of the dry air and the density of the water vapor:\nP=pdry air /Rdry air*T+p water vapour/R water vapour*T\n \nThe gas constant for water vapor is:\nR water vapour=461.495 J/kg*K\n \nEffects of altitude\nTo calculate the density of air as a function of altitude, one requires additional parameters. They are listed below, along with their values according to the International Standard Atmosphere, using the universal gas constant instead of the specific one:\n\nsea level atmospheric pressure p0 = 101325 Pa = 1013.25 mbar or hPa = 101.325 kPa (= 101325 kg/(m*s2)) \nsea level standard temperature T0 = 288.15 K \nEarth-surface gravitational acceleration g = 9.80665 m/s2. \ndry adiabatic lapse rate L = −0.0065 K/m \nuniversal gas constant R = 8.31447 J/(mol·K) \nmolecular weight of dry air M = 0.0289644 kg/mol \nTemperature at altitude h metres above sea level is given by the following formula (only valid below the tropopause):\n\n T=To+L*H\nImportance of temperature\nThe below table demonstrates that the properties of air change significantly with temperature.\n\nTable — speed of sound in air c, density of air ρ, acoustic impedance Z vs. temperature °C\n\nImpact of temperature \n°C c in m/s ρ in kg/m³ Z in Pa·s/m \n- 10 325.4 1.341 436.5 \n- 5 328.5 1.316 432.4 \n0 331.5 1.293 428.3 \n+ 5 334.5 1.269 424.5 \n+ 10 337.5 1.247 420.7 \n+ 15 340.5 1.225 417.0 \n+ 20 343.4 1.204 413.5 \n+ 25 346.3 1.184 410.0 \n+ 30 349.2 1.164 406.6"

"what can help tinnius?

First of all.. Tinnitus. Tinnitus as a ringing, hissing or other sensation of noise in the ears. It may not be associated with hearing impairment. Tinnitus is not an audiological phenomenon, it is a medical condition that produces auditory sensation of tones and noises. This is why tinnitus can occur in a so-called dead ear. There is no known cure for tinnitus, except for a very few cases of disease symptoms or pathological conditions that can be medically corrected. \n\nIt is important to first.. determine the cause..After a detailed analysis of the problem and after exploring several possible solutions, in certain cases, it is possible to eliminate tinnitus or else to lessen its unpleasant effects.\n\nSome of those ways is as follows:\n\n*Medication and other medical treatment can provide relief from tinnitus for varying periods of time. Vasodilators, anti-convulsants and barbiturates can alleviate tinnitus for a limited time. However, operations to cut nerve fibers have been found to have little effect and entail numerous side-effects which should be discussed with your doctor. \n*Certain treatments intended to eliminate tinnitus (such as medication, operations, electrical stimulation, etc.) have in some cases increased the intensity and frequency of tinnitus. \n*The effectiveness of so-called alternative medicine (such as chiropractic, osteopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture, etc.) has only been studied in a few cases. The results show these methods improve a person's general well-being. \n*Using different techniques (such as soft music, radio or television interference, or special masking devices) TO MASK tinnitus has been successful in some cases. THe masking noise, because it comes from outside and because the individual can control it, is often easier to tolerate than the noise in the ears. In some cases (and due to psychological factors not yet fully understood), masking techniques may even inhibit tinnitus, leading to its partial or total disappearance. However, masking devices are not suitable for everyone, and you should consult a qualified audiologist before using one. When there is hearing loss, tinnitus is sometimes masked when the person is wearing a hearing aid (which amplifies external sounds). \nTreatments of tinnitus which involve changes in behaviour entail becoming aware of how one reacts to tinnitus, or of how one's lifestyle encourages it. Certain methods of relaxtion allow a person to better control both the stress caused by tinnitus and the stress which causes tinnitus."

"Catholics - Where in the Bible does it say anything about pergatory?  Worshipping Mary?
When Jesus is dying on the cross, he tells one of the robbers that TODAY he will be with him in paradise.  Where does it say anything about pergatory?  Our prayers for the dead will not help them...God will judge their lives and he will choose whether they go to heaven or hell.  \n\nMary is a great woman,  but there is nothing in the Bible about praying to her or worshipping her.  Jesus is the only way to God.

THE ENTIRE TIME I WENT TO SCHOOL AND YEARS BEFORE THAT ,EVERY MAY, WE HAD WHAT WAS CALLED"" THE MAY CROWNING""  EVERY CLASS FROM FIRST THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE HAD THEIR OWN SPECIAL SONG THAT THEY SANG TO MARY ABOUT HER, THEN WHEN ALL THE CLASSES WERE IN THEIR PLACE IN CHURCH, BOYS WOULD CARRY A STATUE OF MARY SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS, ON SOME KIND OF PLATFORM, TO THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH, THEN A GIRL FROM THE EIGTH GRADE WOULD GO UP TO HER AND PLACE A CROWN UPON HER HEAD. THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE SONGS OF WORSHIP. IF THIS IS NOT WORSHIP, THEN WHAT IS IT?\nIT IS WRONG! THERE IS NO PLACE IN SCRIPTURE THAT SUPPORTS PURGATORY EITHER."
"A question just for you Mainworry. And others?
God is a jealous God. What God has an inferiority complex?\nSounds like he's not so...perfect.
With your point comes an important one.  First, the OT implies many gods ""I am A vain and jealous god (implying there must be more).  Worship no other gods BEFORE me (implying its ok to worship after him).\nAlso, to think of a being as powerful and omnipitent as God looks like us, thinks like us, and has human emotions JUST LIKE US is rediculous.  I think that's just humans putting a face on God to better relate."
"How is this possible?
tell me if im wrong but ive heard that outer space is infinite. however, people also say that the universe is expanding... so\n** How can the universe be expanding if it is already infinite? And WHERE is it expanding? **
Universe theories talk about a finite and unlimited Universe. The Universe is unlimited because it has no boundaries. There is no edge, no end where a spaceship would have to stop. See it as a tiny bug walking on the surface of a big balloon. The ballon has a finite dimension, but the bug will never find the end, so it is unlimited from the bug's point of view.\nSo, the Universe can be expanding or contracting or staying the same size. This is a very important question to answer in modern astronomy. Latest studies say that it is expanding, but it has not been totally proved.\nAnd where it is expanding? The Universe is creating more space and time where there is nothing."
"Why is the numbers 777 and 1.618 so important in todays life?

The number 1.618 is the divine proportion.\n\nThe Divine Proportion was closely studied by the Greek sculptor, Phidias, and as a result, it took on the name of Phi. Also referred to as the Golden Mean, the Magic Ratio, the Fibonacci Series, etc., Phi can be found throughout the universe; from the spirals of galaxies to the spiral of a Nautilus seashell; from the harmony of music to the beauty in art. A botanist will find it in the growth patterns of flowers and plants, while the zoologist sees it in the breeding of rabbits. The entomologist views it in the genealogy of a bee, and the physicist observes it in the behavior of light and atoms. A Wall Street analyst finds it in the rising and falling patterns of a market, the mathematician in the examination of the pentagram.\n\n \nThroughout history, Phi has been observed to evoke emotion or aesthetic feelings within us. The ancient Egyptians used it in the construction of the great pyramids and in the design of hieroglyphs found on tomb walls. At another time, thousands of miles away, the ancients of Mexico embraced Phi while building the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacan. The Greeks studied Phi closely through their mathematics and used it in their architecture. The Parthenon at Athens is a classic example of the use of the Golden Rectangle. Plato in his Timaeus considered it the most binding of all mathematical relations and makes it the key to the physics of the cosmos.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, Phi served as the ""hermetic"" structure on which great masterpieces were composed. Renowned artists such as Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci made use of it for they knew of its appealing qualities. Evidence suggests that classical music composed by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach embraces Phi. Whether it was by design or intuitive is not known.\n\n \nPhi must be considered in its relation to the human psyche since it is the psyche that interprets this phenomena. Although Phi appears to be fixed in nature, it actually is not. The only reason it seems fixed is because it is fixed within our own minds. This proportion corresponds to the mental vibrations that are within us and dictate our sense of pleasure and pain, beauty and ugliness, love and hate, etc. The result is we are held captive by these memories fixed by both body and mind. For if we were to view nature from an altered state of consciousness, the proportion would also be altered.\n\nTherefore, the Divine Proportion presents itself in the very physical nature of Creation. It is seen as the beauty and organization within the cosmos. It is the harmony and glue that holds the unity of the universe."

I was in an abusive marriage for 32 stupid years. I was taught that you stick it out no matter what. So I did. I wasted my whole life. The only thing I did get out  of the marriage was 2 wonderful children. They never knew what was going on. My husband rarely abused me when they were around.\n\nBut by the time the kids were in there teens, they would ask why I was taking the verbal and mental abuse they heard. Then I got tired of apologizing for his attitude all the time to others.\n\nI watched every thing that I could on abuse and self improvement, on T.V.\n\nWhen my dad, (who was like my husband) passed away, I saw my mom actually be happy.

"Why is it people misuse ""Echad"" and ""Elohiem"" to prove a tinity exists?
Elohim has plural morphological form in Hebrew, but it is used with singular verbs and adjectives in the Hebrew text when the particular meaning of the God of Israel (a singular deity) is traditionally understood. Thus the very first words of the Bible are breshit bara Elohim, where bara ברא is a verb inflected as third person singular masculine perfect. If Elohim were an ordinary plural word, then the plural verb form bar'u בראו would have been used in this sentence instead. Such plural grammatical forms are in fact found in cases where Elohim has semantically plural reference (not referring to the God of Israel).\n\nEchad in Hebrew — one — functions very much like the English word “one.” It is the numeral one. When you count in Hebrew, you begin “echad (one)…” Often it actually translates the indefinite article in English. You can have “a large statue.” The Hebrew word corresponding to “a” is echad, one.

"did jesus have a son or daughter?

Does the Bible ever mention any offspring of Jesus'?  You'd think that if the writers of the Bible were going to mention such detail as the lineage of all of the major kings, they'd mention something that important.  My guess would be no, he didn't have kids, and no, he wasn't gay, and no, he didn't marry Mary Magdalene, and no to all the other ridiculous rumors people make up because they just don't want to believe the truth.  Funny how people will believe a lie any day over the truth."

He doesn't drink anymore, so I can't get him anything that has to do with that.  It has to be something that will NOT cause my husband to get jealous.  Also, should I get something for his 4 year old son as well?  We won't be living together at Christmas, I don't think.  So I'm not sure if I should get something for his son or not THIS year, or wait till next.

"As a Catholic, how will you describe ""God"" to an atheist?
May the best answer win!
A University professor at a well known institution of higher learning challenged his students with this question.       ""Did God create everything that exists?""\n\nA student bravely replied, ""Yes he did!""\n\n""God created everything?"" The professor asked.\n\n""Yes sir, he certainly did,"" the student replied.\n\nThe professor answered,  ""If God created everything; then God created evil.    And, since evil exists, & according to the principle that our works define who we are, then we can assume God is evil.""\n\nThe student became quiet & did not respond to the professor's hypothetical definition.   The professor, quite pleased with himself, boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the religious faith was a myth.\n\nAnother student raised his hand & said,  ""May I ask you a question, professor?""\n\n""Of course,"" replied the professor.\n\nThe student stood up and asked, ""Professor, does cold exist?""\n\n""What kind of question is this?  Of course it exists.  Have you never been cold?""\n\nThe other students snickered at the young man's question.   The young man replied, ""In fact sir, cold does not exist.  According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat.\nEverybody or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, & heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy.   Absolute zero (-460F) is the total absence of heat; & all matter becomes inert &  incapable of reaction at that temperature.  Cold does not exist.  We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.""\n\nThe student continued, ""Professor, does darkness exist?""\n\nThe professor responded, ""Of course it does.""\n\nThe student replied , ""Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either.   Darkness is in reality the absence of light.   Light we can study, but not darkness.   In fact, we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors & study the various wave lengths of each color.   You cannot measure darkness.   A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness & illuminate it.   How can you know how dark a certain space is? \nYou measure the amount of light present.   Isn't this correct? \nDarkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.""\n\nFinally the young man asked the professor,  ""Sir, does evil exist?""\n\nNow uncertain, the professor responded,  ""Of course, as I have already said.   We see it\neveryday.   It is in the daily examples of man's inhumanity to man.   It is in the multitude of crime & violence everywhere in the world.   These manifestations are nothing else but evil.\n\nTo this the student replied,  ""Evil does not exist, sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself.  Evil is simply the absence of God.    It is just like darkness & cold,  a word that man has created to describe the absence of God.\nGod did not create evil.  Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart.    It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat, or the darkness\nthat comes when there is no light.""\n\nThe professor sat down."
"I want a career that involves animals, thing is i dont know what. Could u please help?
I love to travel and explore. I would go anywhere in the world. Some times i think about doing something like Jeff Corwin. I know he is a wildlife biologist but if i do do something like that then i would like to have my own tv show, like him. So i could show the world.....not only on books and newspaper. I've thought about being a vet, wildlife biologist, zoologist (but dont want to work in a zoo)...etc....I want something adventurous and fun....not to be stuck in a lab or something. I dont mind studying...especially when it comes to animals. Could you please help me? Im sooo clue less of what to do. Could you please tell me whats the most fun, exploring, adventurous animal job you can think of and why? That would help tons...Thanks! :)
I really recommend you take some time to find out what majors are out there and what they mean.  Zoology *is not* working in a zoo or the study of zoos.  It's the study of animal life and if you want to work with animals, that and biology should be your majors. \n\nAlso, don't forget about Primatology.  It's a subdiscipline of Physical Anthropology, but once you get to your masters level, it's biology and field research laden.   Primatologists working for preserves in Indonesia and Africa frequently work to rehabilitate the orphaned primates.  They also work to educate the world about primates and the dangers they face.  \n\nWhat you do with your major is up to you.  Once you have it decided and are in school, you can start doing unpaid internships with various organizations around the world.  You can try and find a good fit for what suits you and what doesn't.  Realize that a Masters or a Doctorate will most likely be required if you wish to pursue a field professionally.  \n\nAlso realize that unless you are in a preserve/reserve/zoo situation, your work will most likely be reserach oriented.  You will be in the field, but not just sitting and playing with the animals.  You will most likely have no contact with animals and will instead be watching for whatever your research assignment is.  Once your field assignment is over, you will have to organize your data and present it in a coherent format (scientific paper).  \n\n\nAnd remember, a biologist/zoologist that wants to travel has to be free to do so.  No ties.  That means no menagerie of pets at home to abandon.  No boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse that's not going to understand.  You can sustain relationships, but until you are ready to no longer travel, they will be long distance for large chunks of time. . .\n\nYou don't say how old you are, but you should start volunteering with animal organizations RIGHT NOW to get a feel for it.  Rescue groups, shelters, zoos, etc - it may not be what you wish to pursue, but the experience will help when you are applying for internships or doing study programs on site.  Also start looking for programs that do educational things like go into schools and talk to kids or give lectures at the zoo.  This will help teach you different approaches to talking to people about wildlife.  \n\nIf you want to be on camera educating the world, you should also take some acting/public speaking classes.  You need to be comfortable on camera and speaking to groups of people.  \n\nGood luck to you!"

"Two horizontal plates are 1cm apart. A sphere of mass 2.2*10da-13kg remains stationary when the potential?
difference between the plates is 350V with the upper plate negative.\na)Is the sphere positive or negatively charged. Explain\nb)calculate the magnitude of charge on the sphere.\nc)how much excess or deficit of electrons does the sphere have?\n\nPLEASE HELP!!!!
This is an easy one to answer.  Neglecting the effects of gravity, that is.  (a)  Neither.  The sphere would be accelerated to one or the other placte if it carried a charge.  (b)  Given (a), 0 C.  (c)  No deficit or surplus.\n\nNow, if the sphere is under the influence of [Earth's] gravity, then since the upper plate has a negative charge, then the lower might have a relative positive (relative to the upper plate's negative) charge.  \n(a) This means that the sphere, in order to be balanced in gravity, must have a net positive charge, or at least that it must have more negative charge than the lower plate and less negative charge than the upper plate.\n(b) Well, Let us assume that the plates are infinite plates.  That would mean that  the magnitude of the electric field strength between the two is V/d, where V is the potential difference and d the separation.  Therefore, E - 350v/1cm = 35000 V/m, or 35000 N/C.  Since the force due to gravity balances the force due to Coulomb on the Sphere (which is qE), qE = mg, and q, the charge on the sphere, is mg/E, or 6.16 * 10^-17 C.\n(c)  Since an electron carries a charge of 6.02 * 10^-19 C, this would mean that we have about 102 deficit electrons on the sphere."

They say you are supposed to act really nice back to them so they feel embarrased like that old saying ""you get more bees with honey"", blah, blah, blah. I say it doesn't work. I feel like when you do that it reaffirms their behavior like they are saying to themselves 'well, I straightened them out'. Sometimes if I'm in the right mood and feel like it say something mean back to them.
Depends on the situation and what they say. I will take so much and then use a very quick response of the palm to the chin. When they look up from the ground, I tell them; ""You as about as stupid as they come, you have no respect for me!!! I have no respect for you!!! Would you like to see more of my Disrespect or shut your Fu*king mouth and leave me alone. I have done NOTHING to you""!!!!!\nUsually, they seem to stay quite as people giggle. I call it; Acting in self defense! Usually when a person realize you will knock the crap out of them they WILL leave you alone. But, most of society now believes Verbal Abuse is OK."

I asked this question regarding Gnosticism... Why did the error(God) nail jesus to a tree. According to serveral Gnostic documents the errored nailed jesus to the cross. I wanted to know why this question got removed. Was it because it wasn't a Christian based question! Not everyone is a Christian!
They need one forum for Christians only and one for atheists/agnostics."

"Do you think I will get a good grade on my Ancient China project?
It's supposed to be pizza shaped.I have to write 1 paragraph on each slice(there are 4 slices).I also have to make a collage on the back of the paper.I can decorate it like a pizza and I can bring my project in a pizza box.
Is the pizza shaped idea a requirement?  Well if it was given by your professor then you don't have a choice right.  But if this is just your idea, I think that the Pizza idea does not match the Ancient China idea.  Maybe, you can choose a shape or object that has an ancient china theme."
"Dilution of English identity?
Can the English identity survive an influx of c 200,000 people - the population of Cambridge - of different culture and religions every year, given that many Englishmen/women leave the country at the same time? What are the ramifications for England?
What is the English identity? Is it the same as it was a generation ago? A century ago? Surely a nation's character is in a continual state of flux and evolution? I don't think there is anything to worry about, this is business as usual for a healthy country."

"Why  did man find it necessary to create ""God""?
I think it's $$$, don't you?
Men created gods and goddesses to explain the things he couldn't understand. As men evolved and learn ways to understand what was going on around him, the need lessened for deities. But even after all of these years, most of us still haven't let go those beliefs in things greater than ourselves. It's in our nature. Call it faith if you will. It may be right, or it may be wrong, but it is still what we personally choose to believe in."

Smart materials are a class of materials such as piezoceramics, shape memory materials etc. which have the capacity to produce a specific response to a stimuli. The examples can be a specific displacment for an applied force, a specific change in shape to a change in temperature and in the case of shape memory alloys the ability of a material to remember the original shape and recover that shape with change of temperature."
"I wanna become a mason,where do I go and who do I see?

I belonged to a church once, and the Pastor committed Adulty with his neighbor. Not that I cared because I know humans are not perfect, just forgiven.\n\nAs for Masonry, you have to Ask one to be one, which means ask a mason in your community for a petition. Fill it out and return it to him with a check, or money order for the amount that that lodge requires...which is usually your first years dues, and your initiation fee. Mine was only $100 which isn't bad some are even cheaper depending on the size of the lodge.\n\nthey will then read your petition and let it lay for 1 month then vote on it. Usually during this one month period a couple of them will contact you and come to visit you and your family to talk with you and answer some questions you, or  your spouse, may have. Also in most states you must be 21 years old, but some are even 18 years of age now. \n\nThe easiest way to find out more about a Lodge in your area (if in the US) is by visiting http://www.wvmasons.org and look under U.S. Grand Lodges then look up your state.\n\nGood luck to you and keep in touch :)"
"What is your take on all the psychic readings Prince William gets on his future wife?
I've recently frequented www.theinternetforum.net/royalforum and there are people on there that have posted 2 or 3 different psychic readings they found on Prince William's future wife, and we even have a thread on there (at least 5 pages long). And there's even a girl on there who claims that William and Kate are almost over (which I have read a recent article on William cheating on her) and that William will meet a blond girl soon from his past and basically insinuating she is the future wife. I don't mean to blow anyone's cover, or say that they are impossible or false. But do you really think anybody knows William's future wife?\n\nIf you ask me, I do feel Kate and William may break up soon or in the next two years and that she isn't the one, but it's possible that William has not meet the one. I'm not psychic but I do get gut feelings.
I actualy get readings myself and found one girl on the net that I have gone to for a number of years that is amazingly acurate for me. So I would have to say that I find some to be accurate and some to be not. \nIf anyone wants to try out the girl I go to you wont be dissapointed.\nhere is the link. \nhttp://weRlive.com/vippath.asp?hnumber=284092\nShe has great feedback that backs up my claims dont take me on my word. and she has been reading on the top sites on the net for years.\nbut as for Prince william only time will tell how true his predictions are, I can only speak for mine."

"What is typhoid fevers scientific name?

Typhoid fever (a.k.a. Enteric fever) is an illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. Very common worldwide, it is transmitted by ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person. The bacteria then multiply in the blood stream of the infected person and are absorbed into the digestive tract and eliminated with the waste."

"Why can swallowing two magnets be fatal?
I read this in the Mattell Recall article today on Yahoo:\n\nThe CPSC said tiny magnets inside the dolls and accessories can fall out, and be swallowed by little children. When more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other, which can be fatal.\n\nWhat happens exactly when two magnets attract each other and they have been swallowed? What makes it fatal?
The attraction between the magnets causes widespread jealousy thought the cellular world. The cells, red blood cells especially (because of their high iron content), commit suicide en mass when they realize they will never be able to experience the magnets happiness."
"how do you brush a cats teeth?

Most larger pet stores sell small toothbrushes that will fit into a cat's mouth more easily, and some of the toothbrushes even slip over your finger.  There is also special flavored toothpaste that tastes better to the cat, although if you use a *tiny* amount of human toothpaste, it is OK too.  Just don't use the same amount that you'd use for yourself because it can upset their stomach.   Then just brush all the teeth carefully and rinse with a little bit of water.  Here is a very informative article:\n\nhttp://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=1&cat=1390&articleid=383"

"Why don't we almost have no tide water at all in sweden comparing to UK?

The tides depend on not only the forcing of the sun, moon and other celestial bodies, but they depend on the shape of the bottom topography, shape of the coastline, etc. \n\nThat is why in some places there are two high tides a day (so-called semidiurnal tides, like in most of the world), some places there is only one high tide a day (so-called diurnal tides, like in California), and even some places with no tides at all, or 3 or more high tides per day. \n\nThere are also tides in rivers and lakes, but of course you can only see them if these bodies of water are big enough. There is also a good sized tide in the solid earth, and in the atmosphere too, as you might expect."
"I know that if you have a bad liver alcohol and tylenol are not good to take, are any foods bad?any good foods

A lot of fatty or greasy foods are bad because they are broken down in the liver before going to the gallbladder. Follow your doctors recommendation's for diet, which is probably NO ALCOHOL, eat balanced proportioned meals. Ask your DR. what he thinks about using Milk Thistle as a supplement to your diet. It is a plant/herb that is a good cleanser for the liver as well as promotes healthy liver funtion. It can make you sick when first taking it tho as it is cleansing your liver of toxins (that are making you sick).Check with your doctor first as it may not be appropriate in your specific situation."

"I want somebody to please go into detail about men's minds.?
5 years ago I knew a guy.  I met him 10 years ago, but we were sort of acouple sort of NOT a couple.  I was too young then.  I am 23 right now.  Before 5 years ago, we had a somewhat sexual relationship.  Not a very verbal close one, but more of an understanding.  Well, I recently caught up with him again, and we started seeing each other and eventually slept together again.  He kept saying things like ""no matter who you marry you will always belong to me"" but not in that weird creepy way.  I also have two children, and he spent an entire day playing with them.  He kept holding my 8 month old son, and later told me he wants children in the future.  Now, the way we are, and with him being how vague he is, I am confused.  Was that at me, or was he saying he wants children just in general in the future?  He says that he ""cares"" for me all of the time, but won't say the L word.  I am in the process of a divorce from a man I did not know well and ended up getting broken bones from.  Ideas?
Sounds to me that he is trying to tell you that he wants kids with you. If he is saying he cares for you and then if he admires your son alot and says he wants kids at kind of at the same moment I believe he is insisting it with you. Love can be weird sometimes you never know how it will start out or end up its just that chance you take. If yall where together in present tense and now yall are back together it sounds to me yall have a very good connection and maybe yall will actually be together til the end. Hope this helps. And remember this is only my opinion."
"Lusting is apart of being in love,but it's also a sin.Wouldn't it be impossible to avoid lusting and breaking
gods commandments? If not all,most people will and have lusted   sexually after a person they like or love. So isn't that like a trap for all humans.....because the moment we lu we sin,and then we have to repent ,but we end up doing it again.
At any moment, every person reading this is committing some kind of sin.  Some sins are really bad (mortal); other sins are relatively mild (venial).  Essentially, at any moment a person is becoming either a more heavenly or more hellish creature, based on that person's will and decisions based on given circumstances.  The strong sexual attraction felt between a man and woman in a marriage is not sinful.  Looking at another person's spouse in a lustful manner is sinful.  The Lord knows every person's weaknesses, and even knows of any shameful perversions that might plague that person's mind--important thing is what that person tries to do; i.e., what decisions that person makes to the best of that person's abilities given the circumstances.  If you read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, he gives excellent insights into these ideas.  Hope this helps."
"Why is it they can send a man to the moon, but they can't make a deodorant that lasts past lunch?

Well, deodorants don't stop perspiration, they only make it more difficult for the perspiration to develop an odor. If you perspire a lot then it is really difficult to overcome that with only a deodorant.\n\nTry Mitchum antiperspirants, especially the unscented varieties. They work very well."

"Can anyone give me advise on Panic disorder and can you pass out during one?
I have had panic disorder for years now and can not get over the symptoms of feeling light headed when I drive and I am sooo afraid of passing out but my dr. keeps reassuring me to keep driving because it is rare to impossible to pass out...
When I first started getting panic attacks I hyperventilated a lot. My counselor said the only thing that could happen is that I would pass out and start breathing again. That was BAD information. I should have been given medication to prevent attacks.\nYour doctor sounds like a quack, go see someone else.\nIt may take time to find the right medication for you, but you have to keep trying. When you find the right one, you will feel SO much BETTER. \n\nHere is a link for you, I've copied some here for you. Good luck.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Panic Disorder?\n\nSymptoms of a panic attack, which often last about 10 minutes, include:\n\nDifficulty breathing. \nPounding heart or chest pain. \nIntense feeling of terror. \nSensation of choking or smothering.\nDizziness or feeling faint. \nTrembling or shaking. \nSweating\nNausea or stomachache.\nTingling or numbness in the fingers and toes. \nChills or hot flashes.\nA fear that you are losing control or are about to die."
"How do you rank Irish Gaelic by difficulty level to learn?
I speak only Portuguese(my mother language) and English(the easiest of the world). By reading about, I seem Irish Gaelic just as hard as German or Italian, slightly harder than English, and much easier than French, Portuguese, Finnish, Russian or Japanese. I would like to see comparisons between the languages above and that in focus.
Everything is relative from your mother tongue. You could say that Spanish is easy for you if you speak Portuguese but it might be not so easy for English speakers. Gaelic is such a small language that is really worth learning just so you can say you speak a rare language. GO FOR IT!!"

I went to catholic school for 9 years and you know studied the bible and did what I had to do for the grades, but I was never really about religion and never got the sign I was hopeing for or a strong reason to believe in it all...but now I'm not going to catholic school anymore. I thought my faith would grow as I got older and if I was open enough it would just come to me kinda. I still do pray sometimes, but I think thats out of fear but other than that reason I can't help but only pray when I want or need something. However I do believe in certain other things, and I think I believe in a god but no idea who or what...Am I doing something wrong?..like should I really be trying to gain faith?..the whole Catholic society to me, doesnt seem pure enough for god anymore.
that is your own personal struggle that only you can overcome or strengthen. you have to decide what seems right to you or how you want to pursue your faith. if you want you can ask ""god"" to answer your prayer. \n\ni use to be a devoted christian and doubted my faith because i felt that the church and the teachings were currupt and not ""holy"" as they claimed to be. i also struggled with this type of issue. today, im just a happy atheist. \n\ngood luck to you."

"if you have the power to solve sickness problems which one you will solve first aids, cancer, leuchemia?

Childhood cancer. I have never witnessed so much devastating suffering from children, siblings, mothers, fathers, grandparents, relatives, doctors, medical staff, teachers, schools, childhood neighbors, little friends, and entire communities. For those who have never encountered this first hand, there are no words to describe the horror. A childs face looking to his parents for answers, and there are none. A child wanting only comfort . . and there is none. Two parents rotating shifts for weeks on end to hold their dying child upright since that is the only comforting spot. A mother laying beside her dying child in the hospital and whispering in his ear that is okay to let go . . okay to die. So . . so . . so much pain. So many tears, and nothing to stop it. Faith helps, but not always. There are just too many broken hearts.\n\nIf I had the power to resolve any illness it would be to totally eliminate childhood cancer. Watching a child die who has never had the chance to live . . . is totally devastating to all involved."
"Why does it seem when older folks fall and break a hip after the fall they are never the same mentally?
Both my grandfathers fell,,,one ended up just getting bruises but ended up w/ dimentia and the other one fell and broke his hip and has never been the same since mentally.
You might be putting the cart before the horse there.  The dementia was probably there before the hip fracture, you just didn't notice it because the person was funtioning properly, more of less.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge (I am not a doctor, but I do work with the elderly), breaking a hip does not cause dimentia.\n\nDimentia can cause losing balance and breaking a hip."
"what is the probability of being dealt five spades in a hand of bridge?

First find the number of ways to have 5 spades in your hand.\nEach hand consists of 13 cards.  \nThat means 5 will be spades, and 8 will not be spades.\nThere are 13 spades in a deck and 39 cards that are not spades.\nThe number of ways of choosing 5 spades from 13 is\nC(13,5)\nThe number of ways of choosing 8 cards that are not spades from 39 is \nC(39,8)\nHence, the number of ways of having 5 spades is \nC(13,5)*C(39,8) = 1287*61523748 = 79181063676\nWe divide this number by the total possible number of 13 card hands, which is C(52,13) because you are choosing 13 cards from 52\nC(52,13) = 635013559600\nThus, the answer is\nC(13,5)*C(39,8)/C(52,13)\n= 79181063676/635013559600\n= .124691925832\nso there is approximately a .125 chance of being dealt 5 spades"

I had my new claims interview, then signed on one week later, and now, two weeks after that, my money is supposedly 'on it's way'. Housing benefit can take even longer, up to 2 months. It really, really, sucks - I just hope you have generous friends and live near a Netto."
"i need a job what do i do ?
i am 16. i have no job experience. im homeschooled. i have no idea what would be a good first job. i dont no where to start looking. i have filled out applications before, but i never no how to do it the way it should be done. nobodys ever helped me.
Where do you live and what is available?  Working summer jobs, seasonal ones like hotels, lifeguarding (are you certified?  It's easy and fast to learn), theme parks:  these are great first jobs because they give you some experience in the summer and they are used to working with younger workers.  Look online at the place's website.  Find a phone number, find the job opening part of the site if there is one.  Applications are easy, and when you come to the part that says 'former employers' you just leave that blank.  Asks where you go to school?  Homeschooled.  City and State.  Play soccer, baseball, good with money?  Add these things to the strengths portion, but don't go into great detail.  Employers who hire young workers like you are used to dealing with young workers.  So have your social security card handy as well."
"Why  the color of the sea is blue?

there are two reasons for the color of the sea:\n\nA. the sea reflects the sky.\nyou have probably noticed that the sea is not very blue-looking when the sky is overcast. water reflects and scatters the light that strikes it; this is shown by the fact that you can see your reflection in puddles. when the sky is brilliant blue, the sea is also, because it reflects the blue of the sky. \n\nB. blue light is more easily bent, or refracted, than red light. thus, light refracted back from the surface of the sea appears blue. furthermore, when you are underwater the water around you appears blue because more blue light is scattered back to your eye than red light."
"What if you were born as member of a different religion? Is it fair?
We know there are many different religions. And we assume  only one of them is the true one and they will deserve heaven. As a general rule people follow their family/clan's religion. So being the only christian member of a saudi arab family is out of question (this is just an example, you can change it to a jew child of a christian german family). \n\nWhat if you're born as a member of one of the false religions (put yourself on the other side for a while)? Is god favoring one clan over the others? That may mean god is treating 80% of human race unfairly... Why does god do that?
i asked a similar question recently about why all must hate other religions just because the people are taught the way they are. i am glad there are others who agree.\n\nMaybe God is testing us and seeing how we do with the free will he gave us"

"Explain the Stock market to me in simple terms Please.?
I wanted to know how it works and how a person can rather not get instantly wealthy but get a large return in profits from investing.
When you buy a share of stock, you're buy a piece of the company, even if it's only a very small piece.\n\nYou become an owner of that company along with anyone else who owns stock in it. Each share has a voting right, so you can vote for the board of directors, the auditors and any other issues.\n\nYou make money if the company does well, and receives more income than it costs to produce that income. You'll make money either by receiving a dividend, by selling the stock to someone else for more than you bought it, or both.\n\nCompanies also have down periods, and could lose money during this time, but only if you sell your stock. You may decide to hold on and wait  it out. Look at the people who held on to Apple Computers.\n\nThere are a lot of books that explain the stock market. You can find them at your local library."
"Lesbians: would you date a pre-op female to male transsexual?
What about a pre-op male-to-female transsexual?  She sees herself as a woman, lives as one, but still has male equipment.  Would that bother you?  \n\nAlso, in the case of dating a pre-op female to male transsexual, he would look like a man, live as one, but still have ""female"" equipment.  So, would it be easier for you to be with him, since he still has female parts?  \n\nIs your attraction really based on liking the same GENDER or liking the same SEX?
Well, I'm bisexual, but I would certainly date a pre-op female to male transsexual.  I'd just consider the ol' twig and berries to be, as they say in Carol Queen's ""The Leather Daddy and the Femme"", a 'wacky new type of strap-on'.  But then again, I'm the kind of girl who loves strap-ons, so for the lesbians who don't, it might not be that great of a situation.\n\nAnd I think it's a lot easier for lesbians to date pre-op female to male transsexuals if their lover was butch beforehand (the general case), and especially if they were stone butch- i.e. penetration never occurred anyways, and breasts were off-limits as well.  Not much would change.  I have a feeling the biggest detractor for lesbians whose partners transition is not what happens in the bedroom, but how they are perceived outside (as a heterosexual) and their own sense of self.\n\nLike I said before, I like gender and sex, and all the mixtures they come in- mostly when the bits don't match (like femme boys and butch girls)."

is this common?  do most men cheat on their wives?  after my mom found out, she confronted him on many occasions, but he refuses to stop.  do most men stop when they get caught?  please dont tell me my dad is a player, because thats fuckking gross, okay?
No it's not normal. Sorry to say, in my opinion it's sick. Your mom should kick him to the curb, and take him for all he's worth. I am amazed at some of the answers on here, I don't know what kind of men you associate with but cheating is not moral and it's disgusting. No one should tolerate cheating. And seeing these answers from women, wow, what in the world!!! I would not even consider dating a woman who is ok with cheating."

"what is astrology,palmistry or tarot card?
i hear from a lot of people they are both a science and a magic, whoever here know what is the trick in there, whether or not they are precise in forstalling the future, and if any online resource can help me learn these things
All of them are sciences or Arts. . But people master these subjects by reading books, or practice under a teacher of directly. There is not institution to teach these. But about 80 % of the person who are doing this are fake and take advantage of the people who are suffering in their lift for some thing or other and they look upon someone who give word of encoragement through these subect. The actual meaning of these sciences are -\n\nASTROLOGY - Astrology is a group of systems, traditions, and beliefs in which knowledge of the relative positions of celestial bodies and related information is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing knowledge about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial events. A practitioner of astrology is called an astrologer, or, less often, an astrologist. Historically, the term mathematicus was used to denote a person proficient in astrology, astronomy, and mathematics. Although the two fields share a common origin, modern astronomy is entirely distinct from astrology. While astronomy is the scientific study of astronomical objects and phenomena, the practice of astrology is concerned with the correlation of heavenly bodies (which historically involved measurement of the celestial sphere) with earthly and human affairs. Astrology is variously considered by its proponents to be a symbolic language, a form of art, science, or divination. The scientific community generally considers astrology to be a pseudoscience or superstition as it has failed empirical tests in controlled studies.\n\nPALMISTRY - Chiromancy or cheiromancy, (Greek cheir, “hand”; manteia, “divination”), is the art of characterization and foretelling the future through the study of the palm, also known as palmistry, palm-reading, chirology or hand analysis. The practice is found all over the world, with numerous cultural variations. Those who practise chiromancy are generally called chiromancers, palmists, palm readers or chirologists.\nModern palmistry can trace its roots back to Roma fortune tellers and Indian mystics, but often modern palmists combine traditional predictive techniques with psychology, holistic healing, and alternative methods of divination.\n\nTAROT CARDS - The tarot are a set of cards displaying allegorical representations originally used as playing cards and later for divination. Most modern tarot decks consist of 78 cards split into two major groups:\nThe major arcana, consisting of 22 trump cards (sometimes referred to as keys):"

is it as deadly as say, lung cancer?
Do not go by survival rates or statistics. They can be used as an overall tool, but you can not apply them to an individual. It just doesn't work that way.\n\nMuch depends upon an individuals overall health, age, the stage of the cancer, and the grade of the tumor. Much may also depend upon the skills of the oncologist, the ability of the patient to locate effective treatment options, and on lucky circumstances.\n\nYou can find survivors for all cancers, all stages, and all tumor grades . . people can beat the odds of their particular cancers.\n\nThat being said, you can find this type of information at the National Cancer Institute website. There is good information there about treatment options, diagnostics, and statistics:\n\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/head-and-neck/"

It may sound very bizarre, but if you are all stuffed up and can't blow your nose4...find a way to get yourself to cry. Either that or the steam from taking a hot shower will get the mucous flowing in your sinuses again so you can blow your nose and get it the infection out of your head as soon as possible.

"Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?
Isn't it awful that everytime we want go to the doctor office/clinics, they have to ask us why do we want to see a doctor, what sickness do we have.  I mean we are not doctors, how do we know about our sickness? That's why we want go to a doctor to get analysis and cure.  By the way, it's a patient privacy right.  Only doctors or nurses can get that information, not the operator/customer service.\nDo you agree?  What do you think?
well usually the customer service rep has a background in medicine, I've worked as an assistant to the doctor for years, and usually when I ask patients..i don't say WHY DO YOU WANT THE DOCTOR?..i usually just ask the patients..what are your symptons, so I can write it down in their file and the doctor knows what he's dealing with.

Hm. I have the tendency to sweat quite a bit ( in the armpits ) . I've been to my doctor once and the creams she gave me didn't really work ( and i dont really want to go back aha). And antiperspirants don't really help. Do you have any tips on how i can reduce sweat / the appearance of it (ex : wear dark clothing?) ...  -haha, can someone say EMBARRASSING?!-
do not get botox tyra is a dumb model. its actually one of two things: dont use anti perspirant there is aluminum in it and aluminum is the main ingrediant, it clogs the pores but the pores become engorged and the sweat just flows out when the pore cant hold anymore and thats what leaves the yellow stains on you light coloured shirts. the other thing it may be is just a disorder dr. drew was talking about it the other day adam corolla actually had the surgery to fix it all they do is make two little tiny holes in your side then they go in and clip two little clippy things on two of your nerves and it makes your sweating more proportional so your not just sweating in the armpits or for adam on the head. if you just cut out your anti perspirant though you can try just using alcohol free mouth wash and find a deoderant that doesnt use any aluminum or you can use baking powder. but do not inject botox (poison) into your body."

Differences between ad valorem taxes and real property taxes?
The phrase ad valorem is Latin for ""according to value"". In the case of municipal property taxes, property owners have their property assessed on a periodic basis by a public tax assessor. The assessed value of the property is then used to compute an annual tax, which is levied on the owner by his or her municipality. Ad valorem taxes such as this are incurred through ownership of an asset, and contrast to transactional taxes such as sales taxes, which are incurred only at the time of transaction.\n\nReal Property (real estate) is the rights to land and improvements to the land.

"Why do eggs take on the color of dye?
When you put an egg in dye, what is the scientific reason that the egg changes to the color of the dye?
simple, its all in osmosis. since outside the egg there is a high concentration of solute ( in this case the dye) , some of it goes inside so that the conentrations level out and reach equilibrium. That happens automatically, it goes with its concentration gradient: from high to low concentration. Same happens with water. if you put dye in a cup of water, the concentration of dye spreads along so that there is almost the same amount of dye in each place. the dye goes inside the egg cells thourgh the cell's membrane."

Yet another reason to take your shoes off when you get home instead of walking around on your carpet with your shoes on, spreading their filthy (probably-diseased) proteins all over your house."
"skin rash from allopurinol ,how is it dangerous?
After applying skin cream the rash was less.What happens if allopurinol is not stopped.There are no other side effects.Without allo he is getting frequent gout attacks
FIRST READ THE WARNING FOR ALLOPURINOL BELOW!\n\nWhere is the rash?\n\nBenadryl is great for problems with medicine related rashes, but it makes most people too sleepy to work or drive.\n\nIf the rash is in the mouth  or throat you can use benadryl syrup and rinse, or gargle, then spit it out. That way it works locally. Benadryl comes in an over the counter cream too, and in an ""insect sting stick"". Ask the Dr. too, there may be a substitute that causes fewer side effects.\n\nMonograph title\nALLOPURINOL - ORAL\n\nPhonetic pronunciation\n(al-oh-PURE-in-ohl)\n\nCommon brand name(s)\nZyloprim\n\nUses\nAllopurinol is an enzyme blocker that lowers high levels of uric acid in your body by decreasing the amount produced. It is used to treat gout and certain types of kidney stones. This drug is also used to prevent high uric acid levels in patients who receive cancer chemotherapy. Cancer cells that are destroyed with therapy release large amounts of uric acid into the bloodstream.\n\nHow to use\nTake this medication by mouth usually once daily after a meal to reduce stomach upset, or as directed by your doctor. It is best to drink a full glass of water with each dose and at least another 8 glasses (8 oz. each) a day while taking this drug in order to prevent kidney stones from forming.\n\nThis drug may rarely cause very serious (possibly fatal) allergic reactions. Stop taking allopurinol and SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IF ANY OF THESE ALLERGIC REACTION SYMPTOMS OCCUR: SKIN RASH, HIVES, ITCHING, SWELLING, (especially of the lips or mouth), dizziness, pain when urinating, blood in the urine, unusual eye redness/pain, fever and chills, muscle/joint pain, trouble breathing.If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."
"I really do need something explained to me.?
Seriously, I don't understand exactly how gay marriages affect mine and my husband's heterosexual marriage. What does that have to do with ""the sanctity of a union between a man and a woman""? I don't give a flip if they wanna get hitched!
to MISS POLY...you rub your marriage in my face. \nI have no idea why people are so against gay marriage...I am gay, and I do NOT want to get married. But, in fairness, the legal protections offered Straights are denied the same tax-paying gays...Gays have no rights of inheritance, Social Security Benefits, etc. I have known couples who spent a life together, both contributing equally to the assests, who, in stupidity, did not write iron-clad wills. The family of one who had died, came in, broke the will, and took everything that the couple had amassed in a lifetime, leaving the guy left behind with nothing! Things are pretty sad in this world, and this prejudice just makes things sadder. Oh, and by the way...your question wording is cute. I am gay and gray...well, what's left of it, anyway. :-)"
"does diet rich in sugar destroys our teeth?

Yes, because it feeds the bacteria which cause tooth decay.  But it also can wear out your pancreas so you get diabetes, and make you so fat you get a variety of other health problems, not to mention social ones.  A diet low in sugar is by far preferred.  Also, the more refined the sugar is, the worse it is for you.  So if you must have something sweet, use fructose, honey, and other less refined forms of sweetness.  Better still, break yourself of the habit of expecting things to be very sweet.  Tell yourself it is childish; that you are too old for that."
"does anyone know any kind of magic to get a landlord off my pack ?
Rent paid in ull but he is just a pain kids cant have friends over and my doors have cameras so he ee's who comes in ad out ? what should I do
If the camera's were mentioned in your lease, then you really can't do much. the landlord can't stop you from having guests, as long as your friends don't stay more than 14 days back to back in a calender year. The landlord can enter the apartment anytime, as long as they give the tenant a 24 hour notice, written not verbal either."
"Rejecting an offer letter after I've accepted it.?
I have been getting a lot of job offers and I accepted on two weeks ago for a start date after the 1st of the year. But I've been getting even more interest since I accepted and one offer is better than the one I accepted. Are there any implications to turning back on an offer already accepted? Like in college, if you sign a letter of intent and then go to another university it is a NCAA violation.
No, politely decline the first offer ""due to altered circumstances"", they still have enough time to fill it. However do not do this until you have a firm offer , in writing, for the second job."

"what two things are the cell membrane made up of?

There are two classes of molecules that make up the cell membrane. These are  lipids and proteins.\nLipids constitute the two layers called bilyer. A lipid has two ends. One is called head and the other tail.The former is hydrophilic and the latter is hydrophobic.The lipid molecules are arrayed in such a manner that the tails face each other while the heads are away.The heads are in contact with cytoplasm on the one hand and exterior on the other.The the heads interact electrostatically with proteins. Some proteins are buried in the bilayer, and some even project beyond the bilayer on both the surfaces. Carbohydrates are over-layered, that is, on the outer side of this complex. Some lipids are phophorylated. Cholesterol is also present in some quantity in the membrane."

"How did astronomers learn the earth's axis wobbles?

The basic observations were done thousands of years ago. THe ancient Greeks knew that the direction of the pole changes over time (also known as the progression of the equinoxes). Of course, it wasn't until recently that this effect was explained by the wobble of the earths axis. It used to be seen as just another cosmic cycle."
"What is Cesaro Summability?

If you want to do and infinite sum\nsum_1^infty a_n,\nit is usually done by taking the partial sums\ns_n=a_1+...a_n\nand taking the limit of these partial sums.\nFor Cesaro summability, let\nC_n be the average of the first n partial sums\nC_n=(s_1+...s_n)/n\nand take the limit of C_n as n goes to infinity.\n\nIt turns out that every infinite sum that converges in the usual way also converges to the same sum via Cesaro summability. But there are infinite sums with Cesaro sums that don't converge in the usual manner.\n\nFor example,\nsum (-1)^(n+1).\nThe partial sums look like\ns_1=1, s_2=0, s_3=1, s_4=0,....\nThis sequence of partial sums does not converge.\nHowever,\nC_1=1, C_2=1/2, C_3=2/3, C_4=1/2,...\nand it is easy to see that C_n has limit 1/2,\nso the Cesaro sum of this series is 1/2.\n\nThere are many other summability methods, for example Abel summability (which uses power series) and generalizations of Cesaro summability.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: the previous answerer defined c_n as the average of the original terms. THIS IS WRONG. You want the average of the partial sums."

"How do I choose a winning mutual fund?

Morningstar is a nice resource, but remember it is strictly backwards-looking analysis. Kiplingers is OK but is biased towards no loads. (There is a recent study out in the Journal of Financial Planning {October, 2005} that challenges the idea that index funds always outperform actively managed funds.\n\nHere's what I start with when looking for a fund to fill an asset category:\nPerformance relative to peers\nAsset size (Avoid the bloated funds)\nManager Tenure (Great 5 & 10 year numbers mean little if the manager has only been there for 2 years)\nFee structure\n\nThe important thing to remember is to allocate your assets in a manner in line with your time horizon and risk tolerance and DON'T CHASE PERFORMANCE.

"So why is he so jealous?
If god really is so omnipotent and omniscient, what's he so jealous of?
God is jealous in the sense of what His name means. That He is a God that requires our undivided love, devotion, attention and worship in spirit and in truth. He so requires this because this is the way He feels about us and adores us so by sending us His one and only beloved beautiful son Jesus Christ to take our place of death on the cross. Because God gave us His all, He demands the same from us which I believe is a fair request, don't you?"

"what kind of poisinous spiders or snakes you have in australia, here we have (usa) rattler, coral cotton mouth
spiders brown recluse, black widow, scorpions
Australia actually has more dangerous critters than the US:\nBox Jellyfish are responsible for more deaths in Australia than snakes, sharks, and salt water crocodiles put together. They can be found near the coast along all the Great Barrier Reef which extends as far as 2000 Km. Another poisonous jellyfish is the Irukandji, the smallest animal on earth capable of killing humans (only 1 centimetre or half an inch in length).\nThen there are lovely small but beautiful blue-ringed octopuses close to the beach, never attacking but only defending themselves against curious hands with a deadly poison man cannot counteract yet. \nOr the poisonous fish - the Scorpion Fish and the Stone Fish, living everywhere around Australia but loving coral. So wear shoes when you go into water. \nThere are about 30 species of poisonous sea-snakes - they won't hunt you but if you come too close and scare them, they'll bite and likely kill you anyway. \nAustralia has more than 100 kinds of poisonous snakes -- about a dozen of which rank among the most poisonous on earth (the top 8 most deadly snakes are all Australian). One of them is the coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)which sports the biggest fangs, one of the most lethal venoms and a rather aggressive nature\nAs for spiders - there are more than 40 species of funnel web spiders, a group of arachnids known for their toxic venom. Strangely enough, humans and other primates are maximally sensitive to funnel web venom but other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guineapigs, dogs and cats are relatively immune and often survive 100 times the human lethal dosage.\nThey even have a poisonous egg-laying mammal - platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). On the back legs of mature males are a pair of short spurs each hooked-up to a venom gland that makes a viciously painful toxin. It causes pain strong enough to induce vomiting which can persist for days, weeks or even months. The pain is resistant to morphine and other pain-killing drugs and anaesthesia of the main nerve from the spur site is often the only way to relieve the patient's suffering."

Journal your food and workouts to keep closer tabs on calories that you take in and the calories that you burn.  You might find that you are eating more than you realized or not working out as much as you think.  Or you could be eating too little, causing your body to go into starvation mode.  Once you have the results from your journal, if you don't find anything off, ask again with more details."
"When I get a rocky road square with stale marshmallows (in a cafe), am I entitled to ask for a fresh one?
Can you get a refund on subpar desserts at a cafe?
Of course you can. Take it back and ask for a replacement or a refund. In Britain all sales are bound under 'The Sale Of Goods Act' which stipulates that anything sold must be fit for the purpose for which it is bought. If not then a mandatory refund must be given either by way of giving back the money paid or providing a replacement that fulfills the need. Don't know which country you're in but most have pretty similar legislation."
"why do companies pay benefits, health insurance, and retirement benefits instead of paying a higher wage?
Wouldnt it make more sense if the company let the employees decide how they should allocate their earnings between health insurance and retirement and so forth?
Higher wages is about attracting employees, while benefits packages are about retaining employees.  It is much more efficient to keep an employee around after they have been trained.  Most retirement plans, stock option packages, insurance benefits, etc. are designed to pay higher rewards to those with greater tenure so the longer you are around, the more expensive it becomes to leave."

"What exactly is meant by blasphemy against the holy spirit?
And what exactly is the holy spirit?\nIwas raised Christian but I never really heard a decent explanation of this so called unforgivable sin.
Think of the Holy Spirit as light.  An easy analogy is to imagine God as the Sun and Jesus Christ as a perfect mirror of that Sun.  The Holy Spirit would be the rays of the Sun, that we then see reflected in the Mirror (Christ).  \n\nMany people did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah because He did not appear in the way they imaagined He would.  They loved God and worshipped Him in the way they knew best -- God can forgive them for not recognizing Jesus, because they can change when they realize Who He is.  Those who blaspheme against the holy spirit hate the light -- they don't care if it is Jesus, Moses or Mohammed (or others) -- they hate it.  God cannot forgive them because they have shut themselves away from His forgiveness.\n\nOr to put it another way -- suppose I have 5 lamps in my house.  It is dark and you want to read.  I turn on a lamp and you say ""No, I don't like that lamp.  Use this one""  Ok, you can still read.  But if you say ""You have ugly lamps and the light hurts my eyes"", then you will remain sitting in the dark."

"How can I build a wormhole?
I read somewhere it might actually possible to travel back in time by rotating a very heavy object at very high speed.  Can anyone provide a link explaining how this is possible?  I want to actually see the math so I know exactly how much weight would have to be rotated and how fast it would have to rotate.  If you think it's impossible, feel free to provide a link that explains why it's not possible.
Enstien modeled the space-time as a fabric that can stretch and squeeze when an object is laid on it. The heavier the object, the more it curves the space-time fabric. As the object’s mass tends to infinity (black-hole), the curvature will tend to a hole (wormhole).\n\nAnti-gravity, aka exotic energy (negative energy), has an opposite effect to the space-time fabric. So if you happen to discover how to make this negative energy, you would be able to open up a wormhole and keep it open. Theoretically that is!\n\nIf you fancy to read the mathematics of this theory, I suggest you do the General Relativity graduate course… I must warn it has serious hardcore mathematics. Here’s a link:\n\nhttp://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan_Waner/diff_geom/tc.html"

This is what my notes say:\n2 factors control ADH release: ECF osmolarity and BP (blood volume).\nThe most potent stimulus is high blood osmolarity.\n\nSo my question is, does blood osmolarity meen ECF osmolarity or blood volume?
Blood osmolarity is referring to ECF osmolarity - they equilibrate with each other and are thus nearly identical. High osmolarity is sensed by central osmoreceptors, which prompt ADH secretion. The blood volume is a second separate signal to secrete ADH; these receptors are in the peripheral vasculature."

the pain sometimes is very intense, but in between that its still there but not as strong. it feels like my uterus is too tight and i cant stand up straight. when i urinate the pain becomes even stronger. i have had a blatter infection before and its not really like that. it doesnt burn when i urinate its just like cramping feelings. and now when i do urinate ive noticed a little bit of spotting. i dont think its my period because its been like this for a few days now and usually when i do have my period i bleed within the first day i see the spotting. should i see a doctor?
There are lots of possible causes for pain in this area.  Period pains and bladder infections are just two of them.  If your pain is severe, go see an Emergency Doctor.  Otherwise, you should take a pregnancy test.  If this is positive, then you should still go see an emergency doctor, as you may be having a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.  If the test is negative, then make an appointment to see your family doctor in the next 24 to 48 hours.  Other possible causes include (but are not limited to) pelvic infection, appendicitis and endometriosis."
"what happens to pressure of a gas in a container if temperature of the gas increases?

Pressure will increase if temperature increases, assuming that the container remains at a constant volume. Because the molecules are moving faster, they collide more often with the walls of the container, so the pressure goes up.\n\nThis is demonstrated by Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that that for a fixed amount of gas (fixed number of moles) at a fixed volume, the pressure is proportional to the temperature, so:  P/T = constant.\n\nIn case you need to know this for a test, and easy mnemonic  is ""Pete and Tom are Gay"" (Pressure and Temperature are proportional according to Gay-Lussac)."

"what is rehabilitation centre and  hospice?

A rehabilitation center usually consists of having ""in-house"" patients.  It is not quite a hospital but something very similiar where some patients go to after the hospital because they still need constant care and are going to different kinds of therapies, depending on their illness.  Hospice is for the people who are dying.  My husband went through hospice when he had cancer and was dying.  Hospice is a wonderful group that helps you during the patients last months/weeks/days.  They supply you with nurses, social workers, supplies, etc."
"Please help me....?
I have not been sleeping well for more than a month now. I only doze off for an hour or two close to the morning. Is there something I can do without seeing a doctor? I am looking forward to your advice.\nThank you so much.
Seriously, your best bet is to see a doctor.  I had insomnia for 3 years- I slept only 2-4 hours a night and it drove me crazy.  The doctor put me on Ambien - which helped a lot.  \n\nThere are plenty of over the counter drugs that you can take to help you sleep as well.  Keep in mind though- all these drugs are ""habit forming"" - I think it is because once you start sleeping well, you start to worry that you won't if you don't take the drugs.\n\nAre you staying awake because you are stressed out about things?  You could also try meditation or something to clear your mind so that you aren't as tense when you are trying to sleep.\n\n\nGood luck."

It is reverse racism, and I do not agree with it. Some white people feel guilty over their ancestors' role in the history and let black people get away with it, and some black people fully exploit the situation. I think no one should use any derogatory terms towards another person. We should all try to let go of the past and move on towards a better tomorrow."

"what are smart materials ?
does anybody know about smart materials ? i have a research paper about it due in few days. please help!
Smart materials are materials that, due to a change in their crystalline structure (martensitic to austenitic structure and back if I remember correctly), change also their shape with a temperature change.  It can go from electrical connectors that, when cold, become bigger thus allowing an easy connection and that, at room temperature, create a secure connection AND also easy to break without damage.  There was, I think, also an artist that created a statue that was changing from a woman's to a man's shape depending on temperature.\nThese materials can be very useful in the space industry where they can be used to activate the deployment of a solar panel, for example.\n\nThese materials are not limited to a change of shape with temperature but all changes of physical properties can be achieved with a change in their environment (a viscosity change or a change of light transmittance with a change in the electrical current flowing through the material, etc...)"

Thinking about joining Curves...anyone have anything positive or negative to say about this place?
I have been a member of Curves since June of last year and have lost 30 pounds.  I LOVE CURVES!!  I enjoy the people who work there and the other women who go there.  Its much more fun to go when you have buddies.  I have been a member of the YWCA and another ladies gym but never stuck with it until now.  \n\nThe approach is easy to understand, 3 times a week, 30 minutes each time, and you get a full body workout.  They also have a weight management class you can take (offered several times a year) and that is good because it gets you off the perpetual dieting. \n\nBut the one thing that I love about CURVES more than anything else is the travel pass.  I have to travel a lot with my job, and with the execption of one city I have to visit, all the other cities I visit have a CURVES location.  Not just in state but out of state.\n\nBY the way if you join before March 11, 2006 and bring in a bag of non perishable food items, your joining fee is waived. \n\nGOOD LUCK!"
"Do any of you believe in mermaids??? Do they even excist??
I remember like 5 or 6 yrs ago I saw this one show on the Discovery Channel about the whole thing with strange creatures and they found a skeleton of a baby mermaid it was like real skeleton and they had it in some kind of display , they even showed pictures of a mermaid from far away.............but I wonder.....Could it be true?? Any websites to find info on them??
Are you kidding me? OF COURSE MERMAIDS EXIST! Actually if you want to be convinced or are willing to be, it should be quite an easy concept to understand. OK, people evolved over the years into what we are to day but originally we came from the seas. So our closest relatives are the mermpeople. They are almost extinct because of things like ocean pollution and they are nocturnal so they live in the deepest darkest reaches of the ocean where our human eyes are unable to see. People say, but if they exist why have i never seen one? Answer me this, if you were a mermaid/merman who everyone was dying to catch in a net and take to lab would you want anybody to see you?"

It is our eyes that lead us to do sinful things...like lust, adultery, etc.  And if not our eyes, then our mouths...like gluttony, alcoholism, slander, gossip.

"why we can not apply aronoutical technologies in automobiles?
both automobiles & aeroplane run fast ,then why we cannot use aeroplane technology in automobiles?
Making something go fast is not all that difficult much of the time, it is about making it *controllable*. Speed (power) is nothing without control.\n\nIn the air, not only do you have the option of full 360 degree movement options (esp with rotating wing aircraft), you do not have ""blind corners"", slippery road surfaces and sodding speed cameras.\n\nIn many ways we DO embrace much of the other technology though, from lighter materials, more aerodynamic design and advanced navigational facilties (FRED / GPS) etc\n\nOne thing that has never seemed to make it to the road is an engine with twin spark plugs - a requirement on all conventional engined aircraft. Not only does it give backup (less critical on the road) but ALSO makes a fair difference in economy. When switching magnetos (ignition) from BOTH to Left or Right, a drop of 50-100 RPM is not uncommon - suggesting strongly that the additional spark does indeed improve effieicney and power output.\n\nAeroplane engines are also happy to be leaned out considerably more than automobile engines. Again allowing for greater economy AND power.\n\nAre there any other technologies you are thinking of specifically that you think should be incorporated into cars?"

"if you are gay, how do you let another man know you want to be with him?
you just don't want a rejection trip.\nand hopefully keep an enjoyable friendship.
First of all, ask yourself why do you want to be with him.   Is it just because he's hot, or more than that. \nNext, make sure he's gay or willing to be gay.\nYour approach often depends on the situation.   If you are in a bar, or a situation where alcohol or another substance is being consumed by you and others, you could stand to be a little bit more forward, such as asking him if he would like to stop by your place.\nHowever, if you're approaching him in a non mind-altering substance situation, you might want to try a more subtle approach.   You could go on an outing together, a trip, or maybe invite him over for dinner.\nUsually, if you answer the first 2 questions mentioned above, it should be relatively easy to ""be with him"".\n\nGood luck."
"What did Herbert Spencer invent?
This is reference to the philosopher Herbert Spencer who was a practicing engineer at one time.
Herbert Spencer was born in Derby, April 27, 1820, the son of William George Spencer (he was called George), an officious but respected educator. Coming from a family of teachers (including his grandfather and uncle) he was encouraged to learn at an early age. During his childhood he was exposed to and enjoyed the many academic books and journals his father made use of. When he was 13 his father sent him to the Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, where his uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, could provide him a more formal education. He did not get along with his uncle at first, finding him to be a bore and resisting his lessons in Latin and Greek and even going so far as to run away back to his father’s home. However, he eventually came to co-exist with his uncle, developing his earliest political and economic ideas in response to Thomas’ radical reformist views. In 1836 his uncle obtained for him a job as a civil engineer on a railway, an experience that deterred him from pursuing a future in professions where he felt bosses exploited the labour of overworked staff. More notably, Spencer began committing his thoughts to paper during this period and, upon visiting his uncle some years later at the age of 22, he was encouraged to send a number of letters on politics to a radical newspaper called The Nonconformist. This was the beginning of his involvement in both journalistic media and socio-political rhetoric and the letters would later be published at Spencer’s expense as ""On The Proper Sphere of Government"".\n\nThese early works demonstrated a liberal view of workers' rights and governmental responsibility. He continued in this vein by developing a rationalist philosophy concerning the natural laws of progress. These views would mature into his 1851 manuscript Social Statics, a document that stressed the importance of looking at the long-term effects of social policy with respect to the nature of man. Spencer is often quoted out of context, making him seem uncompassionate toward the poor and working class. In actuality he stressed ""positive beneficence"" and man's evolving ""moral faculty,"" and was ahead of his time in promoting the rights of women and children. It was here that Spencer began developing his view of civilization, not as an artificial construct of man, but as a natural and organic product of social evolution. Since this ""social Darwinism"" precedes ""The Origin of Species,"" it would be more accurate to refer to Darwin's ideas as ""biological Spencerism."" After a five-year stint as sub-editor of the London financial paper The Economist that ended in 1853, Spencer began investing all his time towards writing professionally. In the immediate years following he would produce works concerning education, science, the railway industry, population explosion and many other philosophical and sociological topics.\n\nIn 1855 Spencer wrote the Principles of Psychology, which explored a theory of the mind as a biological counterpart of the body rather than as an estranged opposite. In this model human intelligence was something that had slowly developed as a response to its physical environment. Such an evolutionary standpoint on the origin of man alienated conservative publishers, once again leaving Spencer to publish his work at his own expense. During the writing of Principles of Psychology Spencer traveled about Wales and France and it was during one of these trips that his health underwent a decline from which it never fully recovered. Although it couldn’t be said exactly what was wrong with him, Spencer suffered from a constant tiredness that made his sleeping patterns short and erratic and prevented him from long periods of work. While he blamed stress and the possibility of having underdeveloped lungs, the continued deterioration of his health in later years was likely the result of a growing dependency on morphine and opium.

"what are the natural ways to enlarge the penis?

Jelqing is a good way to increase penis size not by making muscles stronger because penis contains no muscles but by revealing The spongy tissue stronger and more acceptable for bloodflow\nSo try it but stick to the rules or u'll hurt ur penis and cut the nerves\n\nAbout the Technique\nThe basic function of the Jelq technique is to lengthen and thicken your penis. By performing this easy exercise on a regular basis (4-5 days a week) it is possible, for example, that a man with six-inch member (erect) will add approximately two to four inches to the length of his penis. \nThe Jelq exercise works by forcibly pushing an increased amount of blood into the Corpora Cavernosa (spongy tissue of the penis). By repeating this exercise, the spaces in the penis will continually stretch larger.\n\nWith time the spaces in the penis will grow to allow more and more blood to fill the area, allowing the penis to thicken as a result. Similarly to a regular workout, the spaces will continue to get larger and stronger, healing at night while you sleep. This is what makes the Jelq such a powerful exercise.\n\nImportant Notes to Remember\n\n1. Perform a warm up before you begin the Jelq\n\n2. The selected lubricant should be Vaseline, skin lotion, skin oil or petroleum jelly. In no circumstance should soap be used!!\n\n3. The exercise should NOT be performed during a hard erection! If the exercise is performed in such a state vascular (vein) damage may occur.\n\n4. A moderate grip should be applied. If a hard grip is used some bruising and or the rupturing of superficial blood vessels could result. If any such problems should result, you should wait approximately 24-48 hours (or until the problem has healed) before continuing with the Jelq. \n\n5. Start out the exercise gradually, and slowly work up to an appropriate level. By doing this you will be able to minimize any slight bruising or red spots.\n\n6. If you feel the urge to ejaculate while partaking in the Jelq, squeeze the head and hold to discourage it, or simply stop the exercise for a few moments and wait until you have restrained the urge. \n\n7. Upon completion of each session perform another ""hot wrap"" with a wash cloth to arouse your penis and keep the increased blood held within it.\n\nStandard Jelq - Watch Tutorial Video\n\nStart by rubbing approximately one-half a teaspoon of Vaseline, skin lotion, skin oil or petroleum jelly in to both of your palms and penis. When performing this exercise your penis needs to be semi-erect, as a fully erect penis is of no use. If you find yourself becoming aroused simply stop the exercise until your full erection goes away.\n\nWith your thumb and forefinger on your right hand, form an ""ok"" symbol. Once you have formed this symbol, take your thumb and forefinger and squeeze your penis shaft as close to your scrotum as possible. While maintaining a tight grip, pull your hand downward towards the top of your penis, stopping just before you reach the glans (head). As you slide your hand downward, the head of your penis should noticeably expand.\n\nAs, or just before you release your penis from the grip of the right hand, place your left hand at the bottom of your shaft repeat this movement. This act should be continually preformed, switching from the right hand to the left in a ""milking"" manner. It is important that a tight grip is sustained around your penis with your thumb and forefinger as you perform this action, while the head of your penis expand as a result of the increased amount of blood flowing to the glans.\n\nThroughout the initial week of performing this exercise, limit the amount you jelq each day to around 10 minutes. After this initial week, try to work up your sessions to around 20 minutes a day. Than after about 2 weeks, work yourself up to jelq sessions that last 30 minutes or so. After about a 3-4 week period results should start to become noticeable.\n\nThe Jelq & Hold - Watch Tutorial Video\n\nMas"

"Will insurance cover more than one breast ultrasound per year?

It depends on the type of insurance you have.  You can always call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask them.  Otherwise, generally they will pay if there is a reason to.  For instance, if there are suspicious lumps or leaking from the nipple or a newly inverted nipple would all be reasons to evaluate what is going on."

Compassion without Passion is a balm for the wounded, but ultimately can't shake things up enough to actually create radical and lasting change. \n\nI think all three of these people were deeply compassionate -- but their passion for tearing down walls of injustice maybe wasn't quite as empowered and awakened as their compassion. \n\nNow Martin Luther King, on the other hand, was equipped with both -- and the results of his work are proof of that.

I know in my field, education, they don't require transcripts because I have a license to prove that I did graduate. Though when I work in child care (preschool positions) they require a copy of my transcripts. \n\nIt really honestly depends on the field. Some would just require a copy of your diploma others probably want to see a transcript so they can see that you did graduate from college. This is especially true if they require that you have a college degree for the position. This way somebody of the street can't just claim they have one when in deed they don't.\n\nAlso in terms of the interview. Please don't follow the suggestion of the person above me. You want to put yourself in a good light when interviewing. Telling them you bomb on tests will most definitely put a bad taste in their mouth. Also if you use that in my opinion it looks like you are looking to justify it or gloss it over. Most won't pour over your grades on the transcript if they do they are generally only there to prove your degree."

"what is the origin of heavier particles?

Supernovae throw off some heavy crap when a star explodes.\n\nTake a look at the following link.  The graphe shows that iron is a special element.  When you fuse lighter elements, you release energy, and when you let heavier elements decay, you get energy.  But iron is going nowhere.  So a star starts out with lighter elements, which fuse and create heavier elements.  The more the sun uses up the small elements, the denser the core gets, and the more rapidly it fuses in the core.  Eventually, when most of the elements are used up, you'll have the core collapse and throw off the outer layers in a massive thermonuclear explosion.  The remaining material will mostly be iron, and the star will glow white-hot as a white dwarf for many years, until it evenbtually cools off and goes dark.  But some heavier elements will be thrown off by the explosion, including some that, in the rapid collapse, jumped the iron gap and absorbed energy from the nuclear explosion to become heavier than iron.  These heavier things will decay over time, releasing energy by fusion."

This study aimed to establish Metro-Manila (Philippines) norms for the Denver Developmental Screening Test and to determine the characteristics of children whose scores are normal and those whose scores are abnormal or questionable on the test. The subjects were 6,006 children from 4,846 households of Metro-Manila. Probit analysis established the ages at which 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the sample passed each of the 105 test items. Discriminant analysis showed four clusters of factors that were significantly associated with children's performance. These were a substitute-care-giver variable cluster, a mother variable cluster, a child-situational variable cluster, and an age variable cluster."
"speed of electricity?
Is it possible to plug a power strip into itself? It doesnt neccessarily have to allow something to run off of it, but just so that the light will continue to show? If so, how long would it have to be?
There is not one speed to electricity, there are two.\n\nThe electron drift rate, determined by the number of conductors, the applied, field, and the mean free path, and the field transfer rate aka the speed of light in the material.\n\nAll conductors have resistance - its like friction for electricity.  Even ""superconductors"" have it, thought its a lot less than in other conductors.  Just like a ball you roll eventually stops, so will electron motion.\n\nIf you had a superconducting power strip, and a very fast plugger, you could make it plug into itself and it would glow for a long time.  The light would make it glow for a lot less long of a time.  Thats all about initial current voltage, and internal resistance."

"Why are there so many old people living alone by themselves in Arizona ??
Is this a common phenomenon in other states too or what?  Do their families not like to live with them or what?
Arizona is turning into the new Florida.  It's a retirement mecca now.  Most elderly folks you see are Bachelors and Bachelorettes who were divorced, widowed, or never were married.  I guess they pick Arizona because it makes them feel more comfortable to be single in a warm dry place.\nIn the next several years, I'm sure lots of people single & married will flock to Arizona to retire because Florida seems to be getting crowded with the youth(including myself)."
"what is an abcyst? Am i spelling that right?

The correct spelling is abscess and it is an infection in the pulp (nerve) of a tooth.  An antibiotic is the only way to treat an abscess and clear up the infection.  Left untreated, the infection of an acscessed tooth could spread to other areas of the body and the person could find themselves in a hospital and at the worst it could even cause death.\n\nAn abscess will present itself on an xray of the tooth.  Sometimes, although not always, the person may have a pustule (puss pocket) on the gum near the infected tooth where the infection is trying to find a way to escape the body."

"What is a abstract and a hypithesis, and how do I do them?
I'm doing a science project on the disease Gangrene....""What is Gangrene and how do you treat it?"" I got all my info. I just need to know how to do the abstract
There is an “O” in hypothesis. Spelling is important.\n\nAnyway, and abstract is just a short summary of what you did and what you found, typically one or two paragraphs. Without knowing what you did it’s hard to describe in more detail, but it’s something along the lines of \n\n“Abstract: The legs of 24 people were hacked open using a blunt axe. The victims were observed over the course of 14 days for the development of gangrene. 17 of the 24 victims developed gangrene within 3 days, and 23 of the 24 developed gangrene within the study period. The development of gangrene showed no correlation with the age or weight of the victims.”\n\n\nThe abstract has to be written AFTER you finish the rest of the project since it should contain the essence of everything you did.\n\nThe hypothesis is basically what you believed would happen before you started. More or less what it was you set out to prove. Something like “The chance if developing gangrene from blunt axe wounds increases with the age of the victim”."

Hep C is mostly spread by blood, but other body fluids (like those involved with sex) can cause it to spread to others as well.\nSo unless you or your daughter have been having sex with your parents or touching their open wounds (or blood in any form) you should be safe.

"Is Montgomery Ward still in business, if so who owns it ?

No, the company went bankrupt and closed all its stores in 2001. Here are the details:\n\nIn August 1999 the company emerged from Chapter 11 after being acquired by GE Capital, which gave up $1 billion in claims against the retailer. As part of the deal, the Financial Assurance unit of GE Capital acquired Montgomery Ward's Signature Group direct marketing arm. \n\nDespite the company's revitalization efforts, sluggish sales in the 2000 holiday season proved lethal, and in December Montgomery Ward said it would close its doors. In early 2001 it announced all of its retail locations and other operating real estate assets would be sold to REIT Kimco Realty, Simon Property Group, and Schottenstein Group."
"What causes the different solubilities of cellulose and cellulose acetate in dichloromethane?

Cellulose is a sugar polymer which has 2 free secondary and 1 free primary alcohol per repeating unit. This makes cellulose quite polar and will make it more soluble in solvents which have strong hydrogen bonding for solubility, such as MeOH, EtOH, DMSO, H2O etc\n\nIn cellulose acetate many of these hydroxyl groups are acetylated and therefore making cellulose acetate less polar than cellulose.  This makes cellulose acetate more soluble in less polar solvents, such as DCM. (dichloromethane)."

"what is life? What is the purpose of life? Why we live on earth and why we born in different families like   ?

PLEASE READ THIS FULLY\n\nPeople everywhere are asking the questions; ""What is the purpose of life?"" and ""Why are we here?"" \n\nMost of those who reflect or think about life in any detail will consider and ponder these questions. There are as many different answers to these questions as there are people asking the questions. Some would hold that the purpose of life was to acquire wealth. Yet suppose they were to acquire millions of dollars, what then would they claim is their purpose after doing so?\n\nIf the purpose of life is to become wealthy, there would be no purpose after becoming wealthy. \n\nThe fact is that when people approach their purpose here in this life from the aspect of only gaining wealth, after collecting the money they have dreamed of their lives loose purpose and then they live in restless tension suffering from a feeling of worthlessness.\n\nHow could wealth then be considered as the aim of life?\n\nCould the acquisition of wealth guarantee happiness? Of course not.\nWhen we hear of millionaires or members of their families committing suicide, how could we consider the purpose of life would be to gain great wealth?\n\nA child of 5 years would obviously prefer a new toy to a deposit slip for a million dollars.\nA teenager does not consider millions of dollars in the bank a substitute for movies, videos, pizza and hanging out with his friends. \nA person in their 80s or 90s would never consider holding on to their wealth in place of spending it to hold on to or regain their health.\n\nThis proves that money is not the main purpose at all the stages of one's life.\n\nWealth can do little or nothing to bring happiness to one who is a disbeliever in Almighty God, because regardless of what he or she would gain in this life they would always live in fear of what will happen to them in the end. They would wonder what would become of them and how they would end up.\n\nWealth and its accumulation as a purpose would be doomed to a temporary success at best and in the end it would only spell out self destruction.\n\nSo, what is the use of wealth to a person without belief? He would always fear his end and would always be skeptical of everything. He may gain a great material wealth but he would only lose himself in the end.\n\nWorship of the One True Almighty God of the Universe [Allah in Arabic] as a primary goal or aim in life provides a believer with everything he needs to succeed in both this life and the Next Life.\n\nThe word for total surrender, submission, obedience, purity of heart and peace in the Arabic language is ""Islam"". Those who try to perform these actions are called ""MU-slims"" [Islam-ERs]. \n\nTo a Muslim the whole purpose of life is ""ibadah"" or worship to the One True Almighty God on Terms and under His Conditions.\n\nThe term ""worship"" to a Muslim includes any and all acts of obedience to Almighty Allah.\n\nSo his purpose of life is a standing purpose; Worshipping Allah by accepting Allah's Will over his own.\nThis act of ibadah [worshipping, thanking and extolling the Greatness Almighty Allah on His Terms and Conditions] is for the Muslim, throughout his whole life regardless of the stage. Whether he is a child, adolescent, adult or aged person, he is seeking after the Will of the Almighty in all these stages.\nHis life here on earth although short, is full of purpose and is totally meaningful within the complete framework of total submission [Islam].\n\nSimilarly, in the Next Life as well, his faith, intentions, attitudes and good deeds will all be weighed into his account as favorable putting him in high esteem with his Creator and Sustainer.\n\nBecause Islam teaches that this life is only a test or trial for the individual to show him his true nature it is only natural that he would accept death as not so much an ending to everything but more as a beginning of the final and lasting life in the Hereafter.\n\nBefore entering int"
"why is my daughter running a high fever and has been on an antibiotic for 4 days now?
my daughter has been congested for about 3 weeks now.  i took her to the doctor last week and they said she had a little fluid in her left ear...but not ear infection.  they gave me a antibiotic and some cough medicine.  she has been taking the 7 day dose for 3 days and has been running a fever of 99 to 101.  i continue to break it but then it later comes right back.  is it likely to get a fever taking an antibiotic...she is 2 1&#92;2 years old.  i have called her doctors office and they have not returned my call.
A fever is the body's way of fighting off infection. You can use meds to get it to ""go away"" but if she is fighting something off it is not necessarily a bad thing unless it is too high.  My son did the same thing a few months ago but his fevers persisted at a much higher temp, think he had roseola.  If it is a virus, it will just have to run it's course.  Anibiotics are not effective against viruses, just bacterial infections.  At her age, fever is usually considered to be 103 or higher (it is lower for younger babies).\n\nAll those that are telling you to go to the E.R. and/or to get another anitibiotic are a little over the top.  99-101 is only a low grade temp.  GEEZ people!!! Don't stress this mom out!"
"why indian womens should not perform prayers during menstruation?

Because we women are just not nice during this time.  We're liable to tell God off during that time.\n\nNooooooooo, I'm ONLY kidding.\n\nI don't know.  I assume it does have to do with purity.  But I can't go without praying at any time, let alone that time!\n\nThe following is from http://www.beliefnet.com/story/104/story_10493_2.html\n\nNot only ancient Hindu society but practically all religious cultures of premodern times considered the menstrual period of women unclean in the least. This uncleanness involved more than ritual uncleanness and often sentenced women to solitary confinement during their cycle. Thus we are left to conclude that either pre-modern religious cultures knew more about women's menstrual period than we do today, or that premodern understanding of this period was uninformed on some level. \n\nThe latter seems more likely, and one merely needs to read up on the varied fears premodern cultures had about this period in a woman's life to know that their understanding involved considerable superstition. Hindu culture is no exception. Indeed, even the most orthodox Hindus have altered their position on this issue in today's world, while for the most part holding on to some part of premodern thinking about it with regard to ritual purity. Thus while Hindu women are no longer confined to solitude, and the clothes worn during their monthly cycle are no longer burned, they are often prohibited from ritual worship and even entering the temple. In my opinion, it is likely that these current prohibitions will also be lifted in time. The main concern in Hinduism seems to be with regard to bleeding, as even men who are bleeding from any particular ailment are not allowed to participate in ritualistic worship. However, today the question remains as to whether modern methods of cleanliness that control bleeding do not change the equation.\n\nIn my particular lineage, there is already a difference of opinion. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura states in his Bhagavad-gita commentary on Bg. 9.26 that the word prayatatmanah refers to physical purity and thus prohibits women from engaging in temple worship during their menstrual period. But my own guru considered that such worship did not contradict the guidelines outlined by the lineage's founders. In this regard he wrote, ""According to the smarta viddhi, women cannot touch the Deity during their menstrual period, but the goswami viddhi allows. But it is better not to do it. One thing is that the seva can never be stopped for any reason. This also for the cooking."" (Here Prabhupada implies that women can do these services for the Deity during their menstrual cycle if necessary.) \n\nIn the bhakti tradition, God is more accessible, especially Krsna. However, overall in this age (Kali-yuga) the most effective spiritual practice is chanting God's names, and there are no prohibitions for Krsna kirtana. Such chanting can be performed by anyone at any time under any circumstance."
"How much mass must be added to Mars to make it the same size as planet Earth?
If the human race wants another planet to colonize; Mars is a good candidate. However, it is smaller than earth and has two moons. The asteroid belt can be used to bombard Mars with asteroids that would increase its' mass and move it into a water liquid orbit around our sun, Asteroids could also be used to combine the two moons and increase their mass. Extra points:what would be the energy required to provide the motion to move the asteroids to Mars and to move Mars to a new orbit with its new moon?
not sure about the mass and size, i always thought mars is bigger than earth? just are you sure your questions are sensible coz as far as i remember, we on earth are still trying to figure out how to get there."

One place to look can be found in the Dow Jones dividend ETF DVY.  Go to the list of the holdings and take a look.

With the Dow Jones Dividend index they are steady paying stocks, which sounds like good dividend experience to me.  You can buy DVY for something around $68 a share, or pick out something you like from the list of those included."

"What is function notation and what is it for?

Function notation--which confuses a lot of people but it isn't that complicated--is a shorthand way of expressing formulas in mathematics (perhaps especially in algebra).\n\nSuppose, for example, that I have a formula for something.  Let's just use something silly, like the number of playing cards spread out on the table is equal to 52 times the number of decks that I opened.  So my formula is 52x.\n\nBut now think about how I use this.  ""If I have one deck opened, replace the x with 1.""  ""If I opened two decks, replace the x with 2.""  And so forth.  What is a quick mathematical way of saying that this is how the formula works?  Function notation.  I would simply say\nf(x) = 52x\nThe ""f(x)"" means ""I have a function whose variable is x, and if you want to use the formula, then put your number in place of x in the following formula.""  All of that is packed into ""f(x).""\n\nAnd I can show the results as well:\nf(x) = 52x\nf(1) = 52(1) = 52\nf(2) = 52(2) = 104\nf(3) = 52(3) = 156\nAnd so forth.  That is all function notation is doing--it is giving us a quick way to show what variable to replace with values--and to show the results that are obtained when I do replace that variable with a value."

I know other black males that suffer from the same problem. The bumps never go away, only subside after antifungal treatment, nearly disappearing, but still visible under the skin. They possibly get inflamed under stressful conditions. I've had this problem for nearly 6 years now. I have short hair and wash it twice daily. Heeeeeeeeeeeelp.
It could be cysts that are from much earlier pimples that are sealed off and have no pore opening.  A Dermatologist (skin doctor) can inject them if they are large and they will go away.  Could also be ingrown hairs or hairs that have migrated into the skin after a hair cut.  If you have health insurance call your regular doctor and they will refer you to a dermatologist sometimes over the phone and it will be covered.  Even if no health insurance it is less expensive that most health care.  Good luck!"
"how to translate patxi to spanish?

Depends what you are trying to achieve.  Patxi is a Basque personal name that is equivalent to Francis in English.  You therefore have four options:\n\n1. Leave it as ""Patxi"" - In many parts of the Spanish-speaking world and Spain in particular, they are used to Basque names and so this won't look odd.  Probably the best option.\n\n2. Change it to ""Pachi"", which captures the sound, but no longer looks like anything anyone would recognise.  Probably the worst option, but you might put this in brackets afterwards if you were unsure that the reader would know how to pronounce it.\n\n3. Change it to ""Francisco"", which is the Spanish equivalent name.  You could use this option if you are trying to ""hispanisize"" the name for some reason.\n\n4. Change it to ""Paco"" which is the Spanish short form of ""Francisco"" and looks a bit more like ""Patxi""."

"Is it as dark as night at the bottom of the ocean?

Yes, there is no light at the bottom of the ocean. Fish are extremely small, measureing about 3 to 6 inches and are bioluminecent - meaning they glow in the dark. For several reasons: Attracting food - other unsuspecting fish, or for mating. It is not easy finding a mate at the bottom of the ocean. The fish are small because food is scarce so potential for growth is naturally limited. The fish's eyes are usually large in proportion to the body size to allow the maximum amount of light in for vision, if they have eyes at all. There is snow, but not the kind you and I might know, it is called marine snow. It falls just like snow on land, and never stops. This consists mainly of tests, or shells, from dead marine organisms from the above waters, or organic matter. Organic matter is anything that contains carbon. The bottom of the ocean is a cool place. Have you heard of hydrothermal vents? They contain chemosynthetic organisms that obtain energy by breaking down inorganic chemicals. Humans rely on the sun for producing all of our energy. Well anyways I am rambling. But I like it.\n\nAlso remember at the bottom of the ocean there is pressure, much more than you feel at the surface of the earth. Thousands of pounds of pressure pushing in from all directions. Squish, squish."
"Is six figures still a good salary?

I would give a resounding ""YES!"".  If you are already currently earning such an amount, you may like to know there is a vast majority of hard-working, honest, and self-sacrificing people in this country who may never in their lives reach this stratospheric level of income, however hard they try.  Please live within your means if you have the fortune to be earning so much.  I would urge you to contribute actively to charities.  I have witnessed many, many pitiful cases of young and old who struggle so valiantly with less than $500 per month.  Thank you."
"a good business to start with 20k ?
is it enough to start a bussiness or not? and what kind of. I know it depends on me, but i want to get a clue.
Don't give up the day job. Start a second business in your spare time, such as selling things on eBay. Then when you've earnt more money, you'll be in a better position to start a business full-time. You'll also have some business experience, in researching what people want, what price to sell at, advertising, accounts and taxes, etc.\n\nThere are lots of people selling similar goods at similar prices. To maximize your profits, you need to put loads of effort into buying things cheaply for re-sale. For example, store closing-down sales, end-of-line clearance sales, last years model of something, goods imported straight from china, things that vary in price a lot during the year (such as christmas lights in January), etc. Second hand goods aren't much use, as you can't normally buy 100 of the same thing, and people prefer new stuff.\n\nOne business phrase that I remember is that 'You make money when you buy, not when you sell'. Your profit is the difference between the buying and selling price. Its better to buy cheaply than it is to spend loads of effort on selling things to people at high prices.\n\nYou could specialise in hard-to-obtain items, such as imported music, DVDs, books, fashion, artworks, etc.\n\nYou can get things made to order for you with your own design on it (such as t-shirts). This adds value to each item for very little cost.\n\nTalk to your friends and do research on the net to expand on these ideas."

"do you like that people judge you by the clothes you wear and not by your character?

You have to remember something:  People SEE you before they have a CHANCE to meet you.  Thus, what you wear sends a strong signal as to who you are, what you do, and the way you act.\nNow, if you are talking about the one day you wore sweats and a t-shirt, fine.  You're ""dressing down.""\nHowever, if you are talking about the girl who dyes her hair black, powders her face white, wears cut fishnet stockings and a black vampress dress, that is a different story.  She is TRYING to get a reaction out of people.  She is forcing people to judge her.\n\nRemember also, we are animals.  We have instincts.  We have to judge INSTANTLY whether other people, animals, are a threat.  It is called ""survival instinct.""  Failure to possess this may well end up getting you killed someday (think New York City subway).  That some people trip this in others is natural."
"What point in the hiring stage is a background check performed?
I am currently working as a mechanical engineer. I interviewed with a company last October, but no position was available then, yet he said repeatedly he was very interested in me, etc.  I received a call from the director of the office that interviewed me this past Wed.  He said that he had a position available.  I talked to him two days ago and he said he is going to send me an offer letter via snail/email.  The thing is, I like to smoke pot once in a while to wind down. I don't during work, or when I have to drive.  I met up with a friend one Friday after work and got busted for possession and para. neither was mine.  All because I was in the car. Possession got dropped.  Got 90 day supervision for the paraphernalia. Both misdemeanors. Please spare me a lecture about how terrible pot is.  However, I haven't received an email or a letter with an offer.  You think he did a background check and it came up?  Any way I can tell? Or would he have done it in October when I interviewed?
You will get a background check when you have the job.  The misdemeanors are a very negative part of your background.  They are usually looking for major convictions.  If you were at a young age the time period may be considered"
"How can the universe be infinite if it's expanding?

That assumes the universe has an end, or side.  The currently held belief is that the univers is indeed expanding, but expanding into what we don't know.\n\nThink of it as a baloon.  Wek now that the baloon will expand if we put air into it, however we also know that the baloon has a a side that increases in diameter as the pressure inside of it's surface pushes out.\n\nIn that respect we can not think of the univers in the same way.  We have no finite proof that the unviers indeed has a side.  Therefore we are forced to assume that as the 'pressure' or 'increase of matter' within the KNOWN universe increases, the distances between the planets and stars increases, and therefore the univers must als increase.  \n\nIs there a medium in which we expand? We don't know.  Do we have sides? We don't know.  \n\nHowever to use the understanding of the question you asked:\n\n'How can the universe be infinite if it is expanding' puts one of those theoris at bay (it assumes we have a side.) The act of expansion isn't finite, in fact, it is infinite in it's ability to change the shape, mass, and density of an object.\n\nSimply because the objct pops doesn't mean that the expansion has stopped.  Ever look at what happens to an ameoba when it is filled with water?  The single cell wil expand until it can handle no more pressure and then will pop, however as more and more water is pumped in, even after being burst, the parts will continue to get farther and farther away.\n\nUsing that same analogy, we can look at the universe.  We do not know if we have defined sides, so if we go with that predelection, then w can say that our expansion is finite, ie eventually we will not be able to expand to accomodate the limitations of the sides.\n\nIf we, however, assume that the universe has no side, we can assume that the limitations for that type of expansion do not exist. We will forever expand."

Depends on how much you drink daily. I know where I live there are outpatient therapies. And do not listen to whoever said that it is not an addiction, it most certainly is. If you are a heavy drinker, then you will need medical supervision to help with the effects of coming off the alcohol. I applaud you for wanting to quit. It is very hard, but definitely do-able.

"Panic Attacks Help?
Help my husband has panic attacks we have lost just about everything we have tried doctors, counselors, hypnotheripist, and self help books. I am goin crazy. I do so much by myself or with my 2 yr old. anyone have any suggestions for me
*Causes:\nPanic disorder has been found to run in families, and this may mean that inheritance plays a strong role in determining who will get it. However, many people who have no family history of the disorder develop it.\n\nHeredity, other biological factors, stressful life events, and thinking in a way that exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are all believed to play a role in the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, a major life stress, or certain medications. Some people who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. PTSD patients also show a much higher rate of Panic Disorder than the general population. The exact cause or causes of panic disorder are unknown and are the subject of intense scientific investigation.\n\nStudies in animals and humans have focused on pinpointing the specific brain areas involved in anxiety disorders such as panic disorder. Fear, an emotion that evolved to deal with danger, causes an automatic, rapid protective response that occurs without the need for conscious thought. It has been found that the body's fear response is coordinated by a small but complicated structure deep inside the brain called the amygdala.\n\nHypoglycemia may also cause panic attacks. In this condition the receptors for insulin do not respond properly to insulin, interfering with the transport of glucose across the membranes of cells. The brain depends on a steady supply of glucose — its only source of energy. When there is a sudden fall in blood sugar levels the brain sends a hormonal signal to the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline. This hormone functions to raise blood sugar levels by converting glycogen into glucose, thus preventing brain starvation, but it is also a panic hormone that is responsible for attacks of fear. The non-drug treatment for this is the adoption of the hypoglycemic diet. [3]\n\n*Treatment:\nPanic disorder is real and potentially disabling, but it can be controlled with specific treatments. Because of the disturbing symptoms that accompany panic disorder, it may be mistaken for heart disease or some other life-threatening medical illness. This misconception often aggravates or triggers future attacks in the uninformed. People frequently go to hospital emergency rooms when they are having a panic attack, and extensive medical tests may be performed to rule out these other conditions.\n\nTreatment for panic disorder includes medications and a type of psychotherapy known as cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches people about the nature of panic attacks, the cycles of negative thoughts, and demonstrated ways to interrupt the panic process.\n\nMedications can be used to break the psychological connection between a specific phobia and panic attacks, reducing future panic attacks. Medications can include antidepressants (SSRI's, MAOI's, etc.) taken every day, or anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, e.g. -- Valium, Ativan, Xanax, etc.) during or in anticipation of panic attacks. Exposure to the phobia trigger multiple times without a resulting panic attack (due to medication) can often break the phobia-panic pattern, allowing people to function around their phobia without the help of medications. However, for minor phobias that develop as a result of the panic attack, with early detection these can be eliminated without medication through monitored cognitive-behavioral therapy or simply by reinserting oneself into the phobic activity. The decision to participate in this therapy personally or through a registered practitioner should always be left to a medical professional.\n\nOften, a combination of psychotherapy and medications produces good results. Some improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time--about 6 to 8 weeks. Thus appropriate treatment by an experienced professional can prevent panic attacks or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequen"

"can we able to find the another solar system? if you know how, plz specify... have any plan???

yes we can, and actually astronomers have been working on it for the last 15 years or so, the problem is that there is no telescope currently powerful enough to directly see any planets orbiting other stars, the most common problem is that what little light is reflected by the planet gets easily lost in the glare of the stares light, so the only way that we can find out weather or not a star has planets orbiting around it, is by looking at the influence the planet has on the star, like causing it to wobble, this is because as a planet orbits around a star, it causes the star to slightly wobble with the orbit of the planet, and it is that slight wobble by which astronomers can estimate the mass and speed of rotation and many other details about the planet.\n\nnow if you are asking this to find out if there's any life out there, i would suggest reading this book called ""Faint Echoes, Distant Stars"" it will open up a whole new world of possibilities to you, here is a link to it\nhttp://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&isbn=0060750995&itm=4"

"Is global warming actually happening?

It is clear that we are in a period of Global Warming.  The average temperatures are rising.  That is a fact.\n\nIf you mean, are we suffering from a man-made global warming, that is a tougher question.  A lot of experts have debated this and disagree.  Here in Florida, we have had two really bad hurricane seasons in a row, and a lot of people are scared that this is because of ""Global Warming"" but the experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric agency are reporting record warm temperatures and at the same time are downplaying the man-made causes by saying there is no ""proof""\n\nAn interesting thing that may happen is that Europe may go through a mini ice age because of this warming.  There is an oceanic conveyor belt that helps distribute heat throughout the world.  This belt ends up in the Artic near Europe.  When the polar ice caps melt, there is an influx of fresh water that changes the salinity in the ocean up there.  This breaks that belt and so the warmth stays in the other portions of the globe.  There was a great special on this a couple of months ago on the History channel.\n\nI don't know if we are causing the Global Warming, but I do know that we are trashing our environment and we should be a lot better consumers so that our children and grand children will have a vibrant and healthy world to live in!"

Bone is composed of proteins (including mucoproteins) and inorganic material; minerals.\n\nBoth are being added to, and removed, as we go on living.\n\nIn some circumstances, there is not enough of the inorganic minerals present.  The protein scaffolding is not well filled - in with calcium and magnesium salts.

"Could cats have evolved from lemurs?
They kinda look like leumurs, especially their tails.
No, there are fairly major differences in their fine skeletal anatomy, especially their teeth that indicate that cats and lemurs evolved from completely different lineages of early mammals.\n\nThe primates (such as the lemurs) evolved from an insectivore lineage, and the earliest primates back in the Cretaceous would have looked rather similar to the modern tree shrew (Order Scandentia).\n\nThe carnivores evolved from condylarth stock (which also gave rise to the ungulates and the whales eventually), through early predators like Cimolestes, the cohort Ferae and from earlier Carnivores very similar to the Viverrids.  Modern civets and genets are probably most like the very early cats."

"if all the matter in the universe was contained in an infinite small point during the BB?
how was so much mass allowed to escape from that point.  (think black hole) that much mass should have been help in place or collapsed back in on itself by gravity.
The answer to your question lies with something called ""inflation."" The mechanics of inflation are very involved, but basically here's the gist of it: Long before the universe was even one second old it began to expand faster than the speed of light. Sounds like a violation of relativity, but it's not because at this point in the evolution of the universe there was no mass, only space-time which is not restricted by relativity. The bottom line is that with this FTL expansion rate, nothing could possibly pull the universe back into the initial singularity.\n\nFor a detailed look at inflation, check this website --> http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/John_Gribbin/cosmo.htm"
"Why does my nutsack hang so low? Is this normal for 26 y/o's to have 6 inch balls??

Some clarification is in order.  If your actual testicles are sick inches in diameter, get to a doctor immediately that would mean something else is going on.  If however, you are talking about your scrotum (ball sac) then you've got nothing to worry about.  Some of us just have really big ball sacs.  It can be a pain when you sit on them from time to time and briefs are the choice more often than boxers and unfortunately it makes your dick appear smaller because of the gargantuan sac underneath.  But all in all you should learn to enjoy it.  There is much pleasure to be derived from having a big ball sac. If it's really uncomfortable for you, there is a procedure to reduce the scrotal size.  But why would you want too?  I love mine.  And it gives you a great ""bulge"".  Enjoy your blessing."

She isnt that greedy Mom types ( well ofcourse no mom in the world is greedy and want good for their kid) but now my mom is jobless ( I mean not that bad but we have moved to a new place and she will be doing a small jobs for a while as she has to prepare for an exam to get a the same job she had previously, she was a pharmacy lecturer). I dont want her to get upset and study at this age. Can I try for engineering?
Depends on your academic record and abilities. Do you have the tenacity, confidence and brains for the studying and the career? To do well in Medicine, you really have to be passionately devoted to the field and vocation itself. You can't only be doing it for the money or some other secondary factor, because these won't help you when you're feeling the intense pressure and emotional strain. You have to be motivated by those you'll be able to help, by your future impact on society. There's much more to consider than just ""I want to spend money on my mother"". \n\nIt costs a lot to study Med. Think about how you'll get the financial support for tertiary education, which courses will be manageable both mentally and monetarily. Talk to careers advisers at your school, teachers who know your strengths and your personality. This is one of the most important decisions you'll make in your life, so enlist all the help you can from people who know you. Talk to universities, check out their course prerequisites and guidelines. Ask yourself whether you can meet all the requirements, whether you're willing to make the sacrifices necessary, and whether you'll truly be gratified by the life you'll commit yourself to. \n\nGood luck!"
"What unit of chain measure is equal to 75 feet?

As a unit of measurement within the Imperial system, the chain is defined as 22 yards, 66 feet, or 4 rods. Ten chains made one furlong, and 8 furlongs to a mile means there are 80 chains to a mile. In metric units, a chain equals 20.1168 metres. A chain is divided into 100 links. \n\n\n75 / 66 = 1.13636364 chain"
"What are the side effect of melatonin?

Melatonin is practically nontoxic and exhibits almost no toxic side effects, except for the occurrence of somnolence in most of the population at higher doses. Exogenous melatonin normally does not affect the endogenous melatonin profile in the short or medium-term. However, melatonin taken in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can lead to overdose because MAOIs inhibit the breakdown of melatonin by the body.\n\nIndividuals who experience orthostatic intolerance, a cardiovascular condition that results in reduced blood pressure and blood flow to the brain when a person stands, may experience a worsening of symptoms when taking melatonins supplements, a study at Penn State College of Medicine's Milton S. Hershey Medical Center suggests. Melatonin can exacerbate the symptoms by reducing nerve activity in those who experience the condition, the study found. \n\nMelatonin has been associated with a worsening of autoimmune disorders, and its use by those suffering multiple sclerosis is controversial, according to a University of Maryland Medical Center advisory reviewed by ADAM, an American Accreditation HealthCare Commission accredited publication editied by Harvey Simon, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School who practices at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAn Andrews University Nutrition Department report classifies melatonin among nutritional suppliments sometimes promoted beyond their proven efficacy, though information from a company that sells melatonin says theoretical studies suggest may help those suffering multiple sclerosis. \n\nAndrews University Nutrition Department report states that over-the-counter doses of Melatonin can cause severe headaches, mental impairment, and mood changes. Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D. Mt. Sinai School of Medicine cites studies from Massechussets Institute of Technology that say melatonin pills sold as supplements contain three to 10 times amount needed to produce the desirable physiologic nocturnal blood melatonin level for enhancement of nighttime rest. It is at those elevated levels produced by typical over-the-counter dosage units that studies have found mental impairment and headaches result, Herbert wrote in Nutrition Today article subtitled ""Harms from a pseudo-cure-all.\n\nMelatonin also has antithyroidal properties that can be either helpful or harmful depending on the condition and needs of an individual, Herbert wrote. Gonad suppressive qualities Herbert cites in National Institute of Mental Health reports are consistent with zoological research that found that a single injection could reduce adrenal and gonadal activity in Mynah birds. Several other rek suggest the natural function of melatonin is to regulate seasonal breeding activities, but no consensus has been established among researchers when those effects are helpful or harmful in human therapeutic regimes."
"negative and positive?
ok! i will accept any oppinions. do you really know how homosexuals suffer from so much pain because most of the time ppl thinks that homo are sex maniac. yes i admit i am but somehow  were still hungered to have a person that will love us the way we are. I mean, the sexuality we want to love us and that is very rare at this point although you can see a lot us flirting anywhere but that is self-satisfaction, and then some ppl will hate us will discriminate us, feel disgusted being with us. Why? but i hope nobody from your family will suffer from this. just tell me if you reall know the way feel being gay?
I have positive feelings but I am not fully out yet, so not much hate thrown towards me yet.  I do want to find a guy to settle down with and but the ""play"" aspect of my life in the past"

"Beheading.... What really are they thinking ?
Now, this is troubling me. How one human being can behead another without any emotion or feelings? Is hatred that intense to resort to extremes? Does the good book allow this? or, are the followers interpret it to suit their own cause?\n\nI can try to understand a fit of rage - or circumstances that force one person to kill another (I do not condone that either) - but beheading? It is barbaric to say the least.
Upto early 20th century the dress of the traditional German Executioners or ""henkers"" were tail-coat and top hat, with white gloves\nin their hand. You can see an image of an 20th century German\nexecutioner in google image--keyword(das beil von wandsbek).\nwe know the mediaval dress was some kinda hood and gown.\nWhat was the traditional dress of Swedish,Danish and Norwegian\nexecutioners in the late 19th and early 20th century?  I am guessing.\nThey used judicial beheading in France till 1977. I think the Westerners  were much more interested in this gross kind of method.\nIn the history of the world the CHRISTIANS were the most fanatic and blood thirsty race.They killed(or are directly responsible) more human beings in last 100 years than others killed in last 1000 years. Think about the inquisition,witch hunting,drawing and quartering of people,massacres of catholics,huegnots,jews. Even the crusaders ate human flesh during their capture of Jerusalem. If their act is Christian then yes\nthose people who are beheading today(with the reason that their\nland have been occupied) are more justifiably doing the right thing.\nTIT FOR TAT."
"longevity..?
I was pondering, some people have expressed the notion that they want to live a longer life..\n   My question is since scientists have deciphed the Human genome, why has'nt  that same community,do the same research the individual traits in mammals/animals that humans might desire to have such as the longivity gene that a certain tortose posesses,or the running ability of a cheetah or the enormuse height of a giraffe.  I think this can be done.  Of course with the guidance of certain other gov agencies. we will not be playing a God here because these traits may be what someone wants. \n      Is this a possibility?  answer only if you have knowledge of the genome. and explian as to why this operative cannot be carried out.
I have enough knowledge of the genome to know that what you are pondering is currently considered unethical.  Genetic engineering is not a foolproof science by any means.  Any genetic manipulation of a plant or animal invariably results in unsuccessful specimens, i.e. plants or animals that can't even survive or are massively deformed.  \n\nTo do this to a tomato is considered a reasonable science experiment.  But when it comes to creating genetically deformed human beings it's a whole other story.  It would be tantamount to creating 1000's of Frankenstein's or elephant men in order to get one successful trait.\n\nPerhaps one day we will understand cloning and genetics well enough to do that.  But it is a long way off from where we are now.\n\n\n""The main moral objection to attempts at human cloning right now is that a child might be damaged by such an origination. Researchers have not been able to safely and reliably create non-human primates by cloning.\n\nIf there would come a day when the above safety objection was no more, the remaining ethical arguments against human cloning would be psychological (some would say, speculative) and religious (a sense that such originations violate God's will or the natural scheme of things).\n\nScience fiction and popular movies uniformly present human cloning as a terrible thing for the person originated this way and for society. It has been a great taboo to think or argue otherwise. Under some conditions, however, say, if a person was safely born with a genotype that he or she later endorsed, human cloning could be morally permissible."" - wikipedia"

Most Amish are trilingual. They speak a dialect of German called Pennsylvania Dutch at home; they use High German at their worship services; and they learn English at school. They speak English when they deal with anyone who is not Amish.\n\nMy Mennonite girlfriend, who was allowed to attend high school, did take French classes with me.  Old Order Amish, however, fight to keep their children out of public schools.  The Amish schools they attend only go through 8th grade and do not teach anything more than what is necessary to maintain their simple, family oriented lives."

"What do you do to heal an aching throat? Hot soup or cold ice cream? Whats better?

Never ice cream. I learned a while ago from my mom that sugar can actually aggravate a sore throat/growing cold. Sugar's the worst thing you can ingest when you're getting sick.\n\nI just had the beginnings of a sore throat several days ago. I took two pills which are a mixture of herbs called Echinacea and golden-seal root. It worked PERFECTLY. It's the best thing you can take to knock out that blooming cold. It will be gone the next day. Just head over to your local health-food store and pick up a bottle and it will work wonders.\n\nAlso, hot chicken soup (Jewish pennicilin) is excellent for a sore throat."
"Meridia or Zenical?  Do they work?
I am 260 and need to get down to 150.  I have tried NutraSystem - no lasting success and increased my activity.  I eat pretty decently as far as quality but too much quantity.  I also ALWAYS feel hungry - especially at night.  I wake up starving in the middle of the night.  Any suggestions to RX info or late night snacking?
I heard on my favorite afternoon talk show that some people are ""under tasters"" which makes you want to eat more.  The test was to pour one of those little ""pink"" sugar substitutes into a cup of water, drink it.  If it's bitter, you're an ""over taster"", if it tastes sweet, then you're an ""under taster"".  The suggestion by the DR on panel was to eat a few nuts (half a cup) about 30 minutes before your meal, eat slowly chewing your food very well and drink lots of water.  Of course exercises is also highly advised, though he said the best ""gym"" was the one u have at home.  Walk, cardio and weights.  Walk 30 minutes everyday, Cardio 4-5 times (if you're really overweight) and weights to tone.  The DR said that the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn.  \nGood luck."

A.3/8 of a mile\nB.1/2 of a mile\nC.3/4 of a mile\nD.4/4 of a mile
The distance travel is going to be 1/2 mile.   How far away are you are from the beginining of the first 1/4 mile could vary depending on how straight of a line you traveled and which angle you turned once you stopped but the maxium distance can not be greater than 1/2 mile (perfectly striaght line).  So C and D can not be correct.  A and B can be correct.  Being a perfectly straight road is not very possible then A is correct.  But if this is for your math class then most likely B is what the teacher is looking for."
"where can I find snowfall totals for a city for past years?
Looking for totals not averages.  Ideally it would allow look up by zip code.
The best place would be to contact the National Weather Service for the area you are studying.  They should have data on all weather patterns collected from weather stations all around the country.  Some weather stations have only local data.  \nYou could also check the weather almanac for the specific year you would like to research.  You can usually find precip totals for every year that records have been kept."

Someone mentioned a seal, the bottle I have has a seal that says Hoodia sourced from the African continent. I have read people have great results, although I know it depends on the persons individual make-up and along with diet and exercise. But has anyone here had a personal experience with it?
I have never tried it, but I asked a dietitian friend of mine about it awhile back. Apparently, the real hoodia that people grow and eat in South Africa does work. However, unless you bring it over from there yourself, you are getting a fake form of Hoodia that will do little or nothing for you. The reason is, real South African Hoodia is illegal to export from there and is monitored very carefully. Don't waste your money!!"
"A question about GOD?
This is a question about GOD, please read through!!\nRecently I watched a show on National Geographic about elephants, it said that 200 years ago elephants very rarely(if at all) were born without tusks. Because of man, they were pushed to the brink of extinction, when more and more started being born without tusks(which makes them useless to hunters). In the present their are certain areas of the world where 40% of all elaphants are born this way.This is evolution in front of our eyes. The question is: \nIs this just a coincidence of evolution, or is god intervening using evoluion as a means of protecting his/her creations? Whatcha think?
Well, this is really brilliant of you to read between the lines. I mean that there must have been thousands of people who heard about the tuskless elephants but never attributed or tried to attribute it to God. Of course God is aware of everything in this world coz nothing can take place withouthim doing it. OUr minds are so unqualified to understand everything going on around us in this universe. It is just like a 10 MHZ CPU trying to run windows XP.\nBy the way, I've a comment to say: you can't say about God (his/her) because God doens't belong to a certain sex."

You'll need to give the degree of dissociation of the acid CH3COOH. If it was a strong acid you have to used the formula \nMV/mv = 1   where M is molarity of NaOH,V is its volume\n            and m is molarity of CH3COOH, v is its volume\n\nActually the problem here is CH3COOH is a weak acid and it would not have dissociated fully, hence the above formula cannot be used."

"Restless Leg Syndrome link to dopamine?
I recently did a sleep study that led to a diagnosis of Restless Leg Syndrome. I was goven a drug called Ropinirole to treat it. Since, I have learnt that Ropinirole was originally formulated for treating Parkinsons, which is caused by a deficiency of dopamine. I know I don't have Parkinsons (thank heavens), but looking up the symptoms of a dopamine deficiency, a lot of bells rang for me. Depression, inabilty to make decisions, arthralia ( i used to have arthralia so bad I used to have to use a walking stick - at 23 years old!!), lethargy, reduced labido. It was amazing to see the similarity between these symptoms and what I go through. Could it be, that I have a dopamine deficiency? How seriouse is it if I do? I've got a patholgy test for it coming up (gotta pee in a bottle for 24 hours) and I don't know if I should be concerned or not.
I have been taking Sinement for 5 years for restless leg syndrome, its the same med as Ropinirole, but was okayed for treatment of Parkinson's, that is why they now use the name of Ropinirole for the use of RLS. I'm not sure about the deficiency of dopamine relationship to RLS ( i my self am not depressed, and do not have the other symptoms related to deficiency in dopamine, However, I do suffer migraines and I understand that lack of magnesium may be responsible for RLS and migraines. I only started taking 500mg of magnesium to see if the severity RLS and migraines lessen......i will give it a month. I would not worry over much about the lack of dopamine, wait for results and talk with your doctor. good luck"
"What should I charge to clean houses? I want to open a house cleaning business and have no idea where to start

My advice is for you to read more of the business, so you can determine what you think you want and can given your present resources. The book ""101 Best Businesses to Start"" estimates that first year potential earnings for this business can be $40,000, while startup expenses can be $5,000 or even lower. Industry experts, however, recommend raising $50,000 for a startup capital in order to be able to invest in heavy duty cleaning equipment and have more resources to spend in marketing the business.\n\nYou can start by reading the article ""Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business"" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm . The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips to help market your business:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for new houses. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the home (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the cleaning business. Tell your family and friends to refer you to their friends and others who are looking for someone to clean their homes.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a cleaning service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other home owners in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\nAs to what you can charge, I suggest you check what other home cleaning businesses are charging. You don't want to charge a fee too low you won't cover your expenses and time, while you don't want to overprice yourself out of the market. You can go to the yellow page directory, and start calling your competitors. Pretend you are a potential customer and ask for their rates - just make sure you don't sound too nosy or too technical that they would know that you are a competitor.\n\nFor more in-depth information about the business, we have compiled a list of books on the topic and you can either purchase the book or borrow them from your library. The list of recommended books on starting a cleaning business can be found at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/bookstore/homecleaning.htm\n\n- How to Start a Home-Based Housecleaning Business (Author: Melinda Morse)\n- Start and Run a Home Cleaning Business (Author: Susan Bewsey)\n- Commercial and Residential Cleaning Services: A Resource Guide to Developing and Maintaining Your Own Janitorial or Home Cleaning Business (Author: Walter Fenix)\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business"

"forclosure?
what happens in foreclosure
Foreclosure is the legal proceeding in which a bank or other secured creditor sells or repossesses a parcel of real property (immovable property) due to the owner's failure to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a ""mortgage"" or ""deed of trust"". Commonly, the violation of the mortgage is a default in payment of a promissory note, secured by a lien on the property. When the process is complete, it is typically said that ""the lender has foreclosed its mortgage or lien."""

"How is the first time at a gynaecologist?

It depends on what you are seeing the doc for.  If you are going in for a pap/pelvic exam they will do the standard blood pressure, pulse, respirations and maybe temp when the nurse takes you to the examining room.  She may ask if you can give a urine sample.  She will ask you about your periods such as are they regular, when was your last period, do have any discharge and other such questions.  She will then have you get undressed while she leave the room either from the waist down or totally undressed and give you either a gown to put on or a sheet to cover your lower body.  Once the doctor comes in they will ask a few questions and then have you lay down and put your feet up in the stirrups.  If doing a pap/pelvis they will insert a plastic speculum into your vagina to hold it open so they can visually see if things look ok ie: looks healthy no discharge or other problems.  They will then take a small wooden spatula type device and gently scrap a few of your cervical cells to place on a slide.  This does not hurt at all and if it does don't hesitate to let your doctor know that this was uncomfortable as it should not hurt.  They will then remove the speculum and insert a gloved finger while they press on your abdomen to be sure they don't feel any tumors or masses on your ovaries etc.  They may do a routine breast exam to check for any lumps or masses and that should be the end of the exam.  The doc will have you sit up and ask if you have any questions and you will be done.  If you are there for other reasons such as excessive discharge or STD testing then they will also do those things.  A pap/pelvic is NOT painful and if it is painful for you then tell your doctor so they can be aware of this.  Usually your regular doc takes care of your annual pelvic/pap but I am assuming this is what you are seeing  a GYN doc for."
"What is the difference between a MICROCONTROLLER and a PIC MICROCONTROLLER?

A PIC is a specific type of microcontroller made by Microchip in Arizona. These are very cheap and popular in high-volume applications. They also typically have very little RAM and ""banked"" memory -- you access memory in a page and have to switch pages to get to other regions of memory. Although this isn't unique to the PIC, the PIC seems to have more banking than most other microcontollers.\n\nAnother item common to the PIC family of processors it that it utilizes a Harvard architecture. The data memory is separate from the program memory (in fact, they aren't even the same bit width).\n\nMore info:\nhttp://tutor.al-williams.com\nhttp://www.piclist.com\nhttp://www.microchip.com"
"Which religion is the right one for you? (new version)?
I was raised as a Christian (Lutheran) but have many different views from many religions.  This quiz helped me pinpoint which religions my views most closely coincide with.  I found it to be very interesting and enlightening.  \nhttp://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907\n\nMy results:\nChristianity 71%\nBuddhism 63%\nPaganism 63%\nHinduism 50%\nIslam 38%\nAgnosticism 29%\nJudaism 29%\nAtheism 17%\nSatanism 13%
My results.  Another survey of this type, but with very different questions, told me that my beliefs are most in line with Hinduism. I had always thought that Hindus and Muslims have a lot of trouble agreeing with each other, hence: Pakistan. But this might explain why I so enjoyed a novel called The Life of Pi. The main character was raised Hindu, then added Christianity and Islam to his beliefs while remaining a Hindu.

"What is the bird flu exactly?
I mean,sure ive heard about it and everything.. But does anyone know what it does? What the symptoms are? How you get it? Ive been wondering about this for a while.
H5N1 is an avian influenza virus subtype. The H5N1 flu is what is commonly meant when speaking of ""bird flu"" or ""avian influenza"". It is a viral disease that causes illness in many species including humans and is a pandemic threat. Experts believe it might mutate into a form that transmits easily from person to person. If such a mutation occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype or could shift subtypes as did H2N2 when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.\n\nH5N1 is widespread in the bird population. It is very easy for birds to catch avian flu from each other. Most humans known to have become infected had a lot of physical contact with infected birds, or, rarely, an infected relative. While H5N1 is mutating into variations which infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variations can infect humans.\n\nA highly pathogenic variation of H5N1 is currently spreading across the world from areas where it is endemic. Migrating waterfowl (wild ducks, geese, and swans) carry H5N1, often without themselves becoming sick. [1][2] Avian flu is also spread through domestic poultry, both through movements of infected birds and poultry products, and the use of infected poultry manure as fertiliser or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl.\n\nH5N1 is currently endemic in birds in southeast Asia and is threatening to become endemic in birds everywhere else. Tens of millions of birds have died of H5N1 influenza and hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of to try to control the spread of the disease [2].\n\nNot all cases of human H5N1 infection are reported and consequently the exact mortality rate is unknown. Earlier historical flu pandemics, which were also believed to be of avian origin, had reportedly an average mortality rate of 2.5-5%. The current projected worst case scenario for a H5N1 pandemic is somewhere around 150 million human deaths directly due to H5N1 infection (or two to three percent of the world's human population). No one knows what the chances are for this worst case scenario.\n\n\nHow do people become infected with avian influenza viruses? \n\nMost cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from direct or close contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretions and excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from an ill person to another person has been reported very rarely, and transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person. During an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have direct or close contact with infected birds or with surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions and excretions from infected birds.   \n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of avian influenza in humans?\n\nSymptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which specific virus subtype and strain caused the infection.\n\nHow is avian influenza detected in humans? \nA laboratory test is needed to confirm avian influenza in humans. \n\nWhat are the implications of avian influenza to human health? \nTwo main risks for human health from avian influenza are 1) the risk of direct infection when the virus passes from the infected bird to humans, sometimes resulting in severe disease; and 2) the risk that the virus – if given enough opportunities – will change into a form that is highly infectious for humans and spreads easily from person to person. \n\nHow is avian influenza in humans treated? \nStudies done in laboratories sug"

"Could Egyptians have been Human But not earthlings?
If you look at the historical evidence it only takes common sense to see they were Humans but not Earthlings.\n\n \n\n1. Look at the Architectural evidence: every monument is like a Map.\n\n2. Look at the religious practices: They Worshiped a god that promised to return. \n\n3. Look at the philosophical understandings: They understood Science & Mathmatics too well.\n\n \n\nIt all point to beyond this world, not beyond this life.\n\n \n\n*There is a difference. \n\n \n\nBeyond this world means, to travel away from here.\n\nBeyond this life means, to go into the spiritual existence.\n\n \n\nIt's pretty clear that they undstood their ancestry and prepared to return home, they stored all of their Material belongings. Whoever they expected to return, obviously has the ability to restore life to the body ,such may be the true meaning of reincarnation. \n\n \n\nIncarnation: a particular physical form or state \n\n \n\nThey buried themselves in the best formula of preservatives. Why?
well lets look at your arguments\n1\nhmm every monument is like a map? umm you have been reading too many sci fi novels and watching too many cheap tv shows. Think about this, most modern cities have their streets and avenues lined up north south and east west. Does this mean that the cities are a map to something? or is this just an easy way adc convienient way to plot out new subdivisions and roads?\ndoes this mean that the north south roads point to the north star, does it mean we are pointing to something in space? no it just means that it is easier for the surveyors to map things. \n\n2\nthey worshipped a god that promised to return?\nhave you ever ever looked into any other religion?\nhow about christianity, jesus said he would return. does that make christians from outer space?\nKing arthur was said to return, does that make the knights of england some sort of beings from another world?\nhindus and sikhs believe they will be reincarnated, and thus return, does this mean they were from another planet?\nNO, this is a basic premise in almost every religion, so why does it imply the egyptians were somehow special, if anything it means they were just the same as every other religion. in otherwords, normal people.\n\n3\nPhilosophical, math and science.\nWell I would have to argue that the ancient greeks were way ahead of the egyptians in philisophical studies. as for math and science well, the egyptians were good at math, but many many ancient civilizations were. The fact that the egyptians thrived for so long, just meant that they were better able to perfect the math.\nBut consider this, the egyptians had no concept of the number zero. and this is what limited their math abilities in the end.\nThey had progressed as far as they could. but without the number zero to add to their equations they limited themselves and could no progress any farther. They could solve quatdratic equations as most high school students can, but could not solve derivative and calculus problems without zero.(does this sound like an advanced race from space?)\n\nhow about time. the egyptians had a 22 hour clock, 10 daylight hours, 10 night and 1 hour at dusk and dawn. However the hours changed length depending on the seasons. so a summer daylight hour would be longer than a winter daylight hour. They has no way to measure time in a consistent manner all year round (does this sound advanced to you?)\n\nNow what about building materials. the egyptians used stones mud and straw. all materials which were plentiful in that area. but for a race that ""supposedly"" came from another planet why would they not mine metals or use plastics like we do. why did they not use cement (as they did have the materials for that)\nIt seems to me that beings from another world would want to use something better than sticks and stones. Know what I mean?\n\nnow for your last point why did they use the best preservatives on their bodies? well duh cuz their religion said they would return. In much the same way churches now enbalm the bodies of saints, because they too believe they will return. Does this mean it has to do with people from outer space? nope. seems too much like the same things other religions do. Think about the chinese emperors, they buried themselves with thousands of statues of warriors that they believed would come to life. Does this make them from another world?\n\nthe answer to all these is no.\n\nSure some ancient cultures advanced to almost modern levels of technology, however they never got as far as we are now. and the fact that many of these civilizations would rise and fall only to be replaced. shows that there is no evidence for a need of adding alien worlds to the equation, rather it is just a normal cycle of human and earth bound civilization.\n\nnothing in your arguments points to other worlds. sorry but it doesn't. I know it would be nice to think that, but your evidence does not support it in the least."

Ahh, good question. To know the answer, you need to understand that Jesus was speaking in ""wedding terms"" since we are His bride and He is the bridegroom. \nIn that culture, the bridegroom would prepare the wedding chamber on the side of the father's house (I go to prepare a place for you). The son keeps building and building until the father looks at the house and says, ""OK, son, go get your bride."" With great excitment, the bridegroom goes running off to arrive where his bride is patiently waiting. It could be morning, it could be night... she doesn't know. Then he comes in and wisks her away to the marriage ceremony (behold I come at an hour you do not know). The wife is caught up (rapture) in her arms and ""stolen"" in love from her family to be joined in a new family.\n\nThis is why Jesus said this and why the disciples did not question it. They knew exactly what He was talking about."

"i had fever and rash..my doctor told me that i have syphlis!  secondary stage..is it risky?

Get treatment FAST...read this:\n\nSecondary Syphilis\nThis stage usually begins 2 to 10 weeks after the chancre heals. Syphilis bacteria enter the blood and spread through the body, causing many different symptoms, including rash (small red bumps), fever, headache, loss of appetite, weight loss, sore throat, muscle aches, joint pain, a generally ill feeling, and enlarged lymph nodes. The rash of secondary syphilis, which is the primary way that the disease is transmitted between people at that stage, is unique because it can appear on the palms and on the soles. Gray or white wart-like patches of skin called condylomata lata can appear on the moist areas around the anus and vagina. In this stage, syphilis may affect the liver, kidneys, and eyes or cause meningitis. The symptoms of secondary syphilis will eventually go away. But without treatment, the infection will advance to the next stage, tertiary syphilis.\n\nLate (Tertiary) Syphilis\nAfter the secondary stage, some people with syphilis progress to a latent stage where they have no more symptoms.

"Do mosquitoes have hearts?

Yes they do. In fact, all insects have hearts but they sure don't look like our big mammalian hearts. A mosquito's heart is a long, skinny, fragile tube that runs along its back, starting near the aNnus', to the chest cavity (the thorax). The tube actually extends to its head but only the abdomen part has muscles to contract and is called the heart.\nA bug's heart contracts (as ours does) to squeeze green (or colorless) blood forward through the heart from chamber to chamber toward the thorax. There the heart simplifies into a plain tube (the aorta) that carries the blood (called hemolymph) to the head. The blood sloshes around in the head, bathing the brain and organs. When each chamber of the heart relaxes, valves open and blood rushes into the heart from the body cavity — but not via blood vessels. \n\nThe blood circulates freely in the body cavity making direct contact with internal tissues and organs. It delivers nutrients, salts, and hormones and whisks away wastes with each heartbeat.\n\nAnuradha"
"Is there anything to use to hide burn holes in fabric in your car?
the drivers side and a new burn hole on the roof of the ceiling.
Yes, you can take a small piece of matching fabric from a hidden area(under a panel or the seat) chop the fabric into fine pieces, take masking tape and neatly mask off around the burn, lay down some glue(not too much)(if its burnt through you'll need to glue in a piece of fabric underneath as a backer) and lay the copped-up fabric down on top of the glue(you don't want to push it down or have it soak through) and let it dry, once dry take shears or razor and cut it flush to surrounding fabric. This is how a pro auto recon shop would do it, or you could just give them a call."
"When does spina Bifida affect people usually?

Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spine and occurs in 1 in 2,000 babies in the U.S. each year.  There are three forms of spina bifida: occulta, meningocele and myelomeningocele.  It is caused by a lack of folic acid in women who are pregnant.\n\nSpina bifida occulta is the least severe form of the defect while meylomeningocele is the most severe form of the defect, resulting in the baby being born paralyzed from the waist down depending on the location of the lesion.  Spina bifida requires surgery to close the lesion, usually two to three days after birth.  I was born with spina bifida, specifically myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida."
"why did the Demon say to the Prophet mahomet that Jesus wasn't the Son of God?
The Koran
This is a Free Country we will speak against Islam if we wanna and if anyone doesn't like it then such a person can go live in one of those Countries where the Koran is the Law.\n\nAnyways Allah is not Yahweh (Jehovah) at all, Allah is in fact satan, so henceforth a demon spoke to Muhammed and thus told Muhammed to claim Jesus was a great Prophet so that while the status of Christ was degraded down, one would be tricked into falling for Islam's lies on account of the idea that if Jesus is at least acknowledge as a Prophet then that makes the satanic religion of Islam look good in some people's eyes.\n\nBut I will not be fooled and if anyone wants to whine a prayer facing Mecca off the top of their lungs about my exercising my Freedom of Speech then be my guest."
"How do you safely remove wood ticks?

Remove the tick properly. Using sharp pointed tweezers, or specially made tick tweezers, grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible, as close to its embedded mouthparts as you can. If you squeeze the body or head, you risk compressing the guts and salivary glands and expelling even more organisms through their mouth into your body.  \n\nDo not twist the tick or turn the tweezers as you pull out the tick. Pull out straight with a slow, steady motion. Twisting may force more organisms into your body, and may result in the head or more of the mouthparts being left in your body.\n\nDo not apply any substances to the tick before removing it - no alcohol or nail polish, no petroleum jelly or other ointments, and do not try to burn it out or otherwise convince to let go of you. It won't let go. It will just happily keep on sucking your blood and pumping pathogens into you.\nSave the tick or any nymphs or larvae that you find on you. Store them in a clean glass jar or film container, tightly lidded and labeled with the date you pulled the tick off you and the location you were when you acquired the tick. \n\nIdeally, you should have the tick tested right away to see what it contains. Ixodes pacificus is currently the only western tick associated with Babesia, Bartonella, Borrelia and Ehrlichia, but other ticks, such as the Dermacentor variabilis (American Dog tick) can carry pathogenic organisms causing diseases in humans and domestic pets (in this case, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia); Dermacentor andersonii is also a vector for RMSF. \n\nA good rule of thumb: have all ticks tested regardless of species. There is a fee associated with tick testing.\n\nTicks can be sent to \n\nIgeneX Inc.\n797 San Antonio Rd.\nPalo Alto, CA 94303 \n800.832 3200 \n\nor delivered to your county's public health laboratory:\n\nPublic Health Laboratory\n3313 Chanate Road\nSanta Rosa, CA 95404\n707-565-4711  Marin County HHS \nPublic Health Lab \n415- 499-6849\n Mendocino Public Health Lab\n501 Low Gap Road, Basement\nUkiah, CA 95482\n707-463-4145"

White Witches are good at heart, and do good for all...

"The US population is + or -300 million. Why is it that  just 20 million bird flu vaccines were made? Who gets?
Who will recieve the vaccine? Who decides? The Bird Flu is lethal.
Bird flu is not yet as bad as the media make it out to be; scaremongering sells newspapers.\n\nThere are only so many doses stockpiled because making flu vaccines is a tedious and time-consuming process, and viruses mutate quickly.  By the time 300 million does had been manufactured and administered, it would be a futile effort.  Also, there are storage and budget considerations.\n\n\nFlu shots are generally administered to heads of state and at-risk persons first; health personnel, the elderly, and those whose health would make flu a deadly risk, then the young, and then the general population.  Of course, government officials often jockey themselves ahead in the line, but that's not technically how it's supposed to work."

To be honest, I bet he does notice you and I'm sure he's completely aware of all you accomplish. You probably just come across not nearly as needy for attention as the ""apple polishers"" do. Your boss probably sees you as professional and down to business and allows you to keep in your rythm  without disruption. He probably has no clue you need some assurance. In the business world, I've noticed that pats on the backs don't come as often as they probably should. I'm sure if you keep up the hard work at the pace where you perform now, you'll get your kudos in the form of a raise or promotion.

"How bad really are long term affects of bankruptcy?  Anyone with experience of this?  How many years are you?
subject to the high interest rates on credit cars, loans, etc.?  How long does it take you to rectify things by paying bills on time?  Is it worth it??
For the amount of time it would take to work your way to pay off your bills for bankruptcy, you would be better off paying your bills.  Bankruptcy is like going to jail -- it's on your record, basically, forever.  Ten years is when it is removed from your credit report, but you will find even on job applications questions like ""Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?""  It is considered an irresponsible act, and affects ALL aspects of your life.  Much, much better to work out a payment plan, pay it off, and be done with it.   A lot can happen in ten years, and you do not want that mark on your record in case you want a new car, a house, a better job, etc.  Even in relationships, people often don't want to be involved with someone who declared bankruptcy because it shows an irresponsible person. Get credit counseling -- they can help lower payments or help send the payments for you.  If you overspend, then get some psychological counseling and find out why -- bankruptcy really is like a jail term....be forewarned."

"When will we be able to view , a new come, and will it be as bright as Hale bopp ???

There are several comets every year that are visible in binoculars or a small telescope. The recent passage of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann was particularly interesting because the comet broke into pieces. \n\nAbout the only bright comet in a regular, predictable orbit is Halley, and it won't be back for another fifty years. Comets like Hale-Bopp are rare, coming along maybe every twenty years on average. These large bright comets pass through our solar system after getting kicked out of the Oort cloud by some gravitational disturbance.  The Oort cloud is a huge spherical cloud of cometary bodies that surrounds the sun at a distance of about a light year. It is too far away to be observable, so we have no idea when the next big comet will come. Hale-Bopp was discovered twenty months out, so you could get plenty of advance notice. However, other, smaller comets sometimes put on a spectacular display on short notice, if they pass very close to the Earth.\n\nThere are links below to some comet observation sites. You will see that there are always comets around, but most of them are strictly telescopic objects."
"What diet works the best to drop 20 lbs within 5 months?

It's only 1 pound per week that you have to focus on.\n\nFirst find out how many calories you burn on a daily basis through your BMR and AMR calculation. \n\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/healthtool...\n\nThat gives you a starting point based on how many calories you should eat a day to lose weight. Combine a good diet, lean meats, no carbs after 6pm, only complex carbs before 6pm, plenty of veggies with a diligent exercise regimen of strength conditioning and aerobic exercise (at least 3-4 times per week) and you have your answer. \n\nTrack you progress daily or weekly to ensure you are losing at least 1 pound per week.  If you're not, increase your physical activity levels to 5-6 times per week and make sure your diet is clean, including no packaged, canned or preserved foods.\n\nThis however takes an incredible amount discipline. I suggest seeking a qualified strength and conditioning specialist in your area to meet your goals."

"What killed all the dinosaurs?  Why did it happen?
The answers ""ME!"" and ""Because you touch yourself at night"" are not valid answers.\nScientific answers only.
Wikipedia has an excellent article on this.  According to them, there are 3 main theories:\n\n1. Asteroid collision\n\nBasically a huge rock hit our planet causing a plum of sediment to float into our atmosphere reducing light from the sun.  This reduction killed off a huge portion of the existing plant life, thus wiping out the food supply for many animals.  As one thing leads to another, massive extinctions followed.\n\n2. The Oort cloud\n\nSimilar to the asteroid theory, an Oort cloud is a literal storm of comets.  The results follow pretty closely with the single asteroid theory.\n\n3. Environment changes\n\nThis is a little more vague, but also a little simpler to prove to a degree (pun intended).  The theory follows the notion of the magnetic poles flipping (causing tremendous weather changes), or some other massive event (such as the melting of the caps, or an ice age) that would in turn kill off most of the larger species on the planet.\n\nFor further information, please read the wikipedia article."

"Do we Control our Destiny.....or is it Fate?

We do not control our destiny... but we can if we really want to!\n\n\nThe destiny of a human being is fixed or variable. Can the control of destiny be exercised by one! Is it possible for a normal human being to take complete control of his destiny? Is it possible to manifest destiny?\n\nYes! It is possible to manifest destiny if you are able to understand the crux of life. The destiny of every human being rests with one. It is like a chest of gold the key of which is not immediately made available to us. Only having passed certain standards in life would the key become available to us?\n\nTo be able to manifest our own destiny there are some requisites fulfilling which one shall be able to manifest his own destiny? The moment one enters the domain of human life... the highest manifest stage in the cosmic life... one can reach the stage of enlightenment and finally salvation. Before that we need to take control of our destiny in totality. How?\n\n\nBefore we indulge further in the matter of destiny... we need to understand the reality of life!\n\nThe garb of a human being has been taken by our soul atman within. It is not vice versa. It is not within the competence of a body to inherit a soul atman within. That is just not possible. Our soul atman within has taken the body to purify itself of all the impurities contained within. Unless and until our soul atman is devoid of all the dross within... it can never become enlightened and gain salvation.\n\nThe goal of life belongs to our soul atman within. The body only does its bidding! It is only when the body sublimates itself entirely at the disposal of the atman soul within... can the body manifest destiny. The ego of the body has to be merged with the larger ego... the ego of God Almighty. Unless the body completely surrenders its ego and merges with the larger whole... the body can never manifest destiny.\n\n\nHaving realized the truth of life... submerging our ego with that of Almighty God... one does manifest destiny for ever. It is at this point our soul atman becomes governing. The ego of a human being having merged completely with the desires of the soul atman within... the soul atman becomes free to reach its goal at the earliest.

"how do you get the tiny hole in an insulin needle?

Well, an insulin needle is no different than the needles used by nurses to give kids their tetanus shots. It is specifically known as a hypodermic needle. \n\nGo to this link for an explanation!http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/msyringe.html\n\nIn case you cannot reach this link, here is the text:\n\n""The key to syringe making is forming the hollow tube, or cannula. Processes to make small tubes and hollow needles are quite old, and almost always begin by forming a large tube. This large tube is formed by either rolling a sheet of metal into a tube and welding the seam, or by taking a solid billet of metal and boring a hole through the center while the metal is heated (creating ""seamless tubing"").\n\nThis large tube is softened by heating it (called annealing), then drawn through a tool called a die--which in this application of the word is essentially a hardened piece of metal with a small hole. As the tube is drawn through the die it both stretches, increasing the tube length, and shrinks, decreasing the tube diameter. The tube is passed through smaller and smaller dies, continuing to stretch in length and shrink in diameter, until the desired size is reached. The last drawing through the die is often done without heat, therefore cold-working the tube to increase its strength and hardness. Sometimes a stiff piece of wire or a mandrel is placed inside the tube to prevent the walls from collapsing while it is being drawn, but often the process relies on incredibly consistent steel quality and high-tolerance equipment to manufacture cannulae that meet the specifications.\n\nBecton Dickinson, one of the largest manufacturers of syringes in the world, says it makes syringes using 3/4-inch-wide stainless steel rolled and welded into a 1/4-inch diameter tube, then heated, drawn, and finally cold-drawn to its final size. Some of those sizes are pretty small. \n\nThe tubes are straightened, cut to the proper length, cleaned, and then the tip or bevel is cut onto the end. The piercing end of the bevel, right on the very tip, is called the lancet or as I like to call it, the ""&$#%@*""! Many different styles of lancet can be cut; which one is selected depends upon the application--to be blunt (no pun intended), what portion of your body it's designed to poke holes into. Contrary to popular belief, sharper is not always better--medical professionals rely on the slight resistance of the needle through the skin to ensure that it penetrates to the correct depth and doesn't go bouncing off a bone, into your brain, etc.\n\nAs to your last question, the simple answer is that the ""stuff"" is able to get through because it is small enough to get through. Needles certainly must be matched to the application--try pushing honey through a 32-gauge needle, and you're going to need a lot of force if you can do it at all. This is one of several reasons why most injectable drugs have a recommended needle and syringe size or size range.""\n\nI hope this helps!"
"when did medicine develop in ancient civilzation?

That's a pretty broad question, since there were so many different ancient civilizations. And so many different ideas about what constitutes medicine. \n\nSince the ancients hadn't invented the scientific method, a lot of what they did to treat illness wasn't very effective. Even the Greeks, who produced Hippocrates (the author of the oath that physicians still take), didn't have a clue as to what really caused illness - remember, no one even SAW a microbe until a few hundred years ago; and no one knew they caused disease until the 19th century.\n\nBut of course some kind of medical theory & practice goes back before recorded history. People assisted in delivering babies, splinted broken bones, made and used poultices out of all kinds of things, boiled and drank herbs (effectively or not). Presumably, they learned to control bleeding by staunching wounds, & maybe even applying tourniquets.\n\nOn the other hand, one can find out a lot about typical or at least possible ancient medical practices just by reading medical literature written before the middle of the 19th century. The way Western doctors treated disease in the 1700s wasn't very different, or more effective, than the kind of things they'd always been doing.\n\nIn terms of medicine, ancient civilization wasn't very long ago."

First, Coral Calcium may or may not be effective at regulating blood pressure but there is not a single shread of evidence to support its use.  Based on the database from the National Institute of Health (National Library of Medicine) which chronicals all of the scientific/medical articles produced over many years, yielded nothing when searching for ""Coral Calcium"" and ""Hypotension"" together.  It is irresponsible to suggest ancedotal information to treat a potentially serious condition.\n\nVasovagal syncope (sudden fainting) is caused by multiple factors of which low blood pressure is a result rather than a cause.  Additionally a slowing of heart rate and other physiological changes occur causing the low blood pressure and then the fainting.\n\nI did find one study that supported drinking a half liter of fluid (Circulation. 2002 Nov 26;106(22):2806-11) which significantly improved symptoms for most patients with positive tilt tests.  \n\nI also found that certain training techniques (Clinical Experimental Hypertension. 2003 Apr;25(3):191-8) can be performed to improve the condition (speak with your physician - physical therapists may be able to help).  \n\nFinally there is another study (Can J Cardiol. 2003 May;19(6):698-700) that shows that paced breathing can prevent vasovagal syncope induced by HUT (head-up tilt). This finding suggests that respiratory training could be useful to prevent vasovagal syncope (sudden fainting).  It appears that several techniques that do not require medication can be helpful for this condition.  \n\nGood luck."
"Looking for a new family practice doctor.  What is the difference between a DO and an MD?

Hi,\nBoth types of doctors can be just as qualified as the other.  Medical Doctors have what we think of as ""traditional"" American Medical Training whereas Doctors of Osteopathy are trained more to think about the whole patient, instead of focusing on one area or body part.  They take extra training in muscular-skeletal issues.  I put a link to explain more about D.O.'s; but like everything else, it depends on the doctor.  There are good and bad M.D.'s and good and bad D.O.'s.\n\nGood luck in finding a GREAT physician!"
"What stars are seen in the both the southern and northern hemisphere?

Stars close to the celestial equator will be visible for most of both of the northern and southern hemispheres. If you were actually at the two poles, the only stars in common would be those exactly at the celestial equator.\n\nFor example, the belt of the constellation of Orion is very close to the celestial equator, so is visible almost eveywhere on earth (at the correct time of year, that is)."
"What are the most active gay/lesbian/bi-sex orgs in the DC area?
Ones people can get involved with.  Thanks!
That totally depends on what kind of organization you're looking for.  DC has a huge and thriving gay community.

"Happy Easter! Who is celebrating easter? What is the special food your cooking? So,how is your celebration?...
How your celebrating Easter today?
Going to church for today. We did an Easter egg hunt earlier in the week with my two married sisters and their children. After three rounds of the children finding the eggs the adults hid, the fourth round was reversed, and adults had to find the (hard-boiled) eggs the children hid. It was hard! There's still one somewhere in the living room we couldn't find! Usually we celebrate Easter with reading part of the New Testament or Book of Mormon about Christ's death and resurrection. My little brother is 18 and too old for Easter baskets. My mom used to make ""bunny bread"" in the shape of a large bunny, or bunny rolls which included a little ""tail"" in the middle."

"What is with organized religion?
Why can't we all just follow the bible if we are all following GOD then how come we have so many diffrent religions with so many diffrent beleifs? Shouldn'w we all just keep the commandment that Jesus laid down at Mount Sinai? I am a Seventh Day Adventist and I am kinda getting fed up with church politics and church manuals! Why can't we just keep the sabbath like God said and leave the rest up to the bible which is GOD'S WORD what more do we really need????
Welcome to Life, dear Child! Politics and churches seem to go hand in hand too often. (""poli"" meaning  many; and ""tics"" blood sucking parasites. Often interspersed with governmental officials)\nI'm not quite familiar about Jesus and Mt. Sinai...Moses, yes, Jesus and the Beatitudes yes... but the two together?

It is highly unlikely your boyfreind is infected. If he had no open sores and no blood got into his system then he cannot have HIV. Please stop worrying about it. You're doing yourself far more harm worrying like this. Kiss your young man for me and good luck."

"Why do people still confuse global warming with the depletion of the ozone layer?
Global warming is due to CO2 emmisions into the atmosphere that serves as an insulator to absorp radiated heat from the earth's surface. The ozone (O3) is a whole different subject that has nothing to do with global warming, but why then do people still confuse the two?
global warming and ozone depletion is related. read this....\n\nGlobal Warming Can Increase Ozone Depletion\nScientist's are concerned that continued global warming will accelerate ozone destruction and increase stratospheric ozone depletion. Ozone depletion gets  worse when the stratosphere (where the ozone layer is), becomes colder.  Because global warming traps heat in the troposphere, less heat reaches the stratosphere which will make it colder.  Greenhouse gases act  like a blanket for the troposphere and make the stratosphere colder. In other words, global warming can make ozone depletion much worse right when it is supposed to begin its recovery during the next century.\n\ncheck the following link...it might help you!"
"what is the fastest way to loose a cold?

Some evidence has suggested that zinc might trim a day or two off of the usual 7-10 day course.  But essentially there is nothing you can do except treat the symptoms.  Hydration, decongestants, and analgesics can be helpful for symptoms.  Painful or excessive cough can be treated with anti-tussives, but if possible avoid using these, since cough is an effective way of cleaning your lungs and airways.  \n\nHelp prevent getting a cold when people around you are sick by washing your hands frequently, and never touching your face.  You may want to frequently clean off keyboards and other surfaces that other people use.\n\nIf you have a cold, be kind and wash your hands frequently,  do not cough or sneeze into the air or into your hands, and let people know that you have a cold so that they can take precautions.  If you have something worse than a common cold, avoid people alltogether and see a physician.\n\nFinally if you do catch someone's common cold--and you probably will--take comfort that you will never get THAT particular cold again, since you are building an immunity to it.  However, there will always be plenty of new strains coming along every year that you can catch."
"Will my fiance's debt effect me when we get married?
We plan on getting married this summer but I am concerned about his debts. If he files for bankruptcy will this effect my credit? I plan on keeping my last name because we need my credit to remain uneffected. (But I'm not even sure if that makes a difference).
Man do I disagree with most of this advice!\n\nFor starters, any debts that occured before you got married are not suddenly ""shared"" with you.  They are his debts.  The way it's going to effect you is if they (for example) try to repo the home or car.  If you are living there, you lose the home.  But what else did you expect?   It's his home, bought under his credit.  \n\nNow, if you come into this marriage with your home/car they can NOT touch it.  His name is not on the contracts, and in most states they can not place a lien on it unless his name is jointly on it.\n\nYour credit does remain uneffected.  Any property you own (unless in a community property state) is still yours and can't be touched by his creditors.  \n\nWhen I got married, my wife came with a lot of ""debt baggage"", and creditors were hounding her something terrible.  But I know the law!  I put an end to that harrassment, and they couldn't touch ANY of my property or hurt my credit at all.\n\nI spent the next 2 years rebuilding her credit by co-signing on credit cards and a car loan. Now her credit is better then mine!  \n\nI will suggest that he get the bankruptcy before you get married so you can get a fresh start as soon as possible."
"is it possible to how many damaged veins in the heart without a dicovering surgery?

I think you are asking if it is possible to know how many damaged veins in the heart without exploratory surgery.  Yes, except it would be about the coronary (heart) arteries, not veins.  The arteries are the size of fairly large veins, in fact, leg veins are used when bypass surgery is done to the coronary arteries.  To find out how many and how badly the arteries are damaged by calcium and plaque (cholesterol) build-up, an Angiogram can be done, consisting of a tiny camera at the end of very thin fine tubing inserted into an artery at the groin, and slowly moved up and into the heart arteries.  An Angiogram would be done only in the event of heart disease symptoms, because the procedure itself carries some risk."

"If a car going 55mph has an accident and there is a fly, flying around inside, How is the fly affected? Why?

Remember, momentum is affected by mass.  The fly's mass makes it easier to dissipate the inertia.  So it seems that the fly could crash into the front, but not likely. Of course, most people are worrying about other things at the time, so no specific measurements have been taken!  The air inside has mass also, so in effect the car and the air mass have become one unit, in which the fly is also a small part.  When it stops, it helps everything else stop."
"Does epilepsy affect studies?
A friend of mine who used to do averagely on her studies was recently diagnosed with epilepsy and suddenly doesn't do so well on her exams and she wonders if it's the disease of simply depression.
I had always known I had a form of epilepsy. My child has always known he has epilepsy. For someone who has just been diagnosed it might be a depressing thing?\nEpilepsy is a life threatening disease. I do remember a new drug I was put on when in middle school, early teens. I was so out of it that I quit taking the medication to my parents horror! It made me feel ""out of it"". School work is something that suffered at the time a great deal. I choose not to be on medication for this and do not have grand mals to much...My child is on medication two times a day for the last 8 years. I would like him to be medication free some day....\nYour friend has to deal with her diagnoses. She has to realize that ANY stress on the body (who doesn't have stress right?) can bring someone into a seizure. Depression being a huge stress on the body, which might bring on a seizure which sometimes puts one into the hospital......the cycle continues. \nPlease do not ever leave your friend!! This is a very lonely thing to have! People can not see on the outside anything is wrong, Therefore nothing is wrong with you right? People in society can be VERY cruel. This has been my experience. People who do not no any better do not realize people with seizures get tired, get edgy and get cranky. This is not something one means to do...\nPeople with depression tend to ""self medicate"" with alcohol or drugs. Being a epileptic this is a VERY big no no!! Social situations can be a no no. Athletics can be a no no. Depending on how sever her seizures are.\nI was in athletics as well as a very active youth with only a couple accidents. Tell her just to be careful!\nBe her friend! Learn yourself about seizures and what to do when your friend goes into one. This is a very scary thing for all epileptics, is when one goes into a seizure. I am told I should not be embarrassed when I go into one in public, but I still am. I am trying hard to let my youngest child who is 11 have a normal life. It is hard not to be very protective, and/or to protect him from my bad experiences, knowing in todays society more people no about seizures then the 60's-70's. \nGood luck and just asking this question for your friend tells me you are a keeper as far as a friend!"

THANKS!!\n\n\nIts called the sacred heart medical diet and its a 7 day eating plan thats supposed to allow you loose UP TO 17 pounds in 7 days they use it for heart patients that need to loose weight prior to surgery in hospitals.\n\nIts a soup that consists of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes\n3 plus large green onions\n1 large can of fat free beef broth\na pkg of lipton soup mix chicken noodle\n1 bunch of celery\n2 cans green beans\n2lbs carrots\n2 green peppers\nyou eat the soup WHENEVER YOUR HUNGRY throughout the 7 days according to the source the more you eat the more you loose as the soup burns more calories than it puts in you\n\nYou can only drink unsweetened juices skim milk and tea and crap but i only drink WATER anyway\n\nDay 1-you are to eat any fruit except bannanas (cantalopes and melons are recommended for low calories) and you only eat the soup and fruits all day.\n\nDay 2- All vegetables eat untill your stuffed with fresh raw cooked or canned veggies try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans and starchy veggies. eat veggies along with the soup and at dinner time eat ONE baked potato (NO FRUIT TODAY)\n\nday 3- eat all the soup fruits and veggies you want NO POTATO if you have eaten as above for three days and not cheated you should find that you have lost 5-7 pounds.\n\nDay 4- bannas and skim milk, eat at least 3 bannanas and drink as much skim milk as you can along with the soup.

I think you have the wrong recipe the one I read had cabbage. and not all that other stuff.\n\nOh ya there are also food that are called "" zero calorie"" foods.\nCelery, berries, apples etc ( google to find) that have the same concept."
"I haven't dated for many years. Is it proper to kiss on the first date? And does the lady expect to be kissed?

It's not improper to kiss on the first date, but you don't have to.  You sort of have to see how things go.  Sometimes a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek work just as well.  You'll sort of know what to do by how she acts when the date is over.  If she kind of hangs close to you and lingers when you start to say good-bye, that is a good sign she is hoping for a smooch!"

"what is zero air and wats the actually component?

Spectra Gases' ""Zero Air Generators"" are commonly used in conjunction with hydrogen generators to operate a flame ionization detector (FID). A Hydrogen generator provides fuel while a zero air generator provided hydrocarbon free air for combustion in the detector. The Spectra Gas Zero Air Generator has a catalytic combustor which is electrically heated to a very precise temperature. At this elevated temperature, all of the hydrocarbon molecules contained in the gas are converted by the catalyst to CO2  and  H2O, down to ppb level. Catalytic conversion is the only practical means to remove hydrocarbons, especially the low molecular hydrocarbons like methane, which cannot be trapped by any filters or chemical getters. \n\nFlow Rates from one (1) liter per minute to seventy five (75) liters per minute\nCurrent Gas Flow and Catalyst Temperature display\nOperating/Stand-by Switch\nParallel-run Option\nRemote Control and Alarm\nReducing hydrocarbons to better than 0.01 ppm"

"what is a positive charge, negative charge, and static electricity?
plz and thanks
Electric charge is a characteristic of subatomic particles, and is quantized. When expressed as a multiple of the so-called elementary charge e, electrons have a charge of −1. Protons have the opposite charge of +1. Quarks have a fractional charge of −1/3 or +2/3. The antiparticle equivalents of these have the opposite charge. There are other charged particles.\n\nThe electric charge of a macroscopic object is the sum of the electric charges of its constituent particles. Often, the net electric charge is zero, since naturally the number of electrons in every atom is equal to the number of the protons, so their charges cancel out. Situations in which the net charge is non-zero are often referred to as static electricity. Furthermore, even when the net charge is zero, it can be distributed non-uniformly (e.g., due to an external electric field), and then the material is said to be polarized, and the charge related to the polarization is known as bound charge (while the excess charge brought from outside is called free charge). \n\nAn ordered motion of charged particles in a particular direction (typically these are the electrons) is known as electric current."

People may not agree w/ the gay lifestyle, however if they got to really KNOW some gay people the ignorance surrounding their beliefs would be wiped out.  Gay people are just like straight people as far as I can tell.  Live and let live, why do people care about what others do in the bedroom?  Is it a sin?  Who are we to judge or care?

"Is there a study of the negative affects of neighbors on property values in a subdivision-boats in driveway?
I need documentation that trailers, boats, RVs, campers parked in the driveways of an estate-type neighborhood will have a negative effect on Property values as well as the curb appeal.
I have not ever heard of one but that is a good question. Surely it is not a sign of good taste."
"I really don't feel well. Should I call out of work?
I've felt horrible for the past two days (I have my period. Always really bad). Luckily I was off yesterday, but today I have work. \n\nI'm debating whether or not I should call in sick. I've worked there for almost two years and have called out three times (twice because I had no voice and couldn't speak. A big part of my job). That's compared to the other girls who call out at least once a month.\n\nI'm always afraid to call out because I think things will be out of control if I'm not there and then everyone will blame it on me. I always feel like I'm responsible for keeping everything together and under control. \n\nBy the way, I do not have another day off until next week. I don't get weekends off.
If you feel that bad, then call out. You aren't going to do anybody any good if you go in feeling like heck. Take the day off, stay in bed or curl up on the couch and watch a good movie. Have a bowl of soup and get some rest. Tomorrow you will feel better and can return to the grindstone."
"How do i lose 10lbs in 2 wks?

the main thing is to eat less calories than you spend(...)\neach 3500 calories equals 1 pound, the maximum healthy weight loss is 2 pounds per week, but if you have lots of extra weight to lose when you go on a good diet it is so much possible you lose more than 2 pounds per week.\ngo on a diet in which you eat enough amounts of carbs, fat and proteine based on your height and goal weight, take multivitamins daily, drink at least 64 ounces water daily (the more the better), exercise for at least one hour 4 days a week, drink lots and lots of green tea( I believe it helps a lot), try the ""K challenge""--->have K cereal(original or red berries) for two meals (the instruction is on the box).\n\ntake a look at my answer to this question--->\n""What is the best diet plan need to lose 30 pounds?""\nyou might find it helpful.\n\ngood luck with your weight loss."
"Can gravity, through instruments like pendulums, be used as a source of energy?

According to the theory of energy conservation, it is impossible to create energy from nothing, thus, the only way gravity can be used to add energy to a system is by increasing the kinetic energy of two objects by accelerating them towards each other, a trade off of potential energy for kinetic energy.  This energy is generally short lived, however, as the two objects eventually collide and the kinetic energy from movement become heat from impact.  \n\nThe only way you could effectively harness the energy of gravity, is to discover where objects will impact each other, and then place a generator there which can make use of the energy resulting from the collision of those 2 objects."
"If you threw a small pebble into the deepest point of the Pacific how long would it take to hit the bottom?

This is same question as ""a small stone is dropped from sky"". here instead of air there is water, but logic is same. Water resistance plays a major role. Before hitting the floor the pebble achieves the terminal velocity, then moves with constant speed towards the ocean floor. Weight of the stone does not play a role, but shape of the stone does for terminal velocity value. A spherical stone is less resistant that any other shape. [I am assuming it rotates randomly while travelling down, so not considering submarine shape:)].\n\nHow long is still an unanswered question, due to missing data."

"Do you know what Musk is and where does it come from?

True musk is from the musk-gland (scent glands) of a male Tibetan musk deer and is, chemically, muscone, (3-methylcyclopentadecanone).  It isnt part of the urinary system as such but is adjacent to it and, I think, imparts its odour to both faeces and urine. Yes, it contains pheromones which influences males and females of the same spedies smelling it.  A zoologist will tell you more, but what I can tell you is that it is used in many perfumes, (and, traditionally, some drinks in the Middle East).  Nowadays, perfumes often contain synthetic versions of it, of which there are three, which might be preferred by vegetarians or for ethical reasons, although I dont think they kill deer to get it...? Somebody reassure us, please.\nThe synthetic musks I can give you the chemical formulae of also, but I am sure you dont want to know except that it is interesting to see how elaborate these distictive scent molecules are."

"Oklahoma's renter's rights. Can they ask for more money after the lease is signed?
I recently moved to some apartments in tulsa, ok. i signed a lease stateing how much the first month would be pro-rated. They are now asking for the difference in a mistake that THEY made TWICE at two different calculations by two different people. I signed the lease that had the lower amount on it. They said i HAD to pay it. Do i really, since i signed the contract with the other price.
People can ask anything.  Whether you have to oblige them or not is another story.\nConsider whether or not it was a mistake.  Pay what you genuinely owe.  Do not take advantage of an honest mistake.  Do not let them use a mistake to take advantage of you.  Supposing that they made a mistake and that you do not legally owe because of the signed lease, it would be appropriate to go ahead and pay the difference.  That is courteousy and respect.  You expect them to be courteous and respectful.  Give them what what you owe and expect them to do like-wise."

"do ghosts exist?

I think the idea is really, really interesting. When I was younger, I read a LOT about ghosts and hauntings . And you can't prove that they don't exist because you can't prove a negative.\n\nHowever, as much as I would love for ghosts to exist, the more I know the more I realize that evidence for ghostly manifestations is probably explainable by non-ghostly, real, but ephemeral phenomena.\n\nFor example, I had a book on ghostly hauntings in England. There were more scent ""hauntings"" than any other type, meaning that you would experience the haunting by getting a whiff of pipe smoke or bacon. This can be explained by the fact that scents can be absorbed by porous materials such as wood and plaster. After they are absorbed, they will disappear until meteorological conditions, like high humidity, cause the scent to become airborne and be smellable again. Given a very porous wall and a long-standing habit like pipe-smoking and you can get whiffs of smoke for geneartions."

"If space is expanding, where is it going?

No. It is space itself that is expanding. The problem people have in thinking about this stuff is that it is tricky to think about curved space-time. But that is the level at which things must be thought to really understand what is going on.\n\nSo an analogy might be in order. Imagine you are at the north pole (the Big Bang). Time will be represented by the latitude down from the north pole and space will be represented by latitude lines. In this (very simplified!) model, space is one dimensional (a circle of latitude) and as time goes on (as we move down in latitude), space expands until we reach the equator and then contracts again until there is a Big Crunch at the south pole.\n\nSo now ask the question 'where is space expanding into?'. The answer is either meaningless or at best, answered by saying 'into the future'.\n\nThis analogy is actually very good except for a couple of points: The actual universe may not have a maximum spacial size (the equator) but may continue to expand forever; also, the size of space (the latitude lines) may actually be infinite in extent. The model has a finite universe with both a beginning and an end. The real universe may be infinite and have no Big Crunch.\n\nOne very good aspect of the model is that it clarifies a problem a lot of people have. There is no 'before the Big Bang' just as there is no 'north of the north pole'."

"whats trozan war?

Trojan war.\n\nThe Trojan War was a war waged, according to legend, against the city of Troy in Asia Minor by the armies of the Achaeans, following the kidnapping (or elopement) of Helen of Sparta by Paris of Troy. \n\nThe war is among the most important events in Greek mythology and was narrated in a cycle of epic poems of which only two, the Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer, survive intact. \n\nThe Iliad describes an episode late in this war, and the Odyssey describes the journey home of one of the Greek leaders, Odysseus. Other parts of the story, and different versions, were elaborated by later Greek poets, and by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid.\n\nAncient Greeks believed that the events Homer related were basically true. They believed that this war took place in the 13th or 12th century BC, and that Troy was located in the vicinity of the Dardanelles in what is now north-western Turkey. \n\nBy modern times both the war and the city were widely believed to be mythological. In 1870, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann excavated a site in this area which he believed to be the site of Troy, and at least some archaeologists agree. There remains no certain evidence that Homer's Troy ever existed, still less that any of the events of the Trojan War cycle ever took place. Many historians believe that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various stories of sieges and expeditions by the Greeks of the Bronze Age or Mycenean period, and do not describe actual events. Those who think that the stories of the Trojan War derive from a specific historical conflict usually date it to between 1300 BC and 1200 BC, usually preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes (1194 BC – 1184 BC) which roughly corresponds with the burning of Troy."

"what does P( either A or B) mean?... a probability question?

The basic equation of probability is P(A)= Limit(NA/N) as N approaches infinity. Where \nA is an event\nNA is the number of occurrence of event A over a population sample N \nN is the to total number of samples (N does not have to infinite but sufficiently large)\n\nFor example if a pole is taken  of a population size of 1000 people by asking them the same question and 400 of them answered with “No” then P(“Yes”)=600/1000 and P(“No”)=400/1000 \n\nAs soon as you asked a question and included “A or B” statement you have opened … No that is okay, just more info.\n\nWhen A and B are two independent events then the probability that events A and B both occur is: P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B).  The outcome of one toss of a coin is independent from your next toss. \n\nWhen A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of A or B is simply: \nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).\nThe outcome of one toss of a coin will yeld either heads (H) or tail (T) since both H and T are mutually exclusive.\n\nI hope that helps"

"as secondary growth proceeds in a dicot stem,the thickness of.................................................
a)both sapwood and heartwood remains the same\nb)both sapwood and heart wood increases\nc)heartwood increases\nd)sapwood increases
a) is correct.\nIn vascular plants, secondary growth or, perhaps more accurately, secondary thickening is the result of the activity of the vascular cambium. The latter is a meristem that divides off cells: the cells on the inside of the meristem (the adaxial side) will become secondary xylem, while the cells on the outside (the abaxial side) will become the secondary phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length, hence the phrase ""secondary thickening"". As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. If this is kept up over many years, this process produces wood.Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also may have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss."

"what has christmas tree to do with christmas? what is its history?

How it All Got Started\nLong before the advent of Christianity, plants and trees that remained green all year had a special meaning for people in the winter. Just as people today decorate their homes during the festive season with pine, spruce, and fir trees, ancient peoples hung evergreen boughs over their doors and windows. In many countries it was believed that evergreens would keep away witches, ghosts, evil spirits, and illness. \n\nIn the Northern hemisphere, the shortest day and longest night of the year falls on December 21 or December 22 and is called the winter solstice. Many ancient people believed that the sun was a god and that winter came every year because the sun god had become sick and weak. They celebrated the solstice because it meant that at last the sun god would begin to get well. Evergreen boughs reminded them of all the green plants that would grow again when the sun god was strong and summer would return. \n\nThe ancient Egyptians worshipped a god called Ra, who had the head of a hawk and wore the sun as a blazing disk in his crown. At the solstice, when Ra began to recover from the illness, the Egyptians filled their homes with green palm rushes which symbolized for them the triumph of life over death. \n\nEarly Romans marked the solstice with a feast called the Saturnalia in honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture. The Romans knew that the solstice meant that soon farms and orchards would be green and fruitful. To mark the occasion, they decorated their homes and temples with evergreen boughs.   \n \n   \n In Northern Europe the mysterious Druids, the priests of the ancient Celts, also decorated their temples with evergreen boughs as a symbol of everlasting life. The fierce Vikings in Scandinavia thought that evergreens were the special plant of the sun god, Balder. \n\nGermany is credited with starting the Christmas tree tradition as we now know it in the 16th century when devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes. Some built Christmas pyramids of wood and decorated them with evergreens and candles if wood was scarce. It is a widely held belief that Martin Luther, the 16th-century Protestant reformer, first added lighted candles to a tree. Walking toward his home one winter evening, composing a sermon, he was awed by the brilliance of stars twinkling amidst evergreens. To recapture the scene for his family, he erected a tree in the main room and wired its branches with lighted candles. \n\nMost 19th-century Americans found Christmas trees an oddity. The first record of one being on display was in the 1830s by the German settlers of Pennsylvania, although trees had been a tradition in many German homes much earlier. The Pennsylvania German settlements had community trees as early as 1747. But, as late as the 1840s Christmas trees were seen as pagan symbols and not accepted by most Americans. \n\nIt is not surprising that, like many other festive Christmas customs, the tree was adopted so late in America. To the New England Puritans, Christmas was sacred. The pilgrims's second governor, William Bradford, wrote that he tried hard to stamp out ""pagan mockery"" of the observance, penalizing any frivolity. The influential Oliver Cromwell preached against ""the heathen traditions"" of Christmas carols, decorated trees, and any joyful expression that desecrated ""that sacred event."" In 1659, the General Court of Massachusetts enacted a law making any observance of December 25 (other than a church service) a penal offense; people were fined for hanging decorations. That stern solemnity continued until the 19th century, when the influx of German and Irish immigrants undermined the Puritan legacy. \n\nIn 1846, the popular royals, Queen Victoria and her German Prince, Albert, were sketched in the Illustrated London News standing with their children around a Christmas tree.

No. Qualitative analysis of a compound requires access to lots of assorted chemicals (non-household, definitely), a lab, a centrifuge, and other lab equipment. You won't be able to do it at home, especially not with household chemicals. I'm assuming you don't have 18 M hydrochloric acid at home."
"What diet pill will help me lose 10 pounds over a period of 4 weeks? How can i do it myself ?

Diet pills are not the answer.  Typically they have caffeine, in one form of its metabolites or another, to make you feel full.  While you make think this is a miracle, it deprives your body of water, thus making it retain water, and because most people mistake thirst for hunger, they end up eating more.  The other person who answered this question mentioned slim-fast shakes for breakfast and lunch and a small dinner with no snacks.  I agree that meal replacement shakes are excellent, your body needs more than that to keep itself running properly.  So my recommendations follow.\n\n1.  10lbs is 4wks is the absolute maximum you should consider losing over such a short period of time.  If you lose more weight, you are probably 'crashing' your system (i.e. you are not getting nearly enough calories and are losing weight because your body is eating itself).\n\n2.  I agree with the meal replacement shakes, but you need to eat more than 3 meals per day if you are looking to lose weight, but keep a firm, tone look when you are done.  You should eat every three hours that you are awake.  The reason for this is if you eat only 3 meals/day, you are putting your body through mini-starvation periods (ex. noon-6:30pm).  This makes your body store fat more readily, to prepare for the next starvation.  By eating every three hours you typically a)eat less, and b)safely lose weight.  So long as you don't make every time you eat a meal, you'll do fine.\n\n3.  Exercise.  This is crucial.  To lose weight, you ought to do intense interval training.  Longer aerobic workouts burn calories, but only for the time you are exercising.  Interval workouts burn calories even after you are finished, but I won't lie, they are difficult.  I recommend a combination of springs/jumps/lunges/pushups/situps.  Do one of those for 20-30s, then jog for 90s and repeat.  Do four sets of four different exercises I've listed above, do them 3 days a week.  If you combine them with some basic weight training, you will see results in 4wks.\n\n4.  Read.  Read.  Read.  Get your hands on some literature that will advise you on the healthiest foods to eat (I am a devout follower of The Abs Diet).  Also read anything written by Alwyn Cosgrove and Mark Versteegen, these two guys know how to make people look better.\n\n5.  My list of sources has some great tricks and tips to getting and staying fit.  The gist of the abs diet can be obtained from men's health.\n\nFinally, good luck in your weight-loss pursuits!\n\nP.S.  Letting a friend know of your goal will really keep you motivated to hitting that goal, so get the word out!"
"How do I apply for a government grant with out buying a How to guide?

It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

my son is a drug addict and he has been diagnosed as bipolar. I want to know if the drug use could have caused the bipolar diagnosis.

you are not falling in love.   You are attracted to the familiar.   It is part of the human condition.   The same mechanisms that makes us able to adjust to our environment, no matter how trying or downright awful it may be, actually creates a pseudo-preference for that environment.  That mechanism is stronger in some people than others. it makes them adjust more easily. The people who most easily adjust, to new situations, most easily ""fall in love"" in their work environment.  It's where they spend the bulk of their time.\n  Whereas, people who are resistant to change rarely fall in love with their work environment.   \n\nGet a life! meet some new people.

Talk to your doctor.  You do NOT outgrow asthma.  It can, however, fade quietly into the background as you age and grow less reactive to the things that trigger your attacks.\n\nPeople that believe they ""outgrow"" their asthma are often extremely disappointed when they hit a life challenge (pregnancy, menopause, old-age) or have an extreme illness (pneumonia) and then all of a sudden the asthma they thought they'd ""outgrown"" returns (hormonal changes can re-trigger asthma as can illness).\n\nTake care!"

"what are worm holes and is there such a thing as a 4th or 5th dimension?
in other words is time travel possible? I mean wouln't there have to be some sort of gravitational feild disruption? and some sort of transport vheicle?
Scientist belive there are several dimesions.  Remember dimensions are based on measurement.  Length width height, 3 dimesions so we are in the third dimension.  A showdow for example only has length and width so it is the 2nd dimseion.  We cannot comprehend other demensions because we live in a 3d world where only LWH exist.  It is like asking your shadow what is tall, he would know because he lives in the 2nd demsiond.  So there are other dimensions yes and we can dicipher them though the wonders of mathmatics and physics.\n\nGravity works likes a bowling ball on a bed.  Think of the bed as the fabric of space.  If you put a tennis ball on the bed it would ""gravitate"" towards the bowling ball.  This is the theory of realtivity.  A worm hole forms when a really heavy mass punches through that space fabric.  If you had a million pound bowling ball it would go right though the bed.  The same things happens in space that heavy mass punches right though to the other side forming a worm hole."

Doctor has on the above for neuropathy, but in the process of adjusting lantus so sugars high in AM lower rest of day.  Sharp stabbing pains in feet.  Laying in bed getting out a few times a day, back, knees hurting from laying in bed for a month. Doctor really doesn't have any ideas on how to help relieve the pain and hoped someone out there had experinced this and found some ways to help relieve it.  He is taking Hydrocodine 500  mg about every 5 hours and it doesn't seem to help much. He is 19 years old and is a type 1 diabetic and doesn't make any insulin. On lantus 33 units 1xday and 8 units Novalog with meals and a sliding scale for sugar readings along with 8 units at each meal and other times when testing and sugar is high.\n\nMother, (me) going crazy from not knowing athing to do to help him. Work 4 days a week and get up every morning and fix his breakfast, go to work, spend the evening cooking and getting everything ready for the next day for myself  and him, exhausted.  :0)
First of all when a person is diabetic, using tight control of blood sugars will help a lot with neuropathy pain. If blood sugar is out of control, even a little, it makes the neuropathy a lot worse. \n\nMy Neurologist has me taking Cymbalta 60mg once a day and Lyrica 50mg three times a day. \nCymbalta helps with stabbing pain. \nLyrica with burning. \n\nCymbalta and Lyrica work very well together for peiripheral neuropathy. In my experience, narcotic type drugs like hydrocodone don't help this condition very much at all and are a waste of money.\n\nFor out of control pain, I soak my feet in icy cold water for about 20 minutes. that really helps when my feet burn really bad. I also ice pack them. If you don't have ice packs, a bag of frozen veggies work nicely. Distrtactions will sometimes help as well. Not passive things like TV, but something that will keep my mind busy enough to ignore the pain. It doesn't always work, but is worth a try. For stabbing pain, I try to massage the spot where the pain is. Sometimes it is so bad I fall. For me Cymbalta has really helped here.\n\nAnd even though it hurts, walking as much as I can even just up and down the block or around the house can help. (But it sometimes hurts like the dickens)\n\nNeuropathy is a miserable condition, and my best wishes go to both you and your son. It is hard to live with chronic pain, and hard to care for someone who has this condition. Bless you both."

He's overwieght at 4ft.10in. and 114 pound. So i don't know whats going on.Anyone out there with these same sytoms. He carrys alot of his weight around his belly, and has thick joints? he has a heavy set body type. and tires easliy?
IBS rarely causes weight loss.  I was diagnosed over 20 years ago, and believe me, I have fought my weight the entire time.  He desperately needs physical activity.  I find the more active I am and the more water I drink, the less my IBS bothers me.  He also needs to be eating high fiber foods, or take a fiber supplement.  he should avoid candy and high fat stuff like burgers and fries.  He also needs to avoid seeds, like sesame and sunflower.  Get him into soccer, or scate boarding, something that will keep him active and moving.  The fact that he carries most of his weight around his middle is setting him up for heart disease.  Men especially are dying in their twenties now from sudden cardiac arrest from obesity and lack of aerobic exercise.  Good luck to you."

"are there any side effects on  creatine because i tak it for improve my body>?

Nonsense, don't listen to anybody that has posted so far. Creatine is created naturally in your body and so it is merely used to supplement what is already in your system. If you are referring to ""Creating Monohydrate"" it is the original form of creatine and currently the least used by bodybuilders. Reason being, it bloats your body with water and your cells tend to absorb more water while on creatine monohydrate. It's not necessarily a bad look, but who wants to look bloated? The creatine that I have used in the past and been satisfied with is tri-creatine malate. The actual brand is SAN V12. On the sources I've posted a review of it. I wouldn't suggest any form of supplements for beginners until you  have at least been working out for 6 months- 1 year. What you can use after several months is whey protein: The fundamental of every diet. I've also posted a link for it. So there you have it, take creatine freely, but don't abuse it. Take it in 8 week cycles and give yourself about 2 weeks of rest in between."

im babysitting 3 and 5 yr old boys what are some fun games for them to play and keep busy or what can they do to keep busy i dont have any toys here and i never can think of anything fun for them to do so any ideas?help please thanks
Well, number one, don't watch T.V.! That is a bad thing to do when you babysit them. It makes them think it is okay to be a couch potato and then you become lazy, as well. Make your money worth it. Do something fun and creative with them. \nIf they have board games at their house try some easy ones. Like chutes and laders or something of the sort. \nOr make up a story. You start with something like ""once upon a time there was a boy named.."" then they have to finish the story and you take turns. \nMake up games that teach them life-long leasons! \nHope I gave you some idea starters. \nWishing you well (because I totaly understand what you are going through!) \n-PolarGirl8\nP.S. I am babysitting some boys tomorrow, and they are 3 and 5 as well! Ha,ha.\nP.P. S. If it is nice outside try playing a game similar to ""duck duck goose"" except it is called ""drip drip drop"". You use was bucket of water and drop water on their head and then drop the whole bucket of water on them. It is very fun!"
"Ways to increase bone density includes greater calcium intake?

Having the RDA of calcuim is a first step. Also calcium is more readily absorded in the presense of Vitamin D, so get a little bit of sun (10 - 15 minutes/day is sufficient). Finally do some weight bearing exercise. The training response will induce stronger bones, connective tissue, and muscles in the area targeted by the exercise."
"My 6 year old's teeth look bluish-whitish as the baby teeth are replaced. Anyone knows why this is?
Will it go away or should I take him to a dentist?
Kinda sounds like dentinogenesis imperfecta aka opalescnt dentin. The dentin is abnormal as a result of disturbances in the odontoblastic layer during deverlpment. The teeth appear trasclucent or opalescent  and vary in color from gray to bluish-brown. Go see your dentist."

"A curve in a highway has a radius of 120m and is banked at 2.50 degrees.?
On an icy road, what is the safest speed to around the curve
To stay on the road with no slip the vector of total force on a car F must be strictly normal to the bank with b=2.5 degrees. Vector F=Fx+Fy, Fy=m*g being the weight of the car, Fx=m*a=m*r*w^2 is centripetal force on the curve of r=120m, w=v/r is angular speed, v is linear speed, a=r*w^2 is centripetal acceleration. On the other hand as Fx=F*sin(b) & Fy=F*cos(b) or Fx/Fy=tg(b) or [m*r*(v/r)^2]/[m*g]=tg(b), hence v=sqrt(g*tg(b)*r)=7.17m/s=25.81 km/h. Hi to SS!"

"how many grams of   CH4   are needed to completely react with   96.00 g   of   O2 ?
CH4   +   O2   -->   CO2   +   H2O
The first thing you need to do is work out how many moles of oxygen you have. You do that by dividing 96 by the molecular mass of oxygen (which is 32). As it's 1:1 stoichiometry, you just take that nymber and multiply it by the molecular mass of methane. (that's 16)"

I saw this on a news cast one night.  They featured a story where the news employee approached people at random that were walking thru the mall.  They asked them if they had a credit card and would they want to lower their interest rates.  Well.....who wouldn't?  They simply called the credit card company and asked!!  Yep, it was that easy.

"Why do long wires provide more resistance than short wires?
Can anyone please tell me why long wires provie more resistance than short wires in as much scientific detail as possible? Ignoring thickness. I'm confused... is it because more electrons collide with more atoms, increasing the energy transfer form kinetic energy to thermal energy? S.O.S
The following is from Wikipedia:\n\n""In a normal conductor, an electrical current may be visualized as a fluid of electrons moving across a heavy ionic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the energy carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into heat (which is essentially the vibrational kinetic energy of the lattice ions.) As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance.""\n(See ""superconductor"")\n\nAs to length and disregarding superconductors, any unit length n of a material has the property of electrical resistance.  Since resistances in series add, a length 2n will have 2 times the resistance of a length n, etc.  Also see ""resistance"" in wikipedia, where rho is defined."
"How did I get a ringworm in my hair?
There's a small circular bald patch on the top part of my head and its not red, flaky, or itching, its not discolored at all. Its just a small, smooth bald spot
From an in depth ringworm information site, (link listed below in sources):\n\n""The fungus that causes ringworm is spread from one person to another. Sometimes this happens through direct contact. An infected person may touch someone who does not have the disease and directly transfer the fungus to the second person.\n\nAt other times, the fungus is transferred indirectly. For example, people with ringworm may leave the fungus on towels, hairbrushes, or other objects. A second person may then pick up the fungus while handling these objects.\n\nCertain conditions increase the risk of spreading the fungi (more than one fungus) that cause ringworm. These include dampness, humidity, and dirty, crowded living conditions.""\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that if you have any infected friends, family or animals, they may have transmitted it to you as simply as you touching or petting them on or near the infected area and then you running your hands through your hair!"
"philosophy of man by jacque rousseou?
about man
I think he was the one that said... ""I think, therefore I am."" He questioned everything like everyone does today and boiled down the one thing he could know... he was able to think and moved on from there. It is actually a very powerful statement to become self aware to the fact that we are thinking beings. Once we consider our own thoughts and how to control the path of our thinking, we are able to achieve monumental movements forward in our own personal development. It's like you take control of the bus you thought someone else was driving. \n\nThere is a joke that went like this...

"At 26 I I've been diagnosed with PCOS and I am very depressed about it. M not sure what medicine to take.?
Coz of my history with severe migrane attacks my doctor has advised me not use Metamorphin. I have been put on Aldactone. My biggest issue is increasing hair growth on my face, chest and stomach. I feel so ugly and low. I have started off with an exercise program and am careful about what I eat but I feel a lot LOST. A couple of days ago while browing the internet I came across this website http://pcos.insulitelabs.com/. I was wondering if anyone has used this product.
I was recently diagnosed as well.  I would only take medication that my doctor gave me.  Please be careful about what you take.  If you are trying to concieve, taking something dangerous will increase your risks of pregnancy loss, birth defects, etc.  Talk to your doctor about any questions you might have.  It is very important that you stay in close contact with him/her.  \nThe lost feeling does get better.

"Why is it wrong for me NOT to want to date out of my race?
I have been called racist over this.  What is wrong with being proud of my race...\n\n\n(And I did not mention my race so this in no way can be called racist)
I think this is a good question to bring up, as it has raised many different responses from others (especially those who did not read the question well and answered assuming the questioner was being racist by asking the question).\n\nI personally do not think you are wrong for NOT wanting to date out of your race.  Many people remain committed to continuing the binds that hold their race true and that is something to be proud of, isn't it?  It used to be.  Every race was happy to continue to lengthen their ethnicity so as not to die out as a race.  In time, it changed and wasn't so important, given social awareness and immigration to other countries.  Then, we saw there was nothing wrong with integration.  So the same should be for those who do not wish to date/marry out of their race.  I can't say that the person needs to have a biased reason, such as ""well, as long as you don't do it because you hate other races.""  Because you're the one who has to live your life.\n\nYou are not a racist just because you choose to do this.  I have been called names just because I dated OUT of my race.  When I was dating, had men of my race shown interest, I'd happily have dated them, but they stereotyped me and avoided me based on that ""probable"" information.  I married OUT of my race simply because I fell in love with him - mentally, the ""race"" thing just didn't register, so I did what I wanted to do.\n\nI am proud of my race and you should be too, as this is our heritage, who we are (good, bad or indifferent).\n\nFor those who misunderstood you, please don't feel bad.  Perhaps they misinterpreted the question - this happens.  Know that you should not feel obligated to date out of your race.  Who are we to say that you should, that this would help lighten racism as we know it?  It's your decision/life, not ours."

"I've used three or four prescriptions on what I thought was pink eye.?
My daughter and granddaughter had pink eye. They're over theirs. Mine won't go away!
First you need to make sure that you aren't using anything that's contaminated - this includes make up (throw it away), towels, sheets, and pillows (wash them).  The majority of cases of pink eye resolve on their own within 4 weeks (as long as you aren't re-infecting yourself).  If it lasts longer than that, you absolutely need to see your eye doctor to rule out other infectious and non-infectious causes.  You also should never self-medicate (especially with other people's prescriptions).  Even eye drops can cause serious side effects in certain people."
"Questions on SEXUAL HARASSMENT in the workplace?
Alright, I would appreciate any info about sexual harassment in the workplace.  If a manager pressures a female worker to have sex or perform a sexual act on him, and she unwillingly complies, is that considered sexual harassment?  If the owner does nothing about it when she tells him what happened, should he face a lawsuit?  Is it best to quit the job, or try to get fired?  The reason I ask is because this legal person said it is to the woman's advantage if she's fired if she wants to pursue legal action.  \n\nPlease, anyone with info or experience, please share!  If you'd like to e-mail me or I.M. me, feel free (check my profile for my yahoo I.D.)  The manager has been known to get touchy with a few others as well, but not in the way I'm talking about.  There is also racism and unfairness going on at this job.  Thanks in advance for any help.
i don't have experience (i'm only 12) but yes it is sexual harrassment. yeah he should face a lawsuit. it's best to quit the job...actually scratch that....u should definitly quit the job if there is sexual harrassment of any kind or racism and unfairness. good luck!"

When you stand up too fast you have a sudden drop in blood pressure which can cause you to be light headed.  It can happen to anyone.  Have your blood pressure checked next time you are at the doctor just in case.  Another possibility is that it may be blood sugar related.  If it has been a long day and you haven't eaten dinner yet your body could just need equilibrium.  Or a combo of the 2.  Ask your doctor if you are really concerned about it.\nTake care."

Find the axis of symmetry. y = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\ncan you show the work because i am trying to learn how to do this the right way.
Get your formula into this format:\n\ny = (x+a)²\n\nWhen it's in this format, it's easy to get the axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is the line x = -a.  (This is also the value (x=-a) that will give you the vertex of your parabola.  The vertex and line of symmetry are related, because the vertex always goes through the line of symmetry.)\n\nSo since you have y = (x+2) ² your axis of symmetry is the line x = -2.\n\nHope that helped!\n\n~ ♥ ~"

Does anyone have any wise words, or expirience?  I'm so scared that I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
My daughter just had spinal surgery for Scoliosis (March 15th) and she felt the same way.  She cried, started staying in her room, didn't want to eat.  But we kept talking her through it.  I don't know what kind you're having, but if it's the same kind, she's now happier about how she looks, as she kinda looked chubby before-- but it turned out it was her spine pushing things in directions they weren't supposed to go.  She's taller now.  She doesn't hurt as much (she had a severe curve).  She's wearing different clothes because she's proud of herself, some now.  Just remember that if it won't make you better, they wouldn't be wanting to do it.  They only do back surgery if it's warranted.  It also doesn't take as long to heal as it used to, so you will be up and around ASAP.  It's scary, but in the hands of good doctors, you'll be better than before, so look forward to it and keep your chin up.  Talk to your family and ask for a hug when you need one.  If you can't sleep, find out who you can talk to when you need some one on one in the night or maybe even ask your doctor for some meds to help, if possible.  Good luck and blessings!"

Since you're only 15 I would just wear a nice pair of pants (not jeans..preferablly black pants) and kitten heels, a nice collared shirt or something professional looking.  Don't wear anything revealing, tight, low cut, etc.  Have your nails manicured (or at least trimmed to one lenght...do not wear bright colors).  Have your hair pulled back from your face in a bun or pony tail.  This will make it less easy to tug at your hair if you're nervous.

"Real Estate Sales Contract Question---> Tenancy in Common or Tenancy in Severalty?
A man is buying a property without his wife being on the mortgage. Does he have to take title by ""tenancy in severalty"" or could he do a ""tenancy in common,"" and can this be changed before closing if we figure out the best way AFTER the contract is signed? (not hiring or inquiring of an attorney, obviously)\nThanks for your help and answers!!
First is this an investment property or is there another reason this is to be titled on of these ways?  There are some differences depending on the state laws of ownership.  \nTenancy in Common has at least two parties on the title.  It can have more than two but it is not a right of survivorship title. \nTenancy in Severalty is only one party  and does not share rights or liabilities with any other person.  When the owner passes on the property goes to their heirs or their estate.  \n\nHope this helps."

5'4"" @ 120lbs is not bad. However if you want to loose whatever fat you have you should eat the correct foods and assuming you are doing that then figure out your daily caloric needs to sustain your current weight then simply cut 500 calories out of that diet but be sure to spread you meal out over 7 to 9 meal which means every 1.5 to 2 hours. The calculator to figure your calories is linked below.\n\nYou should also do some form of cardio training 3 to 5 times per week for 30 to 45 minutes but do not exceed 60 per session.\n\nPS Whatever you do please do not cut our the good carbs and good fats out of your diet or you will not burn fat as efficiently as you would be eating them."

"how to STOP internet addiction?
the internet is undoubtedly addictive.my college provides free access to the internet 24 hrs in the hostel so i got hooked up. apart from stop using YAHOO answers, what can i do to control myself? H.E.L.P.
The only way I have ever stopped an addictive behavior is by replacing is with something else. In the case of having an internet addiction it is SO hard to do because avoiding computers is almost impossible these days. (It's kind of like being an alcoholic that owns a liquor store!) \n\nTry to assess what part or parts of the internet are most alluring to you and the time of day when you are most likely online. Is it games? Message boards? Chatting? All of the above and more? \n\nNow, plan about a week's worth of activities to replace your internet time. (Example: set goals to finish things you have been putting off like cleaning closets, organizing school work, etc., plan activities with real-life friends, get books to read, call on co-addicted friends that would like to cut back and plan to do something non-computer oriented together like exercising or playing sports...find anything that you can do that will keep you mentally and/or physically engaged rather than get online. \n\nPlan on doing this for only ONE week. By setting a one-week goal you are more likely to stick with it because you can stand anything for one week, right? At the end of the week you may find that you aren't as hooked and the withdrawal pangs are subsiding. You also may find that certain areas in your life have improved because of spending time on other things rather than the internet. The rewards from this may be enough to encourgage you to spend your time OFF the computer. If so, then try it for one more week.\n\nGood luck..and we hope NOT to see you around for at least ONE week! If it doesn't help, then at least know you are certainly not alone with this particular addiction! *wink*"

After seeing my results he said i was a Diabetic prescribed no meds only to lose weight (im like 40 pounds overweight) and exercise.\n\nIm also been taking beta blockers a week and a half prior to the test (25mg every night) and i wondered if that may influence the test somehow, so what do you guys think?
Sorry, I don't know the answer to the beta blocker part of your question.  If you're continuing to take them I strongly suggest you do some online research; there's a lot of junk info to wade through, but it will give you a better idea of side effects, differing opinions, etc.\n\nAs to the diabetes diagnosis:  I think you've been diagnosed pre-diabetic.  If it were full-blown diabetes you WOULD be on medication.  I had the same diagnosis, and with some lifestyle changes (excuse the phrase) I brought my sugar back into the normal range within 3 months.  Some things to do:\n\n1)  Avoid processed sugar and processed grains.  READ LABELS.  Lots of things have high fructose corn syrup in them.  And if the first ingredient is ""wheat flour"" it's been processed.  You're looking for bread whose first ingredient is ""whole wheat flour.""  It's not that you can never eat them, but try to avoid them whenever possible.  It's hard to do if you're eating out a lot.\n\n2)  Increase your fiber intake, especially soluable fiber.  Oatmeal, apples, there's plenty of information about this on the internet.  Lots of soluable fiber helps your body regulate the insulin/sugar balance.\n\n3)  Excercise.  A simple 20 minute walk after lunch or dinner.  Put on some music and dance.  You're not trying to buff up or lose weight, but to increase your metabolism.\n\n4)  If you live where you can go to a reputable acupuncturist, I really recommend you give it a try.  It can really help balance your system, which is the goal you're aiming for.\n\n5)  Take 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon every day.  This is not as nutty as it sounds.  There's some excellent research that it helps long term diabetics -- even my doctor had heard of it! -- and it can't hurt.\n\nIf you cut down on processed sugar and grain, and move you body more, you will lose weight, although slowly.  I would NOT recommend going on a diet of any sort, because you're trying to get your body to work in a more balanced and efficient way, and any kind of extreme eating is going to screw that up.\n\nGood luck!"
"Watched the Da Vinci code film?You will have noticed the round wooden item called a cryptic.Do they exist?
If you have watched the Da VinCi Code then surely you would notice that the round wooden item called a Cryptic was disigned by ""Da Vinci"". I would like tho know if these ""Cryptics"" are real or a work of fiction by Dan Brown. If ""Cryptic"" do exist then could someone so me plans of them or recommend a website that has any information about them. At ""supercurlyking@yahoo.co.uk"".
Cryptics do infact exist. I have seen a couple before in musuems, as to how to make one or where to get plans for one not sure. Check for websites about Da Vinci and you might find them, or do a search for ""cryptic"""
"are periods regular after childbirth?
i had my daughter 3 months ago...my period is late...could i be pregnant or are periods irregular after childbirth?
Are you breastfeeding?  If so, you won't get your period until ater you stop.  Even if not, sometimes the body needs a few months to get back to normal.\nHowever, if you do not get your period that does not mean that you cannot conceive.  But it also does not mean you are pregnant."
"what does it mean to be human???

Biologically, it's a genetic question- For an easy definition, it would be that you are born from humans.\n\nWe dont know if aliens even exist, let alone what the characteristics they would have.\n\nBiologically, humans have many systems that are less efficent, more poorly built, or just all-around not as good as other animals.  The list is nearly endless, but our immune system doesnt come close to that of rats and mice, our brains are not as complex in structure as that of a dolphin, our skeletal structure is fairly delicate and not well evolved for walking (thus the backaches and knee problems), we have far more auto-immune diseases than other animals studied..etc etc.\n\nYou could not even use characteristics such as speech, emotions, etc, because there are many humans that, because of brain trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, or birth abnormalities do not have these as well, but who would say they are not human?  Newborn babies cant speak, empathize, build anything, use tools-yet they are certainly human.  Thus, the only strict definition would be that you are born from human parents."
"is gatorade bad for you? ha really random but i want to know =)?
since im an athlete, i run ALOT. but to keep hydrated, i drink water and everything but someone was telling me that gatorade is really bad for you? and thats what replenishes me better than water. so what do you think? is it?
it's both. it's got a high sugar content which is definitely not helpful but it's also got important electrolytes that your body needs replaced. it's one of the best replenishers out there."
"how do I brun fat quickly?
excercise
By increasing your metabolism.\n\nYou can do so with many techniques, such as increasing muscle mass or doing a sufficient amount of cardiovascular exercise. Be careful not to overstress yourself with too much exercise, or else your body will catabolize your muscle cells and convert them into fat (read about cortisol).\n\nIt is also important to eat an adeueately balanced diet and get 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Make sure eat plenty of the required daily nutrients while avoiding excessive intake of food at unnecessary levels (stay away from low carb and no fat, you need them both for hormonal support). You may also want to ration three big meals into five to seven smaller ones, eating more per day but less per meal, along with plenty of water (one fluid ounce for every two thirds per pound of body weight), especially around workouts. If you have the ""once I start I just can't stop"" eating habbit, replace all the excess food with water.\n\nJust follow the basic essentials without cheating more than twice a week (and if you do, don't let it discourage you from reisting), avoid stressing yourself out and just relax."
"how can people say with such authority that they know what God wants?
or what exactly is a sin? \nexample- being gay is a sin. or having sex outside of wedlock is a sin.\naccording to who? \n\nit's not God but man (men in power who want to control the flock) that has said so. quoting scripture doesn't make something true. how can you be sure it means what you think it means? i can take scripture and interpret it to mean what i think it means... \n\nand ~God hates the sin and not the sinner?!? who has Polled God lately? couldn't we be projecting our own human charactristics (fear, hate, judgment) on something so way beyond anything human. \n\ncouldn't it be that this statement is true- \nGod is UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, \ntolerant and non-judgmental, yes, even of people who are those things (fearful, hateful, judgmental)\n\nwe must decide for ourselves our own boundries, but why try to enforce them on others and use the ""word"" of God as an excuse to hate. it makes you powerless, a fearful child. instead of a truly creative Divine being
because they worship words, books not God. I think this essene text as said by Christ himself sums it up best\n\n""Seek not the law in your scriptures, for the law is life, whereas the scripture is dead. I tell you truly, Moses received not his laws from God in writing, but through the living word. The law is living word of living God to living prophets for living men. In everything that is life is the law written. You find it in the grass, in the tree, in the river, in the mountain, in the birds of heaven, in the fishes of the sea; but seek it chiefly in yourselves. For I tell you truly, all living things are nearer to God than the scripture which is without life. God so made life and all living things that they might by the everlasting word teach the laws of the true God to man. God wrote not the laws in the pages of books, but in your heart and in your spirit. They are in your breath, your blood, your bone; in your flesh, your bowels, your eyes, your ears, and in every little part of your body. They are present in the air, in the water, in the earth, in the plants, in the sunbeams, in the depths and in the heights. They all speak to you that you may understand the tongue and the will of the living God. But you shut your eyes that you may not see, and you shut your ears that you may not hear. I tell you truly, that the scripture is the work of man, but life and all its hosts are the work of our God. Wherefore do you not listen to the words of God which are written in His works? And wherefore do you study the dead scriptures which are the work of the hands of men?"""
"Tricky Problems. Really NEED HELP?
1)Two contestants take turn tossing a coin. The first one to toss tails wins. The one who tosses first has a greater chance of winning than his or her adversary, but what are their respective chances exactly.\n\n2)A car travels from A to B at the rate of 40 mph and then returns from B to A at the rate of 60 mph. What is the average rate of the round trip.\n\nPlease show work thanks
The second problem is easier than the first problem, so I'll tackle it first.\n\nLet's imagine that the trip is 120 miles. The distance doesn't matter if the average rates are as given above.\n\nIt takes 3 hours to travel 120 miles at 40 miles per hour.\nIt takes 2 hours to travel 120 miles at 60 miles per hour.\n\nSo it took 5 hours to travel a total of 240 miles.\n\nThis is an average rate of 48 miles per hour.\n\nI'll work on the first problem and hopefully I'll get back to you.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI think I have the first problem solved as well. It involves an infinite series! Call the people involved A and B.\n\nThe probability that A wins on the first toss is 1/2.\n\nIf A doesn't win on the first toss, then the probability that B wins on the second toss is also 1/2. But this only happens in 1/2 of all games. (In the other half, A won on the first toss.)\n\nIf B doesn't win on the second toss, the the probability that A wins on the third toss is also 1/2. But this only happens in 1/4 of all games (In half the other games, A won on the first toss. In half the remaining games - 1/4 of all games, B won on the second toss.\n\nFollowing this logic, A wins:\n\n1/2 + 1/4(1/2) + 1/16(1/2) + 1/64(1/2) + ...\n\nof all games.\n\nB wins:\n\n1/2(1/2) + 1/8(1/2) + 1/32(1/2) + ...\n\nof all games.\n\nLooking again at A, we have:\n\n1/2(1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ...)\n\nThe term in parentheses is an infinite series having initial term 1 and ratio 1/4.\n\nThe sum of an infinite series having ratio whose absolute value is less than 1 is equal to:\n\na/(1 - r)\n\nWith a = 1, and r = 1/4, the sum = 4/3. So:\n\n1/2(1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ...) = 1/2 * 4/3 = 2/3\n\nLooking again at B, we have:\n\n1/2(1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/128 + ...)\n\nThis sum should be half of the sum of the infinite series in A.\n\nWith a = 1/2 and r = 1/4, a/(1 -r) = 2/3\n\nSo:\n\n1/2(1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/128 + ...) = 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nA should win 2/3 of the time, and B should win 1/3 of the time. There is an advantage to going first!"
"What causes the mysterious disappearances at the Bermuda Triangle?
It could be a theory or a fact. Please, explain it in non-scientific terms.
The energy source is methane gas and there are no alien spaceships or suburbs of Atlantis here. The myth of the Bermuda Triangle, the mysterious disappearances and strange events, has generated much interest all over the world through the years. Charles Berlitz’s book on the subject, published in 1974, sold nearly 20 million copies in 30 languages. Ships, boats, and even aeroplanes are all said to have disappeared in this area and all the mystery has been attributed to extraterrestrials. But scientists now have an explanation for these phenomena and the cause is not extraterrestrial but chemical. It goes by the name of methane gas hydrate, which is methane (created by decomposing organic debris) that has been entombed in an ice crystalline. Conditions are ideal for the formation of this gas in areas of permafrost. Another area is the deep sea floor where the pressure and the temperature are right for the creation of this gas. \n\nIt was only in 1981 that a geochemist, Richard McIver, went public on a link between methane gas blowouts and the Bermuda Triangle myth. He stated that massive landslides often occur along the North American continental shelf, which lies to the north of the Bermuda Triangle. Such land slumps can occur over a large area bringing down huge boulders which rupture the layer of gas hydrate beneath the sea floor, freeing the gas that is trapped beneath the hydrate ‘cap’ and also liberating huge amounts of methane trapped within the hydrate itself. The moment a methane gas pocket ruptures a vast reservoir of gas suddenly surges from the seabed, rising up in a huge plume before erupting on the surface within seconds and without warning. A ship caught in such a blowout would be doomed; the water beneath it would suddenly become much less dense, sinking it in a matter of moments. The vessel would plunge into the depths, where it would be covered as sediment disturbed by the blow out settles back on the sea floor. In fact, planes too could fall prey to such a deadly fallout. \n\nThe US geological Survey has estimated that just two small areas off the coasts of North and South Carolina, which are a part of the Bermuda Triangle, contain about 70 times the quantity of gas consumed annually in USA. The sea bed and the areas of permafrost are therefore storehouses of a great energy source. It has been estimated that just 1% of gas hydrate is equivalent to half the present conventional gas reserves. But the bad news is that methane is a greenhouse gas and it is vulnerable to blowouts when drillings go wrong. It is only stable under narrow temperature and pressure conditions and would decay due to global warming. We will have to wait and see whether it gives us energy to burn or it burns us up instead!"

"Do you know where?
I am currenty in college and have alot of bills to pay. I want to know where I can find a GOOD PAYING JOB that will help me get thru college.......Any suggestions?
Perhaps you can find a job that allows you to study most of the time, killing two birds with one stone.  For example, parking garage booth attendant or motel/hotel night clerk.  Both positions may be hard to fill evenings and weekends, if you can be available.  Waitress or bartender could pay well if the place is busy (evenings and weekends) and the tips are good.  I had a friend who worked his way through college as a McDonald's night manager.  You need a part time job (during hours others don't care to work) that will not interfere with your education but needs an intelligent fast learner. Good luck."
"what is racism to you, and how do you think it will ever end, how?

To me, racism is our instinctive fear of the unknown without the discernment that comes from wisdom. We focus on the outward appearance without searching the content of the character-- leaving fear and ignorance as the motivator for subsequent actions. Racism, unfortunately, seems to be too closely related to ""survival"" in the minds of those that subscribe to it so, unless mankind experiences some sort of 'evolutionary leap' or something, racism will probably be around for the duration of our current existence."

"how do i stop my body from keeping me up all the time . how can i get more sleep when neccessary ?
MY MIND IS TIRED , BUT MY BODY KEEPS ME UP .I FIND MYSELF GOIN TO SLEEP AT 8 O CLOCK AM .AND WAKING UP AT 6 PM . MY MIND IS EXHAUSTED ON A DAILY BASIS . IM NOT ON DRUGS . WHY IS MY BODY SO TIRED ALL THE TIME ?
Hello.  Sleeping from 8am to 6pm means you are sleeping a good number of hours, the only aspect that could be considered as negative would be that your falling asleep at 8am, and not earlier.\n\nI have experienced this before, often during the holidays and I could have sworn I would never escape it, but I did.  I believe that this is mostly a bad cycle that is difficult to get out of.  \n\nI find the best solution is to break the cycle by force.  I would force myself to wake up at the hour I wish to wake up at (10am for example) and even if I had slept only 2 hours I would wake up and get out of bed.  Having slept so little it will be easier to fall asleep earlier the next night, and when you wake up the next morning, you will have slept several hours and should feel more rested.\n\nIts also worth noting that sleeping 10 hours during the day does not have the same rest and recovery effect on your mind and body as does sleeping during night hours.  So while it is difficult, it is worth trying to make the effort to get your body used to sleeping 'normal' hours even if it's difficult at first and takes a couple of sleepless nights to achieve.\n\nRight now I don't have this problem because my job requires me to wake up at 6am so I have had no choice but to get my body used to sleeping at 11pm (even though it was not easy at first).  Nonetheless when I'm on holiday, I automatically start falling asleep later and waking up later, and when the holidays end I have to adapt quickly.\n\nGood luck!"

"If you have genital warts/HPV, how can you ever have sex again without transmitting them to your partner?
I was diagnosed with genital warts/HPV today. I am taking Aldara which should remove the warts themselves in 2-3 months. But I have read that the virus stays with you for at least 6 months-2 years and possibly even for life.\n\nSince HPV cannot be prevented with condoms (because any skin-to-skin contact in the genital area can transmit it), I am wondering how I will ever be able to have sex during the next 2 years without fear of transmitting it to my partner?\n\nI don't want to transmit an STI to anyone else because that would be evil. But does that mean I have to remain abstinent? is there any way to cover up the affected area (the perenium and anus) and still have sex?\n\nAnd also...the fact sheet the doctor gave me said that 75% of Americans 18-48 years old have or have had genital warts/HPV !!!! (although it is not always symptomatic). \nThat suggests that almost everyone you see has the virus already, and that having sex wouldn't matter because they already have it. \nI'm confused!!
lisent. HPV NEVER leaves the body. it only has outbreaks, from time to time, and it will depend on your inmune system and mental health. I dont know who told you that, but he/she is wrong. if you dont have an outbreak, you can  have without any prevention, but it isnt 100% secure. i recomend that you use a condom (male or female one). if you feel like tickles in your genital area, you will have an outbreak soon, so dont have any sexual relationship. if you dont have any outbreak, remember to wash the genital area very well, and dont forget to drink your medicine to prevent any outbreak. The HPV can be prevented by condoms ONLY if you dont have any outbreak. and is false that the 75 americans have HPV in the genital area, but is true in other parts of the body, like the chicken pox, that is another kind of HPV. dont worry,  you can have a secure and happy sexual life. ps, i'm a medicine student"

"What we wear??
Has anyone heard of any experiments where people wear the same thing two or three days in a row to see if anyone will pay attention or tell them they noticed it?  My co-worker wore the same things two days in a row and said she was doing this social experiment for her sister.  The kicker is, I really hadn't noticed until she said something.  Do people really pay that much attention to that sort of thing anymore?  I have a hard enough time trying to remember what I wore the day before, yet alone what someone else is wearing.  It has to be something really stunning for me to notice.  <:/
That is funny brecause I rarely pay attention.  I have heard of people doing this.  I rarely wear the same thing the next day, not that I would have a problem with it, as long as the clothes were still clean.  I guess I still remember how much other kids noticed it when I was in school.  My parents made me wear the same things two or three days in a row and the kids always noticed it and always made a big deal of it- I tend to still be a little self conscience about it.\nEvidently it is not that big a deal anymore or at least ofr adults-  I was reading an article in a cheesy magazine in my doctors office just two days ago and they had all these pictures of superstars - there were two pics of each of them, evidently taken one day apart from each other and they were in the same outfit both days with just an accessory, like shoes, scarf or jacket changed.  The article was not condescending- this question was funny in light of that!  Evidently for the rich and famous- the paparazzi notice.  For the rest of us, I guess no one really cares."

"what is RX Diversity, how it can be acheived??

Rx diversity utilizes multiple antenna elements to provide gain in the receive path of a wireless system. \n\nFor example in a mobile wireless telecommunications system (cellular) RX diversity is used to provide gain and improve coverage. 2 receive paths (antennas lines etc...) are used on a cellular tower. The antennas are typically placed 10 feet apart at the same elevation on the tower (the further apart the antennas the more gain achieved, although after about 10 feet not much additional gain is achieved). Both receive the mobile signal, and the base station electronics then looks at both paths for the ""best signal"" (not exactly how it works, but in laymans terms it's close enough). This improves quality for the mobile, and typically yields @ 10db improvement in the link budget. It is effective in eliminating raleigh fading, and other signal impairments.\n\nThere is also Rx diversity used on the mobile side. \n\nTo achieve diversity, the receiver needs to have the capability of accepting multiple receive paths (two or more), and then either combining, or switching between the paths."

"Are there any other satanists left in the world, or am I alone?
I can't be totally alone in this, can I? I have never met another satanist, except on satanist websites, but apart from that, the satanic community looks invisible. Have they all been slain by religious schizos? What the hell happened? If you know any satanist, can you put me in contact?\n\nAnd if you're a Christian, please don't say you'll save me and god loves me. Hell, it's a concept, I don't believe in deities. So leave me the fuck alone with your salvation.
Let me take a moment to go on record as saying that the majority of the responses above more than adequately show the lack of respect and hypocracy that is rampant in the Christian community (see the ""Why do Christian's Bash Everyone?"" question, where everyone says ""we don't bash - other's bash *us*!"" mmhmm.)\n\nAnyways, Just to let you know I've seen a steady Satanist community over on beliefnet.  While I may not practice your beliefs (or the Christian's beliefs either) I do respect your right as an individual to believe and practice as you will, to whatever brings joy to your life.\n\nIf everyone could bring an ounce of compassion to thier lives, and perhaps act like civilized human beings (and not a torch wielding mob) the world would be a much safer and happier place.\n\nGood luck in your search :)"

"What will happen after the thousand year reign when Christ comes back?

When Christ returns He will reign on Earth for 1000 years, during which time those within The New Jerusalem will be with Christ and reign with him. All inside will have spiritual bodies and participate in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. Outside will be all unbelievers who've disobeyed God and rejected Jesus Christ, they will be survivors from the battle at Armageddon and those left alive in the world. Also during this time Satan will be bound in the bottomless pit. This means no death or disease, just peace and prosperity. Once Satan is released, he and all those outside will once again rebel against God and attack the New Jerusalem. Fire from Heaven, which will destroy the old heaven and earth so a new Heaven and Earth can replace it, will destroy them all - physically. Then comes the Great White Throne of Judgement.That's about as brief as I can possibly get. Read the Scripture given below as a reference and you'll see for yourself. It's very plain, easy to understand and straight forward."
"Does anyone know a good way to relax or feel good without having to worry about the bag things that hap pend?

This may sound silly, but do not worry about the bad things that happened.  What is done is done.  Remember, you choose your reaction to a situation.  \n\nI went through a lot of junk.  I eventually decided that I was not going to let it hold me down.  I left all the baggage at the door and did not come back for it.\n\nWhatever you do, try and stay away from drugs.  Drug companies make drugs to treat symptoms, not the cause.  The cause of worrying is your outlook on life.  Most of the problems in life are relating to this.  Too many times, people use drugs as an excuse to not deal with the root cause."
"Why does time slow down as a traveler approaches the speed of light?
Why does time differ for identical twins if one is placed on a spaceship and travels near the speed of light vs. the one that stays firmly planted on earth.  If aging is a biological function of cell production, would this process slow down for our spaceship traveler?  Would it be possible to produce a time dilation field using gravitational waves that would nullify the effects of time differential for the near light speed traveler or would this require a source such a a black hole?
At the molecular level, you have an electron which has a maximum speed of the speed of light running in circles around the proton. All molecular activity (time) is based somewhat on how many times it circles the proton in a given time period. As the proton reaches near light speeds, the electron takes extra time catching and passing it in the direction of travel, thus slowing the revolutions and any molecular activity (time)"

The best calcium is that which occurs naturally in the foods we eat.  Brocolli, spinach, almonds, milk, cheese are great examples of calcium sources.  \n\nThe problem with supplements is their efficacy- some brands are more readily absorbed than others, and absorption can depend greatly on your individual body makeup.  Supplements are also an expensive way to admit you don't eat your veggies."

"Are you in favour of the Monarchy or against? And why?

Aside from the king of Thailand, there is not a single monarch who has a significant influence on the political affairs of the country.  Thankfully, the Thai king doesn't have his head up his rump and actually does things that benefit the country.\n\nThe rest of them are a waste of space.  It's bad enough that, for example, the British monarchy does nothing, but to spend tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars on pomp and ceremony is pure waste.  \n\nTo allow barely 20 people to live in luxury while tens of thousands live in poverty (when the amount spent on the 20 would lift tens of thousands OUT of poverty) is a disgrace.\n\nAnd that's just England, never mind any other countries.\n\n\n."

"is ibogain legal?and if it is legal where can we bring it?
it is called godgrass also,planting in africa,it is used for cosmic experiences and saving from addictions etc..
I know Ibogaine!!!\n\nIt is from an African shrub, I have seen it in two forms, one ground up bark in gelatin capsules and also HCI.  It was white and in a gel capsule.  I have witnessed treatment several times.  It is leal in Canada, the UK and other parts of the world.  What else do you want to know?\n\nI happen to have some in my safe right now, really.  Yes it is a schedule 1 in the US.  But no dogs are trained to sniff it and it looks like Valarian Root.  Of couse it does not act like that, it is a drug that can compare to no other.  Long live the Iboga shrub.  \n\nLast resort for hard core drug addicts.\n\nANd for the other answer you got....drug dealers are not a good source for Ibogaine.  Herbal companies in Canada, and the UK are.  I know.  IT can be shipped to Canada, taken in Canada, but don't go alone.  Read lots.\n\nGood luck.  For the record, Gavol is best taken at least 3 hours before taking Iboagaine.  I repaet, read all there is before the adventure.\n\nThe answer below me is accurate, it is off of other web sites that I have visited in the past.  Some of the deaths associated with Ibogaine treatment were not controlled, I mean the addict in one case, snuck drugs into treatment.  ANotehr person was very ill to begin with.  That I beleive was the most recent death, I think in Mexico.  I have met one very famous guitar player that is going on his third year clean after going to a treatment center in Mexico and having the Ibogaine trip.  \n\nKeep in mind that doing drugs has a certain amount of danger associated with it as well.  There is always the chance of having a heart attack, getting arrested, going to jail and prison, lsoing your children, your wife or husband, and so on.  It is all risky business, that is why I call it a last chance therapy.\n\nTHe gavol is for nausea, by the way."

"Where does the gravity go?
When matter is converted into energy, what happens to the gravity it was emitting? Is the sun constantly losing gravity?
During fusion hydrogen is converted into helium and the mass does NOT stay the same.  A small fraction of the mass is lost to energy, and this how the sun produces all its energy.  So yes the sun is losing mass and the force of gravity is decreasing but the fraction of the mass that it is losing is negligible."

"Why do people who are on drugs, always complain of severe back pain?

Back pain is often associated with the kidneys.  Your kidneys are located near your back, alongside your spine, but above your waistline. Each kidney contains over a million nephrons. These nephrons are necessary for proper kidney function.   Nephrotoxicity, one of the most common kidney problems, occurs when your body is exposed to a drug or toxin that causes damage to your kidneys.   When kidney damage occurs, you are unable to rid your body of excess urine, and wastes. Your blood electrolytes (such as potassium, and magnesium) will all become elevated. These conditions can often cause pain."
"If evil was really good...?

what people tell you is right, is right for you, and what people tell you is wrong is wrong for you, if youre evil, then, since most people arent, you'd be against most people. For you evil is right, and you'd know that for other people it's wrong, since they're against evil. You see, there aint much difference between right and wrong."

"Is Easter a Persian holiday?
What is the ancient history of Easter, I've heard that it originated in Persia and that it wasn't really to celebrate Jesus' birth to begin with and that it was originally a pagan holiday. Does Anybody know about this?
EASTER NOT FOUND IN THE BIBLE\n""The English word 'Easter' came from the Anglo-Saxon Eastre or Estera, a Teutonic goddess to whom sacrifice was offered in April, so the name was transferred to the Pashal Feast. The word does not properly occur in Scripture although the AV (King James Translation) has it in ACTS 12:4 where it stands for 'Passover' as it is rightly rendered in RV (Revised Version). There is no trace of Easter celebration in the New Testament..."" (INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLE ENCYCLOPEDIA VOL.2, P.889). The word 'Easter' has confused some but the word in the original form is ""Pascha"" meaning ""Passover"". It occurs 29 times in the New Testament & everytime it's translated Passover except in Acts 12:4. If you read carefully (ACTS 12:1-4); it says that Herod killed James and was trying to kill Peter in an effort to ""vex the church""(Please the Jews). Then in VERSE 3 ""were the days of unleavened bread""; see LEV.23. He put him in prison intending to try him ""after Easter"" (KJV). Now if Herod was trying to ""please the Jews"" & ""vex the church"" Why would he have delayed the trial until after 'Easter?'"" BY GROVER STEVENS (WWW.BIBLEANSWER.COM/EASTER2.HTM) If this was a ""christian holy day"", especially one in honoring Christ's resurrection, he would surely not be pleasing the Jews, Wouldn't it be more pleasing to the Jews to vex the church by killing one of it's Apostles on it's own ""holy-day,"" would it not?\n\nORIGIN OF EASTER: WHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nEaster was never observed by the Apostles of Christ or Christ's Religion. ""The name 'Easter' comes to us from the mythlogical writings of the Ancient Teucrians (who lived 1200BC along the southern coast of Palestine) where it's known as 'Ostern'"" BY GROVER STEVENS. ""The name 'Easter' is merely the slightly changed English spelling of the name of the ancient Assyrian and Babylonian idol goddess, Ishtar (pronounced eesh-tar)."" WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY says ""Easter is from the pre-historic name of a pagan spring festival."" THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH ETYMOLOGY says, ""Easter is derived from the name of goddess whose feast was celebrated at the vernal equinox."" THE SCHOLARY NEW SCHAFF-HERZOG RELIGIOUS ENCYCLOPEDIA says, ""This goddess is also widely known as Astarte...The cult originated in Babylonia and spread to Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria & Palestine, then through the Phoenicians to all of the Meditteranean peoples...Ishtar was in fact primarily and chiefly identified as Venus, the most beautiful of celestial objects & from the terrestrial side, the primarily motive of the worship of Ishtar was the impulse to deify sensuous and sensuality.""

Absolutely, if you are married, you can always file ""married filing jointly,"" regardless of where you live or if you're seperated. There are no legal or tax problems with filing this way, so you don't have to be worried. \n\nUsually, people who are seperated want to file ""married filing seperately"" because they can't stand one another. Unfortunately for them, they can only possibly file seperately if they have lived in seperate residences for at least one full year."
"why is there so much back biting and hatefulness in the workplace? especially in nursing?
if the model of nursing is caring, then why is there such a lack of it between health care professionals?
Competitiveness for one.  And two,  The nurses are in a tight spot.  They have an obligation to the patients.  They also have to stay under the doctors and respect the rules and regulations of the hospital administration.  Even within hospitals there is political crap to get through.  With that in mind the nurse has to get through all that.  I would be grouchy too."
"dear atheists ?
according to you there is no God or afterlife.. will you sell your soul to me.. for free\n\nyes/no
You are one egotistic asshole. You answered my Sylvia Browne question and she goes beyond the bible. I've read the bible, I know all about Jesus but I am my own person and can take my beliefs to a different height. You obviuosly only have faith in one person and that is yourself. So why don't you re-read the bible and quit being so judgemental of other religions. As long as someone has faith, then that is all they need. Atleast that person has something to live for other than themselves, like you."
"why is it that when you ask a nasa official?
when you ask a nasa official about if man kind can go on the moon again this year, 2006, why do they say no. was it just a hoax in 1965 when they said that we landed on the moon or was it real? wasnt the us competting against the russians in 1965 and thought that the only way they can outrun the russians was to send man to the moon. if they did then why cant they send man to the moon again. the technology is much greater today than 1965, so why cant we go up there again? was nasa lying about neil armstrong going to the moon?
""...was nasa lying about neil armstrong going to the moon?...""\n\nNo, definitely not. It's unbelievable how many people prefer to accept the half-baked, erroneous ""proofs"" that show men never landed on the moon to the undeniable scientific facts that prove we did. Take the time to read the facts on this non-governmental website ==> http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html\n\n""...the technology is much greater today than 1965, so why cant we go up there again?...""\n\nYes, our technology has greatly advanced since 1969, but at this time we simply don't have the necessary hardware to put men back on the moon---no Saturn-like boosters, no life-support systems required for manned lunar voyages, no lunar landing equipment, etc.,. It's true that we could build all the necessary equipment, but a number of factors discourage further manned lunar exploration--the space race is over, the American public has lost interest in the moon, and NASA's budget is far below the levels needed to ramp up again for manned lunar flights."

The web links would probably give you this eventually, but the short answer is a microwave is called a microwave because it uses electromagnetic waves with a wavelength on the order of a ""micron"" (which is 0.000001 meter, or 0.001 mm, or 1000 nanometers, or 10000 Angstroms)"

"Could I build my credit history this way (see details)?
Apply for a credit card with 1 year 0% Introductory APR.  When the intro APR runs out, apply for another card with the same 0%introductory APR for another year and repeat.  This way, I pay no interest.
No! The way to build credit is to get the card and buy something and pay it off. Do this for about 6 months with no defaults in your payments. After 6 months call them and ask for a credit increase. Then buy something and pay it off. Do that for another 6 months to a year and ask for another increase. In the first 6 months other creditors will see that you are doing well (especially if you get the 1st credit increase) and they will send you their cards. No matter what you will pay interest with any card!"
"What can I do to help my friend get through a suicide in the family?
His father just recently shot himself. There were a lot of family issues going on. The father was very strict and I think the children resented that and rebelled. I'm not sure why he committed suicide but I think it has something to do with the children, mainly the oldest, rebelling and getting into trouble. There could be something I dont know though.
I lost my grandpa to suicide about 8 years age but I will never forget what I went through. I was very close to him and no matter how many people told me that it was going to be ok it didn't matter then. Dealing with that sort of grief is very hard and it is also hard to process a lot of things. The best advice I can give you is be there for anything they need. Let your friend know that you are sorry and will be there through this for him or her no matter what. Over time things will get better but it will take time. Be patient and understanding with your friend. He or she is going to go through some hard times but having a friend that cares close by will help a whole lot. I hope this helps. I had a friend there for me and it helped a lot."
"what makes up the Hindu religion?

It seems clear from the hymns of the .Rg-Veda and the Persian Gathas and Avesta that the Vedic Aryans and the Zoroastrians had a common origin. The languages in which Zoroaster preached and the Rsis sang their hymns are almost identical, and Vedic meters are re-produced in the Avesta. Evidently, the two groups of Aryans separated after a violent quarrel, so that several deities of one group - Indra or Jindra, Sarva and Nasatya - were transformed in the other into evil spirits. It is, however, to be noticed that Mitra, Aryama, Vayu and Vrtraghna are divine in both the systems. A period of unity was probably followed by civil war, as envisaged in the fight between Asuras and Devas. \n\nThe Vedic Aryans were warlike, while the Avesta reflects an abhorrence of war. In the period when the ancestors of the Iranians and the Hindus had lived together, Asura had been a term of honour; and the Zoroastrian Ahura Mazda was Asura Mahat, the great Asura. The .Rg-Yeda (III-55-11 & 15) cites several Asura qualities of the Divinities. Varuna, Mitra and several other gods were called Asuras. Later, when differences were accentuated between the two communities, Asura became equivalent to a spirit of evil and Sura came to signify a good spirit. \n\nThe undivided Indo-Iranians must have passed a long time in their Central Asian home. The Indo-Iranian culture and religion have been reconstructed, at least in part, by comparing the Vedas with the Avesta. Before the occupation of Iranian high lands by tribes from the Indo-Iranian original home, the plateau was the seat of a culture that was probably matriarchal, and the people worshipped snake-gods in the manner of India's primitive non-Aryans. It is likely that the pre-Aryan cultures of North- western India and Iran were alike in origin and spirit. \n\nThis ancient cultural link between pre-Aryan Iran and pre- Aryan India, instead of getting strengthened by Aryan migration into the two countries, as could be normally expected, was to all appearances completely severed. Also, there is nothing to show that the Vedic Aryans of India maintained an active cultural relation with their brethren in Iran. \n\nIn the earliest days, while the Aryans of India must have been connected with the Aryans of Iran as friends or as foes, actual historical contact cannot be asserted with any degree of probability. The two peoples turned their backs upon each other, as it were, and developed their distinctive civilisations apparently without the least mutual influence, although in language, culture and religion their similarity in the earliest period had been little short of identity. When, later in history, under the Achaemenids, Greeks, Bactrians and Sakas, the Iranians and the Indians were forced to meet as citizens of the same empire, they met as complete strangers, not as cousins or as scions from the same stock. The earliest literary productions of the Aryan settlers in India were the Rg-Veda, Sama Veda (consisting of chants), Yajur Veda and the Atharva Veda (a composite religious and magical compilation) The Vedas comprise Mantras (hymns ), Brahmanas (ritual and ceremonies), Aranyakas (forest speculations) and the philosophical Upanisads. In the context of This commonly accepted interpretation of the Vedas, it may be recalled that European Orientalists have too often considered them mainly from the theological, anthropological and sociological points of view. A study of the material in its religious aspect is difficult, since even the great commentary of Sayana is in terms of the ideas of his own age. On the presumption that the Vedas originated in primitive times, the Rg-Veda hymns were regarded as the outpourings of a child-like nature worship. John Dowson in his Hindu Classical Dictionary observed: ""The Aryan settlers were a pastoral and agricultural people, and they were keenly alive to those influences which affected their prosperity and comfort. They knew the effects of heat and cold, rain and droug"
"What are the causes of red-green color blindness?

There are two types of light receptors in the human eye - rods and cones.\n\nRods are very sensitive to light, but don't see color well.\n\nCones require brighter light to work, but they are used for color vision.\n\nThere are three types of cones... one for each primary color.\n\nIn red-green color blindness a genetic defect causes the cones that detect green light to be missing or to not work.  The result is vision with no green component."
"my ex bf has a new gf and always compares me to her y?

Obviously this is a case of a classic attachment issues. You got to ask yourself was the breakup clean and was it where one person broke up with another. In the latter case, this could pose to be a situation where the guy was not ready for a breakup.\nAnother answer is that he could be just using these tactics as an act of jealousy. Isn't there a golden rule that half of the amount of time you went out is the time you should spend recovering. 6 weeks is a short time for a relationship that was a year. So he is just using as a sort of cat and mouse game and is trying to entice you to get back with him.\nPlus, it is always common for guys to compare themselves with other guys. An great example of that is when a guy asks if I was ever the best in bed."

Also why the hail marys? Why is she looked to so much with catholics?
because the catholic religion is all about tradition. \nand nobody in leadership has bothered to look at what the bible says, instead, they go by the ritualistic traditions which are actually un-biblical.\n\nconfessing to a priest will do nothing for you, coz God says to confess to Him. \nthey sometimes use the excuse of the scripture that says ""confess your sins one to another"".. but if you read that passage, you will realise its talking about discussing your sins honestly with others in order to be accountable to someone to change. but its only God that we get forgiveness from.\n\nas far as Mary goes? again, they dont read the bible where it says that you are only to pray to the Father in heaven in Jesus name. they also obviously missed the spot where it forbids you to talk to the dead. mary is dead. she was awesome, but she is dead at the moment, in heaven and unable to hear them. it says nowhere that she and only a selected special few are saints. we are all saints when we are saved into Christ Jesus. thats what God calls us, saints.\n\nif any catholics dont believe me, take a look at all of the epistles, alot of them start with ""to the saints of (insert place like ephesus or corinth here)"".

"The best way to lose weight by July 19th?
I want to lose about 10 or 15 pounds, what is the best way? Thanks for your help.
Just use your head.  \n\nYou know the only way to lose fat is to burn more calories than you eat.  \n\nYou know each pound of fat = 3500 calories.  It is simple arithmetic.  \n\nThe best thing you can do is work out.  Start out slowly so that you build up your strength and endurance gradually and don't hurt yourself.  Then, as you get stronger and longer-lasting, you can really put your body to the test.  And at that point you will have to ask yourself if you really do want to lose weight after all - because extra weight to the athlete = stored energy."
"What kind of intelligence could exist fully formed from nothing?
Here in the real world we can see that intelligence is a product of growth and learning and development.  It's a measure of how well we apply what we have learned from the past to situations we are dealing with in the present.  Even if you don't accept that human intelligence is the result of 4 billion years or so of evolution, it's still clearly the case that a new born baby is pretty clueless, and only becomes intelligent over the years by learning from experience.\n\nTheists assert that an intelligent god exists, fully formed, from nothing, with no history, no growth, no learning from experience, no development of any sort.  I would like to hear someone explain the nature of that intelligence such that it can exist without experience and without even the passage of time.

Interesting.\n\nI agree with you whole heartedly as an atheist myself.\n\nBut, to defend the Xtian mindset a little (just for the sport of it):\n\nGod is omniscient: all knowing.  So that means He knows what you, I, and every other scholar in the world knows.  So, He just leaches off of our knowledge.  \n\nConsidering that the Xtian God is not on a linear timeline, He is omni-present, He knew the stuff we know now, and everything else that has ever been learned in the past or will be learned in the future.  \n\nSo, He knew everything at the same time as knowing nothing!\n\nI think I just gave myself a headache."

"Wat is information age?
am doing a courwrk on information age and dont have clue wat is ti and how i shud do it. ..HELP!!!!
Information Age' is a name given to a period after the industrial age and before the Knowledge Economy. Information Age is a term applied to the period where movement of information became faster than physical movement, more narrowly applying to the 1980s onward. Under conventional economic theory, the Information Age also heralded the era where information was a scarce resource and its capture and distribution generated competitive advantage. Microsoft became one of the largest companies in the world based on its influence in creating the underlying mechanics to facilitate information distribution. It has been estimated that the Information Age lasted from approximately 1971 to 1991. One could argue, though, that it actually began during the later half of the 19th Century with the invention of the telephone and telegraphy. It is often used in conjunction with the term post-industrial society. When information ceased being scarce, the Knowledge Economy commenced. The Knowledge Economy started around 1991 and continued to approximately 2002. The current economic era is defined as the Intangible Economy. In the Intangible Economy, four factors of production - knowledge assets (what people know and put into use), collaboration assets (who people interact with to create value), engagement assets (the level of energy and commitment of people), and time quality (how quickly value is created) are the four key resources from which economic activity and competitive advantage are primarily derived and delivered today. It is helpful to understand that Google (GOOG) is now a serious competitor to Microsoft as it relies on Intangible Economy principles to run its operations.\n\nEarly Information Age\n\nIn 1837 Samuel Morse created a device which converted physical movement into electrical impulses that could travel over large distances. In 1844, telegraphy was used to transmit data along an experimental telegraph line from Washington, DC to Baltimore, Maryland. Slightly more than 20 years later, the first telegraph cables were stretched across the Atlantic Ocean, in 1858, but failed to stay in operation; however, uninterrupted service began in 1866.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nThe information technologies of the 19th century allowed faster and wider dissemination of information than previously possible. However, ultimately such information had to be reduced to the same form which had been the final form for centuries: paper, whose analogs go back to stone and clay tablets. With the development of what was called wireless transmission, when combined with the ability to transmit voice and sound from the telephone, and recording technology, a new medium began to be born, which placed a different final result in the hands of the individual. These technologies would eventually become radio.\nInformation technology\n\nWith recording technologies, transmission, and with early computers, it didn't take very long for scientific advances to merge together into the new field of Information Technology. Information technology is the use of technology to enhance the speed and the efficiency of the transfer of information.\n\nThe information age continues to this day, and technological advances such as mobile phones, high speed connections, Voice Over IP have changed lifestyles around the world and spawned new industries around controlling and providing information."

Compare the oxidation numbers of each element from the product and the reaction; if the number increases, it has been oxidized; if the number decreases, it has been reduced.\n\n1) 2Na + S ----> Na2S   so....\nNa=0, S=0 ---> Na=1, S=-2 (just look at the period table to get the last two numbers)\nNa goes from 0 to 1, so it has been oxidized, and Na is also the oxidizing agent.\nS goes from 0 to -2, it has been reduced, S is the reducing agent.\n\n2) K=oxidized, oxidizing agent\nCl=reduced, reducing agent\n\n3) Al=oxi, oxi agent\nO2=red, red agent\n\n4) H=oxi, oxi agent\nCl=red, red agent\n\n5) N=oxi, oxi agent\nH=red, red agent\n\nOn all of them, the first element is oxidized as well as oxidizing agent; and the second is reduced, and the reduced agent."
"Why is Marijuana illegal?

Pot is illegal because the War on Drugs is a cash cow for the government. And it also keeps undesirables - minorities, the poor, criminals - under control. It is a lot easier to bust a black kid with pot on him and get him convicted than a white kid. It's all part of the hate machine that our government's becoming.\nHey Figato - go ask your kids for a joint, smoke it, and chill the heck out man."

"Newton's second law: lab?
he slope of the linearized acceleration vs. mass graph should be equivalent to the net force, and the slope of the acceleration vs. net force graph should be equivalent to one over mass. Explain why. Calculate the %error for each slope\nhow do i do this?\nand for the % error i keep on getting 91% no matter how i tried
In your lab you are dealing with the relationship of:\nf=m*a\nso a=f/m\n\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus mass holding force constant, this is a non-linear graph, so it will depend on the range of your data.  As m gets large, the slope will approach zero.  As m gets small the slope will approach infinity, which makes sense.  The instantaneous slope of this line is -f/m^2.  So your error will depend on the relative magnitude of the mass with respect to the net force.\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus net force while holding the mass constant, the slope of this line is 1/m.  Your error will depend on the accuracy of the system.  If the coefficient of kinetic friction is not a constant, or the force applied is not a constant, then error will be introduced into the system.\n\nj"
"distinguish between knowledge and wisdom?

Knowledge is what is known. Like the related concepts truth, belief, and wisdom, there is no single definition of knowledge on which scholars agree, but rather numerous theories and continued debate about the nature of knowledge.\n\nKnowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, learning, communication, association, and reasoning. The term knowledge is also used to mean the confident understanding of a subject, potentially with the ability to use it for a specific purpose.\n\n\nWisdom is the ability, developed through experience, insight and reflection, to discern truth and exercise good judgment. Wisdom is sometimes conceptualized as an especially well developed form of common sense. Most psychologists regard wisdom as distinct from the cognitive abilities measured by standardized intelligence tests. Wisdom is often considered to be a trait that can be developed by experience, but not taught. When applied to practical matters, the term wisdom is synonymous with prudence. Some see wisdom as a quality that even a child, otherwise immature, may possess independent of experience or complete knowledge. Contemporary culture limits the importance of wisdom and intuition, particularly American culture; Wisdom/Intuition is a right brain activity, while logic is a left brain activity.\n\nThe status of wisdom or prudence as a virtue is recognized in cultural, philosophical and religious sources. Some define wisdom in a utilitarian sense, as foreseeing consequences and acting to maximize the long-term common good."
"What aspects of being a child do you miss the most (if any)?

I prefer adulthood and never feel a desire to return to childhood, but there are a few things I miss.\n\nI miss not having to work for a living. I miss not having bills and student loans to pay. I miss all the free time I had in the summers and from not doing my homework. I miss going to a class on the first day of school knowing that I had already read the textbook from when my brother had the same class two years earlier. I miss winning first-place trophies in math competitions without having to make much effort. I miss being able to remember most of the events that had occurred in my life. I miss the feeling of equality that most kids had, at least before middle school. I miss having a computer that I actually knew how to program, even if it had ""only"" 64K of RAM. Perhaps above all else, I miss being able to imagine any future that I wanted, from becoming President of the United States to hitting the home run that wins the World Series to having children. Now I know which of those dreams will never come true, even though some of them have.\n\nChildhood wasn't all good, but it did have its advantages."

"why are magnetic lines of force crowded near the poles of a magnet?

Ed's right.  To further explain the inverse square law, in simple terms; move twice the distance away and the force is NOT 1/2, but 1/4 the power.  Move half the distance closer and the power increases 4 times (not 2 times).\n\nUnderstanding this simple equation will open many things to understanding why and why not the things that can be done.\n\nEnjoy."
"I am gaining weight really fast.  What can I do to stop it?
I am a 14 year old female.
I would see a doctor first thing.  If you are sexually active be honest with your doctor.  See what your doctor recommends for a diet.  They have diet plans.  Ask your doctor to recommend an exercise ( I would think any cardiovascular, example: bicycling, swimming) If you diet do not stop eating.  Eat a healthy well balanced meal and every meal.  I would drink plenty of water to flush your body and maintain your metabolism.  Your doctor may recommend smaller portions.  Cut out any junk foods.  Eat a a good breakfast, good lunch, and light dinner.  When you sleep your body shuts down so you aren't digesting at a normal rate.  If you need snacks I would recommend fruits or vegetables."

I know the Queen is great and has many many responsiblities but I was wondering exactly how much power she has?  Back in the olden days the Kings and Queens made all the decisions so what does our Queen do?
Assuming you mean the Queen of England -- she has no political power whatsoever.  She does, however, have money and no doubt many political / affluent connections.\n\nShe has no real power, though.  She's just a figurehead.  The monarchy was abolished as a real political entity in the UK long ago."
"what is mean by oesteoporosis?

Hi Visu !!!\n\n""Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and more likely to break. If not prevented or if left untreated, osteoporosis can progress painlessly until a bone breaks. These broken bones, also known as fractures, occur typically in the hip, spine, and wrist.\n\nAny bone can be affected, but of special concern are fractures of the hip and spine. A hip fracture almost always requires hospitalization and major surgery. It can impair a person's ability to walk unassisted and may cause prolonged or permanent disability or even death. Spinal or vertebral fractures also have serious consequences, including loss of height, severe back pain, and deformity.""\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n""Reduction in the quantity of bone or atrophy of skeletal tissue; an age-related disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and increased susceptibility to fractures."" - From Stedman's Medical Dictionary. \n\n\nPlease go through the below articles for valuable data about osteoporosis.\n\n>>> Naveen Kumar"

"why would the california employment development department audit my small business and what can i expect?

I am not really sure why they would be auditing you. The only thing I can think of would be if you were previously employed outside the home, lost your job and then collected unemployment benefits at the same time you were receiving money from a small business that you had started. If this is the case, and you did NOT report your income to them from your small business, (and they somehow found out about it) - well, then that would be one reason they would be auditing you."

You are in for a long night if you can't use a calculator to find determinants, because Cramer's Rule with 4 equations needs to have five 4X4 determinants evaluated.  Anyway.....\n\nTo find the first variable, make a fraction with a determinant formed by taking the 4 coefficients from each of the 4 equations on the bottom of the fraction, and a determinant formed by taking that bottom determinant and replacing the First column of coefficients with the answer column on the top of the fraction.  Then evaluate each determinant to get your first variable.\n\nTo find the second variable, the bottom determinant is the same but this time on top replace the Second column of coefficients with the answers.\n\nEtc, etc.\n\nDon't stay up too late; I am going to bed.

"Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important?

The practical applications of math are endless. The basic math like algebra and geometry is vital knowledge for being able to solve everyday problems. The higher math is very useful in professions. If you're any kind of scientist, you'll need to know everything up until at least differential equations, and definitely further for chemistry and physics. Statistics is a real, very common application of mathematics that shows up everywhere- being able to take a set of real data that probably isn't perfect and still managing to analyze it to find patterns. Calculus also shows up frequently in businesses when they are attempting to optimize conditions in order to maximize profit or decrease cost.\n\nAside from applications, math fosters more analytical, rational thinking. This is why Plato taught geometry and arithmetic to his students before subjecting them to philosophy: so that he could develop their critical thinking skills. Just being able to solve complex problems is a wonderful skill that can be developed through mathematics. The mathematical study of logic is also quite practical.\n\nAnd surely you don't think that all of the world's technology just popped out of the air without somebody doing a lot of math along the way?"

"why is satan competing easily with God?

Because man is stubborn and abuses God's gift of free will. \n\nMany people put other gods before the True God, for example: wealth, appearance, material goods, envy, etc. Abusing these things brings us instant gratification and gives us a feeling of power.\n\nWhen we have that feeling of power, we believe that we're as good as God, or that we don't need Him. Even Jesus was tempted, but temptation isn't a sin. Giving into a temptation IS a sin. Man is weak and falls into too many traps set by Satan.\n\nIf we learned to use our free will in a more God-like manner, Satan would have far less competition."

"what is love ?

Wow. Good question. Since there's no definite answer to this question, I'll put this in the form of an opinion. Love, to me, is the feeling you get when you can't live without someone...can't stand to be away from them for a minute, a second even. Love is an emotion that manipulates a person into doing the most crazy things to get a person's attention, all in attempt to solidify a commitment with that person. Love is what keeps a marriage together for many a year, and what keeps together a family. It's a feeling you have when you see your first-born child and get to hold them in your arms for the first time. It's a power that overcomes you when someone you care deeply for passes from this Earth to the Heavens. It's an emotion that keeps this world rotating, in my opinion."

I'm thinking taking a Medical and Dental Office Assitant course and i was interested in knowing how much some one can earn in that career. I want to know if it's worth me taking the coure.\nCan some one help me??
It depends on where you live, how high you place in your class, and how busy the doctor's office is. A ballpark would be $25,000-30,000 a year, right out of school, and up to $40,000-45,000 a year once you gain maybe 5 years experience and get your certifications.  \n\nFor what it's worth, this is a pretty good career choice (unlike massage therapy, culinary arts and many of the other courses you see advertised on TV) because it is fairly easy to get a job with decent pay; you usually get benefits even in your first job; and the demand is strong."

"what are some of the foods should a child be feed if he has tooth decay.?

The only important thing is to limit sugary snacks and to brush the child's teeth twice daily.  Many children will suffer from ""baby bottle mouth"" if they are allowed to take bottles to bed with them.  They will drink milk, juice, or another sugary drink in bed and this will pool in there mouth and cause tooth decay.  The American Acadamy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that children should see a dentist by their first birthday.  The dentist will be able to provide education for the parents regarding proper tooth care and also to screen for any signs of periodontal disease or tooth decay."

"Why do hearing people get nervous about dating a deaf person?
Other questions:  If a deaf person asks you (hearing person) out, what would your first thought be?   Would you be honest and say ""no"" if you felt uncomfty with it?  Why, if you are willing to share?
There are a lot of ways to look at this issue. From my perspective, I see it as an advantage. You automatically weed out the superficial losers that just want something from you. There may be fewer guys that are willing to commit to a relationship with someone who is impaired in any way, but they are more likely to be quality men. It's not a whole lot different than a woman with children if you think about it. It's not you who really has the problem, it's those who are afraid to commit or to leave their personal comfort zone to experience something new and different that have the problem."

My son is having all 4 out tomorrow and I was wondering what groceries I should pick up for the weekend???..I still have mine so I don't really know what would be best!
Soft foods like baby food, apple sauce,.... He shouldn't be eating anything that can leave small pieces in his mouth(this can cause dry socket which is no good.). I bought some of those Ensure drinks to at least keep up nutrients while recovering. The dentist should be able to tell you how long, but he should rinse with salt water after eating for at least the next week, maybe longer. As for not eating solid foods, that's usually a couple of days, but even at that, he may have some discomfort and not want to eat anything too hard either. I  didn't eat solid food for 5 days, but that's just me."
"How can nitrogen be obtained at normal temperature by subjecting it to high pressure?

You can use a PSA system (Pressure swing Adsorption) to purify Nitrogen to about 98.5% from air. The rest will be Argon - it's difficult to remove Argon from air using a PSA system. Lurgi has a system to do this. It is also best suited for fairly low volumes. The adsorption works at room temperatures, but high pressures. When the adsorbent is saturated it is regenerated by lowering the pressure in what is termed a regeneration cycle."

If you google for 'dvd' and 'screenshot' you should be able to get a freeware program to pull off the shots.  \n\nFrom there you can drop them into any editing programme.\n\nLet me know if you need other info."

"Electron and molecular geomoetry of C2Br4?
C2 would be linear and Br4 would be tetrahedral, but what about C2Br4? Does the 2 and 4 cancel each other out?
no too sure since its been a while since iv done this, but its a simple enough molecule, C2Br4  2Br to each carbon and a double bond between the carbons, its a linear moleule, not sure about the electronegativity of the elements as my notes r all packed away but the Br atoms should sit slightly of veritcal from each other toward the outside of the molecule. and im sure that the two halves sit at 90 degrees to each other, not sure if u call it this but if u do then 2 Br attached to one carbon will sit along the x- axis of the molecule and the two Br attached to the other carbon will sit along the Z-axis, ask ur tutor or teacher if this is correct as im not 100% sure\n\ntetrahedral only applies to CBr4, thats because the 4 Br are comin off the same carbon, because there are 2 carbons it changes it all together\n   (ignore the full stops, needed them to position the atoms decently)\n\nBr&#92; ........ /Br\n.......C=C\nBr/ ........ &#92;Br\n\nThis is not perfect but imagine the top Br on the left aiming toward you at 45 degrees and the top one on the right aiming away at 45 degrees, hope this helps"
"Why do grapes ripen in a bunch all at the same time, but blueberries ripen in a bunch each individually?
Grapes growing on a vine cluster much the way blueberries cluster on a shrub.  The grapes all ripen about the same time, however, whereas the blueberries have to be harvested throughout the season - each individually.  Why?
because grapes grow in bunches, they are all attached, blueberries dont grow in bunches, they are single, each one is picked one at a time, so they are all different, therefor they ripen at their own speed."

"What are the reasons Diabetics cant drink?
I know that we can, I've seen tons of people do it... its just I've had so many people tell me not to, and its been a while since I had a doctor tell me not to drink that I cant remember the reasons they say you can and some reasons they say you cant.
Some of those answers are right but alcohols like beer contain barley and hops, a type of grain. Drinking beer is like eating a loaf of bread and bread is a carb so carbs raise your sugar and high sugar is bad for you. Wine is another story, the main componet in wine is grapes/and or other types of fruits and you know fruits are high in sugar so thats like eating fruit and also the alcohol in it will have an adverse affect on your insulin so thats really why you are not to drink too much. The girl that gave the list of amounts is right thats what they say we can have in one day, but if you are set on getting drunk and keeping your sugar under control drink liquor, like vodka and gin in mixed drinks NOT containing fruit juices, I suggest diet pop/soda or straight."

"what do they first treat a wound with in a hospital? alcohol? ""spiritus""? and how does it kill germs exactly?
and how does soap kill germs?
Alcohol would not be used to clean a wound as it would destroy healthy tissue cells. A wound caused, for instance, in a RTA may need cleaning of foreign objects such as glass or soil and this can be done by gentle irrigation with saline or surgical removal if necessary. During the healing process sloughy tissue may form (dead cells) and again these can be removed by irrigation with saline. Extensive areas of dead tissue would have to be removed to promote healing. There are also some products which can break down dead tissue and may be applied in the form of a gel or paste. Often silver is incorporated in wound dressings as this has been found to have an anti-microbial property. For 'open' wounds ie where the surrounding skin cannot be brought together by stitches or adhesives, when  the wound is clean the aim is to create a moist (but not wet) and warm (body temperature) environment to promote healing.\n\nSubstances such as iodine should no longer be used as it has been found to be absorbed and is harmful - although some surgeons continue to use it.  \n\nSoap does not kill bacteria but breaks down grease and helps to clean the skin. Effective washing technique helps to remove bacteria but alcohol gels are more effective than washing with soap."
"What would happen if 75% of the U.S. population became genuine Christians?
Think about it. If 3/4 of the U.S. would stop lying, stealing, even little things, cussing, getting drunk, using drugs, having elicit sex, aborting babies, gambling, watching un-wholesome movies & T.V. shows, listening to un-wholesome music, wouldn't be interested in whay Oprah or Dr. Phil have to say, and instead love their neighbor as themselves?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying that doing all those things would MAKE someone a Christian, but if someone DID become a Christian through genuine repentance and faith, that would be the end result.\nWhat do you think?
The other 25% would leave."
"tricks for quickly inserting iv lines in ambulatory setting?
I'm starting a job at an amb. suregery center in a hospital, where every pt requires an iv. I usuallyenter the vein alright and get blood flashback, but have trouble advancing the catheter and frequently blow the vein.  I'm often able to float the catheter using the iv solution  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?
Starting IV's is an acquired skill that can take a while to really get the hang of. As a medic I have seen many different approaches to getting the stick on the first try. Allot of problems I see when people can't advance the catheter is because it isn't in the vein all the way. After you get flash in the angio chamber drop your angle and advance the catheter just alittle further. Then try advancing it. This will ensure that the catheter is in all the way. Another trick is to not hit the vein from the top. You can try a slight angle and hit it from the side. This will help with troublesome veins that roll on you. Hope this helps."

A farmer buys feed...\nchicken feed cost .47 per ton\npig feed cost 1.23 per ton\ncattle feed cost 1.44 per ton\n\nthe farmer can't buy any partial tons\nhow much of each would he have, if he bought 100 tons of feed and paid 100 dollars???\n\nplease help me i need it
Lets convert the problem to cents.\n\nIn equation form, with c for chicken feed in tons, p for pig feed in tons, and b for cattle feed in tons, we have\n47c+123p+144b=10000\nc+p+b = 100\n\nEliminating c, we arrive at \n76p+97b = 5300.\n\nSo p = (5300-97b)/76 = 69-b+(56-21b)/76\nLet z = (56-21b)/76 then\n76z + 21b = 56\nSo b = (56-76z)/21 = 2-3z+(14-13z)/21\nLet x = (14-13z)/21\nThen 21x+13z=14\nSo z=(14-21x)/13 = 1-x+(1-8x)/13\nLet y = (1-8x)/13 then\n13y+8x=1, x=(1-13y)/8 = -y+(1-5y)/8\nBecause this can go on for quite some time, let y=5, then x = -8, z = 14, b=-48, and p=131.  Shifting answers by the original values (76 and 97), b=-48+76, p=131-97, so b=28, p=34; therefore c=38.

"what does gazoontite mean?

Gesundheit is the German word for health. When a person sneezes, Germans typically say Gesundheit! to wish them good health. This expression has found its way into the English language via Ashkenazi Jews who were immigrating in large masses to the United States during the early twentieth century. It is sometimes used instead of the more common ""bless you"". Also, in Germany it is a common phrase used before giving a toast. Gesundheit is also used in Australia. It was imported to South Australia through the Evangelical Lutheran refugees who fled the established Lutheran church in the east of Germany. These Silesian immigrants spoke their own language until the two World Wars caused a dramatic decline in the use of German in Australia. Gesundheit was used until recent times by the majority English speaking population. Its usage seems now to have declined.\n\nThere are different theories regarding the origin of this phrase. One idea is that the expression stems from the Middle Ages when the Bubonic Plague was threatening European health. In this case the person saying gesundheit was actually wishing good health upon themselves, since they may have been infected by the one who sneezed. During this time it was also commonly believed that sneezing made one's body vulnerable to evil spirits. Thus another plausible explanation is that gesundheit was a blessing to ward off demons while the sneezer's body was defenseless."
"who are the anasazi?

Ancient Pueblo People, or Ancestral Puebloans is a preferred term for the cultural group of people often known as Anasazi who are the ancestors of the modern Pueblo peoples. The ancestral Puebloans were a prehistoric Native American civilization centered around the present-day Four Corners area of the Southwest United States. \n\nArchaeologists still debate when a distinct culture emerged, but the current consensus, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification, suggests their emergence around 1200 B.C., the Basketmaker II Era. \n\nThe civilization is perhaps best-known for the jacal, adobe and sandstone dwellings that they built along cliff walls, particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras."

I was reading some questions and answers search by PDD.\nADHD has the same symptoms as PDD - \nADHD is treated by medication\nPDD is autism which is not treated by Medication (may be harmful?)\nADHD could be the same as Bi-Polar (searched for bi-polar)\nBi-polar sometimes mistaken for Manic Depression?\nBetter (in some cases) to be treated by Psychiatrist as oppose to Pediatric.\nThis is pretty confusing, but I really appreciate everybodies thoughts, researched knowledged, and experiences.\nMy son is currently on 54mg of concerta for ADHD.

I like for him to visit without me so that he feel free to say anything he wants.  Sometimes I think he say what he thinks I want to hear.\nThanks
I would have him evaluated by a pediatric specialty team at your nearest children's hospital or rehab center. My daughter was dx'd with ADD/ADHD/PDD-NOS and then High-functioning Autism by her ped and later by state funded physical and occupational therapists through early intervention. She was medicated at the school's insistence for ADHD. When that made things worse instead of better, we had her evaluated at our local pediatric rehabilitation center and learned that she was actually a perfect match for the symptoms/actions of Aspergers Syndrome and early onset bi-polar disorder. The reason the meds made things worse was that with bi-polar, you can't give just the anti-depressant, you have to do a mood stabilizer as well, or the manic symptoms will intensify and often times go out of control. Hope you find the help you need to help your child"

"Roleplaying! Whee! (Hey, ten points is ten points)?
I am sitting in a bookstore at a small table with one chair, surrounded by magazines (Japanese pop culture, Gothic Beauty) and a small but substantial stack of books (a  thick horror tome, something National Geographic, something threateningly intellectual with a huge name, and a Funny Quotes compilation). I'm wearing a dark green midlength dress with a black vest that laces in the front like a corset. (Yay Salvation Army.)My hair is grayish-purple, longish. I'm looking annoyed as I lose my page, then nonchalant as I look at the guy behind the counter, and finally amused as I read something really funny and finish a chocolate wafer cookie. You look at me as if you want to talk to me. I look up, grin, and continue reading my book. You look at me again and smile; Finally, I get up and walk over to you and say: ""Hello, my name is Bijou. You seem nice. Do you want to talk to me?"" Well, in real life, would you?
Sitting in a bookstore can be rather tedious at times, but it's a good place to meet women who are interested in something other than sparkly shinny objects.

Why must I freeze every time I find someone I might be interested in? As you stand up, time seems to slow down. Every single posiblity of what may happen comes accross my mind. Would you leave, having caught me staring at you? Would you come over and tell me to get a life? I evaluate what I decided to wear that day and regret every single item.

Why couldn't I have put my pants in the washer after spilling mustard all over them the night before? At long last you reach me, and the unthinkable happens. You actually want to talk to me.

"correct puncuation for a word?
I have a question if I am personalizing something and the name is Hodge but I want it to say The Hodge's, do I want Hodge's or Hodges???
Let's suppose that the father's name is Bob Hodge, the mother's name is Mary Hodge, the son's name is Tim Hodge and the daughter is Susan Hodge.  Thus if they put a sign on their mailbox it would read, ""The Hodges.""  This is the plural, thus indicating that there is more than one person with the name of Hodge living there.  Note that there is no apostrophe as there is no possession indicated.  It is simply the plural.  If you are sending an invitation to an entire family with the same name, you may address it to simply ""The Hodges"" although it might be more personal to write ""Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hodge and family.""\nNow let us assume that Mary Hodge buys a car.  It is thus Mary Hodge's car.  This is the singular form of the possessive.  Now let us suppose that Mary and Bob buy a car together.  In fact this is the family car.  This is the Hodges' car.  This is the plural possessive.\nI hope this clears up the matter. Judging from the answers you have received already, you aren't the only one with this difficulty."

From personal experience, all you really need is a mat, a book and/or DVDs to practice at home. And if you're not that flexible, you should get a yoga strap and yoga bricks.\n\nSo, as far as the equipment above, they are more catered to (but not limited to) those specific programs or programs like it.\n\nIt also, just boils down to how much money you're willing to spend. Amazon.com has good prices on yoga DVDs, books and equipment/kits and you can get free shipping on items over $24.\n\nI also know from personal experience that a stability ball is a good piece of equipment to have, but of course, not necessary to have a successful yoga practice.\n\nHave fun!"

His eyes swell and run, he also sneezes back to back.
If you do not control his runny nose, (post nasal drip) it WILL become a wonderful highway for bacteria that  causes bronchitis.  Please ask your doctor what he recommends.

Then I would dust, vacuum thoroughtly, and get any pets and pet hair out of the house if possible;if not bathe the animals to cut down the hair and dander.  Give him lots of fluids to keep the mucous thin and therefore will not carry as much bacteria.  He must be miserable.  God Bless."
"What can a person do to relieve chigger bites?

Listerine eases itch from chigger bites\n\nPeople's Pharmacy\n\n      Question: I am intrigued by the unusual ways people use Listerine. Every summer, I am plagued with itchy chigger bites. After reading that Listerine could relieve shingles pain, I tried applying it to the bites.\n      This is the most helpful remedy I have ever used. The itching stopped immediately and did not resume. The bites healed quickly. Thanks for a terrific idea.\n      Answer: The herbal ingredients in Listerine (thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate) have both anti-fungal and anti-itch properties. This might explain why applying Listerine Mouthwash to the scalp or the skin can relieve dandruff or itching.\n      Dermatologists tell us that itching is an allergic reaction to the chiggers' secretions. Doctors sometimes prescribe a dab of a topical steroid such as Lidex or Temovate. If Listerine works, so much the better.\n\nThere's more tips on the website below!"
"Why cool ethanol?
In terms of extracting DNA, why does it improve the ethanol to cool it?
If, during the precipitation step, you use cold alcohol, or incubate in a freezer (I like that because it's a good stopping point if necessary) your yields will improve because the solubility of a liquid decreases as it cools.\n\nIf you have a solution of NaCl in water, and start to chill it, you will get to a point where the salt comes out of solution, because the solubility has decreased along with the temperature.\n\nSorry for the needlessly long answer, but it's due to changes in solubility between the DNA and the alcohol."

It is a Slavic language and in my opinion something between Serbian and Czech.\n\nAround the border there are bilingual areas with Hungarian or Italian...\n\nAnybody older than 25 will speak Serbian / Croatian because Slovenia used to be in Yugoslavia...\n\n\nENGLISH IS VERY WIDELY SPOKEN especially amongst the young..\n(Let me give you an example...I went to the cinema in a small town in Slovenia to watch some American comedy..and the whole audience  were commenting and joking with themselves about the film in ENGLISH!)\n\n\nAt school As the first foreign language, English or German may be studied, with English chosen in 85 % of cases and a share of 15 % for German. The languages offered as second foreign language are German, French, Spanish, English, Russian, and Italian. In bilingual areas, Slovene, Italian and Hungarian are also taught as second languages."

"tring toget small business grant but can not find where i left off at ,from gov.grants?

It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"
"I was wondering if anyone could check if I did this problem correcctly involving freezing pt depression?
Here is the problem: Ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) is the principal ingredient in antifreeze. How many grams of ethylene glycol will be needed to lower the freezing point of 2100 g of water by 20 degrees Celcius? Kf for water is 1.86 C/m. \n\nthe answer i received is : 3495.8.  Is that correct? if I used sig figs, is the answer 3500?
Assuming the volume of Ethylene and water is NOT additive and the calculation is done in STP.\n\nDensity of water = 1g/1ml therefore 2100g = 2.1L water\n\nUsing Equation: Delta T = i(Kb)m\n\n22C = [(1.86C/m)(x)]/2.1L\nSolving for x = 22.58mol Ethylene glycol\n\nSince Molar Mass of Ethylene glycol = 62.06g/mol\n\n22.58mol(62.06g/mol) = 1401.31g of Ethylene glycol Needed.\n\nConverting to correct Sig Fig: 1401.31g = 1400g Ethylene.\n\n(Technically your answer should be 1000g due to One sig fig in 20 degrees in Celcius, but you usually never want to put any answer in 1 S.F., so I would leave it with 2 S.F.  I hope this helps.)"
"are there people here who have left religion altogether?
if so can i know why and to which religion you belonged before leaving/
My husband and I believe in God and have faith in Jesus, not religion. Both of us have tried different religions throughout our lives but it seems like they all have negative aspects. We feel that we don't have to associate with any particular church or religion to have a relationship with God and we are much happier for it. We also believe that since God created this earth, then God is everywhere, so why should we have to confine our worship to a building or on a particular day?"
"is doctor clyde carpenter of olmpia wa a good spine surgeon with a good success rate?

Check your local State Medical Board (Link is at the bottom)  I would also check with the Hospitals your Doctor is affiliated with.\n\nMy only disagreement with the information listed below is that I have an Orthopedic Surgeon who specializes only in Spine Surgery (the statistic below of 50% is not enough for me)\n\nWhat to look for in a spine surgeon:\n \nIn today's complex medical field, it is important for patients to be as involved as possible in their own medical care. This includes the choice of doctors. Some managed care programs leave little room for choice, but if you are able to choose your physician, here are some guidelines on what to look for in a spine specialist: \n\n1. Make sure the spine surgeon is board certified (or board eligible) and fellowship trained in spine. This means that in addition to the usual surgical residency requirements, he or she has completed a fellowship program in spine that included at least one additional year of training specific to spine surgery. \n\n2. Choose a spine surgeon who devotes at least 50% of his or her practice to the treatment of spinal conditions. A physician who sees mostly spine patients will be more up-to-date on newer technologies and techniques than a physician who only sees spine patients occasionally. \n\n3. In addition to the physician's credentials, make sure the physician you choose is someone you feel comfortable with. After all, finding a physician you can trust is almost as important as his or her experience. Good communication is essential in a doctor/patient relationship, so ask yourself these questions: \n\na. Does the doctor answer all of your questions and provide you with enough information about your condition? \n\nb. Does he or she spend enough time with you? \n\nc. Is the physician reachable? Open-minded? A good listener? \n\nd. Does he or she welcome a second opinion? \n\n4. Talk to the physician about his or her experience with the latest techniques and technologies in spine surgery. How many procedures has he or she performed? Is the doctor willing to refer you to any former patients who may be available to share their experiences with you? \n\n5. Talk to the physician, or someone in the office, about your medical insurance to find out what is covered and what you may be responsible for. \n\n6. Choose a physician who is referred to you by a reliable source such as your primary care physician, or a friend, or relative. You can also use the physician referral services at your local hospital for additional information about the doctor. Also, SpineUniverse has over 2,500 spine specialists registered. To find one in your area click here.\n\nCautions \nThere are also a few things you should be cautious of when selecting a spine surgeon. Avoid any doctor who does the following: \n\n• Discourages or does not allow second opinions. \n\n• Suggests ""exploratory"" surgery. With today's sophisticated imaging technology, this is rarely necessary. \n\n• Does not answer all of your questions (or makes you feel bad about asking them). \n\n• Tries to influence your decision to have surgery. Remember, it is totally up to you whether or not you have surgery. Your doctor's job is to provide you with enough information to comfortably make that decision. \n\n• Bypasses conservative treatment options. Surgery should always be the treatment of last resort - when other non-surgical options have been exhausted. \n\n• Is not forthcoming about treatments, techniques, costs, outcomes, and expectations for recovery. \n\nIf you have concerns about a particular physician, you can contact your state Medical Board to find out whether the practitioner has ever had disciplinary action taken against his or her license. The Federation of State Medical Boards lists each of its members at the following address: \n\nwww.fsmb.org/members.htm \n\n\nGood luck and God Bless!"
"Are Venus Fly traps easy to care for?
I am thinking on getting one to help alleviate the little black bugs that fly around the house.  Any advice?
Venus fly traps are relatively easy to care for.  All they really need is to be kept in a bowl of distilled water or rain water.  While they will do reasonably well being kept like this all year round, they do best given a cool winter dormancy.  If you live some where with cool winters you can just put your plant outdoors in the winter.  If you live somewhere with very warm or very cold winters try to find someplace a little cooler in your house.  For a little more detailed care info check out:\nhttp://californiacarnivores.com/vft_growing_tips.htm\n\nAll that being said, in my experience the easiest to grow carnivorous plants are the purple pitcher plant and most of the sundews.  While prey capture in both is not as dramatic as with a fly trap, they eat a whole lot more."

"Why would God allow a 14 year old boy to set up the true church as described by the Mormon church?

A ""14 year old boy"" didn't ""set up"" the Mormon church. Joseph Smith accounts to having seen a vision when he was 14 years old. Through subsequent heavenly visitations, visions, and revelations, he continued step by step in restoring Christ's church to the earth once again. It was a process that continued throughout his entire life. It didn't begin when he was 14 years old and it certainly didn't end when he was martyred at 39."
"how can one differentiate by physical and chemical methods the differences between ionic and covalent compound

Well it's tough because on one hand, an ionic compound is really likely to be a salt of somekind (CaCO3, NaCl).  But, on the other hand, you could have metals such as aluminum which forms an oxidized coating (Al2O3), which itself is ionic.  So you are looking at a brittle and maleable material.  In addition, not all salts are as soluble as NaCl.  Hmm... tough... good luck."
"if you are travelling in a space vehicle at the speed of light,and u turn on the headlights..do they come on?

At the speed of light you gain infinite mass so the light beam from a headlight must go faster than light to escape the headlight it's self.If the beam could be a higher energy of light like gamma rays and if you could see a gamma ray which human eyes can't then maybe you'd see something. The question is will they come on,yes because\nthe electricity will flow through the filament of the bulb so it's on but can you tell by eye?No,because it would take forever for the light to reach your eye at equal speeds."
"health insurance?
Ok here is my problem, I was a full time college student and decided to become a part time student for this semester. I use to be covered by my parents health insurance but only if I was a fulltime student. Do you think  I could reapply next semester since I'm deciding on being a full time student. Do you think this will work out?
You are referring to a policy that most health insurance co's have, in this if a child is under 23 (confirm with  your co) but over 18 you will need to show proof that he/she is enrolled as a full time student.  So depending on your age, you may or maynot be able to jump back on your parents policy.  Confirm with your parents HR person, I highly advice you retain a Individual plan asap, here is why.  In life we cannot predict the future, everyday I speak to someone who says, ""I don't have health insurance, because I am really healthy"".. This statement presumes that the person can see her/his future.  Health Insurance is for the possibility of future claims, purchasing it when you are healthy is important, because when we are not healthy it is impossible to purchase a good plan at a reasonable rate.\n\nEveryday I speak to someone who waits to purchase insurance, and then it is too late.  Here is a dose of reality, automatic declines can including: Diabetes, visiting a chiropractor more than 10times in a 12month period, BMI over 35%, Abnormal Pap test, Asthma combined with any steroid rx, Breast Implants with Silicone, Broken limbs within 90days, the list goes on and on."

771+47=818 mmHg (It is a question of open manometer and the container side has higher pressure than atmosphere because the it is lower than the open end.

It depends on what you mean by a little bit. I would save up  five hundred and go to the county clerks office and get a copy of the property tax list what houses that had tax leins on them or were forclosed. Then go when the auction is scheduled and bid on a house that you want (you can get one for as little as 100 dollars if no one bids higher) fix the house up and 'flip' it. you could sell it outright, rent it out. If you are willing to get in there and get a good deal, it really isn't too good to be true. Give it a try. First step is to go to the county tax clerk office and take a look at the houses and auction dates/times. Good luck."

The Sun does indeed rotate. different part of sun rotates at different time. its like jupiter. \nA rigid body such as the Earth will clearly have a single rotation rate.

"What is as good or better than the 1611 King James Bible for todays english?

Bible translations vary according to readability and tightness of translation.  The more tight the translation the harder it is to read.  This is because there is not a perfect correspondence between languages.  If you are looking for a very readable Bible I'd recommend the GOOD NEWS.  This is available in both Catholic and non-Catholic editions.  The GOOD NEWS was intended to be read easily by those with a 6th grade vocabulary.  The translators did a very good job with it.  I use it often.  On the other end of the spectrum is the NEW OXFORD.  This is not available in a Catholic edition.  For Catholics the tightest translation is probably the NEW JERUSALEM.  The KING JAMES holds an interesting place in history and among Bible translations.  It was not translated with either readability or tightness in mind.  Rather it was translated as an orator's Bible.  It is meant to have a poetic quality, easy to hear and remember.  This is because at the time of it's translation many people were illiterate and few people could afford to own their own Bible.  Another interesting note on the KING JAMES.  It was commissioned by King James of England in part because other then available English translations were biased toward Catholics.  Ironically it is now the Bible of choice for evangelical Christians."

A mammogram would not help you with a lump in this area, as it would be impossible to image.  Go see your doctor.  An ultrasound might be a good place to start.  X-rays would be no good and a CT or MRI is very expensive.  Most of the scans I have performed for this reason turn out to be benign.  Usually, a lump there is attributed to fat distribution.

Just broaden people thinking...you might be just the one to answer the question for the person who need it most....someone seeking but not saying a word.....no matter what faith you are all is welcome in my book...as for me and my house we will serve the lord! Peace to all!!
I think ""Clumsyguy"" has already given you the best answer. The baptism is just the outward expression. In Romans 8 (read it) the holy spirit fell on those who had never been baptised, who only just accepted christ into their hearts. The holy spirit moves only as God wills, Not we ourselves."
"I need a letter to send to a company to threaten to sue them for personal injury?
was eating a danish and it had a hard piece of plactic in it and it broke my tooth. I have spoke with a lawyer and he suggested to send the company a letter.
Your case is probably one in which you should not have a problem finding an attorney to take your case on contingency. If that attorney merely advised you to write a letter to the food service establishment yourself, it does not sound like he was interested in taking your case.\n\nI suggest you retain an attorney who will take your case on contingency and have your attorney write a ""demand letter"" to the food service establishment. The food service place will probably submit your demand to their insurance carrier or corporate attorney for handling.  From there, the respective representatives for both sides will evaluate your injuries and the cost of making you ""whole"" again.\n\nA case such as yours will probably settle, however, I suggest you retain a competent attorney to help you negotiate your damages.  It might be a lengthy process, but at least you have someone on your side advocating for you.  Hope this helps."

"Are wearing of the veil and female circumcision linked by a common attitude to female chastity?
Is it true that female circumcision is a predominantly Islamic phenomenon?  Is there any connection with the practice of wearing the full facial veil which also seems to be motivated by a concern to preserve female chastity?  Likewise honour killings also seem to be motivated by this same attitude.  I also believe that sharia law permits the stoning to death of individuals accused of adultery.  Again highlighting an obsession with female chastity.  I live in Bradford where it is not uncommon to see women walking around in what appears to be a complete body tent several paces behind her husband on the street.  I personally regard all these practices to be mediaeval and oppressive.  Am I wrong to link them to the Islamic culture when instead it is just coincidental that such practices occur in Islamic society?
There is no obsession with female chastity in Islam. True you are to remain a virgin till you are married but that is for men and women. There are several reasons for this, but Islam is not the only religion that promotes staying a virgin till marriage. And as for walking several paces behind there husbands this is a cultural thing, I bet the people you see doing it are either Indian or Pakistani Muslims (not that im saying all are like that ). I walk with my husband taking his arm or holding his hand. I'm a British Muslim, and my husband is an Arab. There are many women out there oppressed and in abusive marriages, that aren't aloud to leave the house without there husband, who are beaten, who are prisoners in there own homes and they are not of any religious denomination at all.  So yes you are wrong to link them to Islamic culture, but they do occur in Islam just like in christian, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant and atheist homes and men who are bullies and women oppressors come from all walks of life, all religions, all countries, all cultures. In Islam women are repected and treated like gold by there husbands, in our homes its the husbands islamic dutie to help 50/50. I for one have never felt more safe and respected. Full face veils are worn by choice there is nothing in Islam that says you have to cover your face and the small percentage of women who do, do so by choice, they do it for God not there husbands."

"recently introduced to 20 year old male. He has four breasts. what is this malady?

It's not really a malady...but he may actually only have 4 nipples, not 4 breasts. They are called auxillary nipples...and it's not as uncommon as you might think. When we're forming, we often have little oddities...some of them self correct as we develop into fetuses, some don't. Look at it this way...when identical twins are made, this is really a fertilized cell that split into 2 separate organisms...now that's much more extreme than an extra nipple or 2."
"how much hydroelectricity can be generated by using a water stream from a 1.5 HP water pump?
the stream is 1 inch and it runs at about a 100 gallons per minute
Well, you can do a lot of figuring with the water, etc, but the quicker way is to just ask the manufacturer of the pump what it's efficiency is. \nConsider the electric motor is probably 90% efficient, the water pump itself might be coupled to about 70% efficiency if it's not cavitating or restricted, so you can maybe (wild guess) get 1 Hp out of the water you are pumping out of the pump. The higher you pump the water, the more loss will add up. If you want electricity, why not use the electricity you are using to run the pump?"

The fact that he is invisible, silent, doesn't respond to any sort of request,you can't feel him or taste him, none of your senses sense him and he cannot be traced by any means except the imagination doesn't seem to impress believers that he actually is not there. \nThat the Bible is an extremely dubious set of edited and fabricated documents with a self-referential endorsement of it'sown authority on the God story  doesn't seem to impress believers that he is not real and there is no God. \nThat nobody ever comes back after they have died doesn't seem to impress believers that there is no afterlife.\nNot a single shred of evidence beyond the anecdotal and hearsay that there is a God.\nI believe he is your imaginary friend."
"how is it different being black living in america?

Mr Curious, what's it like living life as a racist? Given your claimed role as an educator, how do you put your rather mediocre talents to beneficial use. Now, as a Mormon, I don't expect you come into contact with many black students, and those that you do come into contact with should be extremely concerned about the quality of the education you will be providing. By other questions you have ""answered"" you have publicly declared your loathing of Islaam, you have also declared your racist comments and you seem to have an unusual need to keep responding to questions about sex, sexuality and related topics.\n\nYou are clearly a font of knowledge. Being black and living in America (or the rest of the world for that matter) is no fun. The statistical trail of disadvantage suffered by blacks in schools is well established. This is directly correlated to social disadvantage. As a republican you won't understand what that means, but generally it means having less money and advantage than you have. Now, before you steam up and pour out your usual diatribe of nonsense, we know that ""intelligence"" is randomly distributed. We know that socio-economic factors play a disproportionate influence in the life chances of children and we know that blacks have the highest % of socio-economic disadvantage. This means that there is a huge wastage of human potential that this country can barely afford. Don't you think that, as a teacher, you should employ yourself in trying to correct that problem?\n\nOn a final point, you really ought to be ashamed of yourself. You cast a totally unjustified slur on black people (you can't help this as a racist) and it made me wonder how you feel about the ones who have died, in disproportionate numbers to whites, for their country in Iraq? Do they deserve your tirade?"

"Water pressure in a lake?
3.You want to compute the values of the water pressure at various depths below the surface of a lake.  Compute the water pressure at 50 feet below the surface, 100 feet below the surface, and so on down to 500 feet below the surface.  Show the results of your calculations in a table.
The water pressure t a given depth is give as the weight of the water above that depth divided by the area it is being applied.\n\nSo imagine a column of water extending from the top of the lake down the depth.  Calculate the volume of this column of water then using the density of water (1 grams / mL) find the mass.  The take the mass of the water and find its weight (W = mg).  The weight it is the force exerted by the water, but pressure is the force of the water divided by the area it is applied.  So divide the force by the area of the base.\n\nEDIT:\nI see you added the density of water (even though I think my density [1 g/cc] is better).  I will leave you to do your own homework.\n[I also refuse to work with such an ugly unit, I prefer metric]"
"if god is all places all the time then why do we need to goto church or any other holy place to worship him?

Religion is community, faith is individual. We do not need to go to church, or temple, or other place to worship, any more than we need to go to a school to study. It is just an easier way to congregate (pun intended) with people of similar faith.\n\nBecause faith is individual, going somewhere where people have similar values because of their faith allows others to listen and interact, sharing their stories and their troubles with others who can help guide them.\n\nMany people do not attend any services but still consider themselves part of whatever church they belong to. They still follow many of the tenets of their religion, be it Judaism, Christianity (including the Catholic and Protestant churches), Islam, Buddhism, and others. \n\nRemember that you choose what to believe... a place of worship helps cement it."
"Why is evolution such a hard concept for christians to grasp?
It's simple really. There's alot of proof. Actually there's overwhelming proof. How come christians still try and say that it's not true? Why are they afraid of the truth? Why can't they just get with the program already?
You mean creationists, not christians...there are differences.\n\nThey deny it for one reason...it throws enough doubt onto what they believe, that it could shatter the foundation of their belief.  There are some who rationalize the 2 things together, and while I don't agree with trying to merge fact and fiction here, at least they're trying to be logical.  Anyone who believes something so vehemently, that they blind themselves to the truth, usually does it out of fear; whether its a fear of death (believe in a happy afterlife), addiction (do 12 steps, because you didn't CHOOSE to be an addict), accountability (""the devil is why bad things happen to me""), or something else.\n\nHonestly, I'm just as confused as why they would rather come from dirt, than evolve from a living thing myself."

Looks like they're generally worth:\nDenomination/Type  	Series  	Circulated  	Uncirculated\n$1 Silver Certificate 	1935A-1935H, 1957-1957B 	$1.25 	$2.50-$6.00\n\nHowever:\nQ: What exceptions might make my note more valuable?\nA: Star notes, Error notes, and notes with interesting serial numbers are always highly collectable and may increase the value of the note.\n\nQ: What is a STAR Note?\nA: A STAR Note is a note with a STAR (*) in the prefix or suffix position of the serial number. These notes are typically used to replace a note damaged during the printing process to maintain the correct count of notes in a serial number run. Packs of STAR notes are sometimes released when the supply is greater than what's needed. Since STAR notes are much more uncommon, they are prized by collectors.\n\nQ: What is an ERROR note?\nA: From The US Error Note Encyclopedia: ""A Currency Error is any note that does not meet the minimum quality standards of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing but still somehow manages to escape being pulled during the many human and mechanical inspections."" These errors include; cutting errors, folds and tears, inking errors, missing prints, etc. Check your notes and look for anything that's different. For more information on errors, see: The US Error Note Encyclopedia\n\nQ: What is considered an Interesting Serial Number?\nA: Some examples of collectable serial numbers are; low numbers (A00000035A), radar notes which are the same forwards and backwards (A12344321A), 6-8 same digits (A33333333A, A16444444A), special numbers (A00001776A, A19970000A), etc. Basically, any strange or interesting serial number combination is probably collectable and worth more."

"Explain why an object tossed up in a closed moving vehicle lands on the same position?

If the vehicle is moving at a constant speed, then the object is moving forward at that same speed before being tossed. After it is tossed, it continues to move forward at the same speed (as you and the vehicle) because there is nothing to slow it down.\n\nTry tossing the object when the vehicle is accelerating. The object, after being tossed, does not enjoy the acceleration that you and the vehicle do, but instead continues to move forward at the speed it had when tossed, and will land ""behind"" you. This is the principle behind a famous result of Einstein. If the vehicle has no windows, you can't tell whether the vehicle is accelerating, or standing still with ""gravity"" pulling tossed objects toward the back of the vehicle. Even if you try to use a beam of light to determine acceleration or gravity, you will get the same bending of the light beam."

"i have gall stones, should i get my gall bladder removed, after i have my baby?
i am pregnant w stones, should i remove the stones or the gallbaldder...someone told me this is really oddd tough,, if i remove my gallbladder that its a Sin>?? since god created us and we shouldnt remove body parts? im confsed?
Most people with gallstones are asymptomatic (they don't know they have stones).  Pregnant women make more gallstones.  In the facility where I work, we always check the mother's gallbladder when we do an OB ultrasound.  When we do find stones, most women had no idea the stones were there.  They were not experiencing ill effects from it.  If you are not have health complications from the stones, leave them be for not.  If you develop symptoms, you can always have it removed later.  By the say, they do not just remove stones, but they take out the whole gallbladder."
"what are good meditation techniques?

The whole aim of meditation is,\n1. to calm your mind, and\n2. to focus the mind on one thing.\n\nIf you sit down and close your eyes you will notice that your mind is jumping from one thought to another. Even though you want to concentrate on your breath you will find other thoughts also coming in between.\n\nIn learning to meditate you must first learn to calm your mind. You do this by following every thought that comes into you mind. You must be like a Manager of a Hotel who stands at the entrance and observes the customers coming in. Without getting attached to the thoughts try to observe them. You will find that a thought comes in and that it goes nowhere and another thought follows it - try following that too - with same results. This way you will find that your thoughts gradually subside.\n\nOf course do not expect results in one or two days. Practise it for at least 40 minutes every day for at least 2 months you find that you have 'killed' your train of thoughts. I have practised for 1 1/2 years but still vagrant thoughts come in. The whole idea is to silence the mind.\n\nThereafter start concentrating on your breath. Notice the breath coming in and going out. You should not concentrate only on the tip of your nose. Notice the breath coming in and thereafter your lungs getting filled and then gradually exhaling the breath.\n\nYou should be able to get some guidance from the following sites,\n\n1. http://www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm\n2. http://www.meditationexpert.com   and click on the free articles on yoga meditation - it includes articles on all types of meditations including christian and muslim meditation."

"How many facets does a cushion cut diamond have?

A ""Cushion Cut Diamond"" is squarish - rectangular in shape with rounded corners and 58 brilliant-style facets that kind of resembles a pillow in shape, hence the name...  Cushion cut diamonds were developed about a hundred years ago when diamonds were ground down to the desired shape instead of being cleaved or sawn by laser and thus older cushion cut diamonds were lumpy and thick which resulted in blocky patterns of light return which were more or less unimpressive.  As with most diamond shapes, the modern cushion cut diamond has benefited substantially from advancements in diamond cutting and design.  The modern cushion cut diamond is extremely lively and exhibits a high degree of light return."

"why does earth quake occur?

An earthquake is the shaking of the ground caused by an abrupt shift of rock along a fracture in the Earth, called a fault. Within seconds, an earthquake releases stress that has slowly accumulated within the rock, sometimes over hundreds of years. ... \nThe size of an earthquake is indicated by a number called its magnitude. Magnitude is calculated from a measurement of either the amplitude or the duration of specific types of recorded seismic waves. Magnitude is determined from measurements made from seismograms and not on reports of shaking or interpretations of building damage. ... The intensity of and earthquake is a measure of the amount of ground shaking at a particular site, and it is determined from reports of human reaction to shaking, damage done to structures, and other effects. ... \n\nEarth scientists believe that most earthquakes are caused by slow movements inside the Earth that push against the Earth's brittle, relatively thin outer layer, causing the rocks to break suddenly. This outer layer is fragmented into a number of pieces, called plates. Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries of these plates. In Washington State, the small Juan de Fuca plate off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and northern California is slowly moving eastward beneath a much larger plate that includes both the North American continent the land beneath part of the Atlantic Ocean. Plate motions in the Pacific Northwest result in shallow earthquakes widely distributed over Washington and deep earthquakes in the western parts of Washington and Oregon. The movement of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North America plate is in many respects similar to the movements of plates in South America, Mexico, Japan, and Alaska, where the world's largest earthquakes occur. ..."
"A force action on an object does no work if:?
-a machine is used to move the object.\n-the force is not in the direction of the object's motion\n-the force is greater than the force of friction.\n-the object accelerates.\nPlease explain so i can understand this stuff better. Thanks.
Well, basically, the formula of work is Work = Force * Distance\nSo...\n\n1)If a machine is used to move the object while the object is on the machine rather than on the ground, the work is not done on the object, since it does not move... That is to say, relative to the machine, the object remains in the same part of the machine. In this case, the work done is on the machine.\n\n2)If the force is in the oposite direction of the motion of an object, work IS done. Its just that it is negative. That is to say, work is done in stopping the object, so, it has a negative sign.\n\n3)If force is greater than the friction, the object DOES move, so work IS done. If it is less, the object does not move. Thus, no work is done\n\n4)Even if the object accelerates, it is moving, so, work is done"

"My boss is putting me on PIP (personal improvement plan) but I think he is just trying to get rid of me. Help?
Since I started this job 5 months ago, I have gotten VERY little training.  My boss's attention is divided up by two different divisions, and he hasn't had any time to spend with me in the office, or on the road.  He seems to think I have had EXTENSIVE training.  When I asked him what extensive training was, he said it was On The Job training.. that I have been out in the field for 5 months now.  Then I said ""so EXTENSIVE training means that I have been training myself for 5 months?""  He basically said YES, that was my training.  What should I do... I don't want to get fired for some BS like this.  If I go over his head, I know it will just get back to him and I'll end up getting canned anyways.  Help please!
write your boss a letter, keep a copy.\n\nTry to imporove your behavior, too.  If you can change the things that your boss is asking you to do, then fix them.  If not, then write in your letter why you can not.\n\nEventually you will get fired, and you may want to get unemployment benefits until you get a new job.  Then you will show the judge (yes, you will go to court to fight for unemployment benefits) and you will show this letter saying that you are doing the best you can.  Good luck!"

"what style of martial arts did the samurai use in the late 1800's?

The Samurai, per say, were gone by the late 1800's. Many historians tend to believe that the last 'historical' Samurai disbanded in 1877, after the Satsuma Rebellion. Although many solders considered themselves samurai, as do a few individuals today who descend from Samurai families, the Samurai as an official class ceased to exist.  Thus, the ""martial arts"" of post Meiji Restoration (1866 to 1869) would be what has become known as Gendai Budo, or modern martial arts. These arts would include Kendo, Iaido, Jukendo (bayonet fighting) and others.  It would be safe to assume that many of the ex-samurai still practiced the traditional arts (Koryu) such as Aikijujutsu; Sōjutsu (Spear Fighting); kenjutsu (Sword fighting); Iaijutsu (drawing the sword); jojutsu (Short Staff fighting); Taijutsu (Body fighting) and others. However, despite the practicing, Samurai were bnot seen walking the streets of Japan during the end of the 1800's as they had been previously."
"Help Me Plz!!!!?
ok i have a yeast infection (i know it's a yeast infection because it's a light, white discharge, and it does not have an odor) and i'm using monistat3 (u know the 3 day treatment) and i'm also taking AZO...and my question is how long is it going to take for the monistat to cure the infection??? and can the infection come back???
If it is the three day,  I would say about three days then.  Why are you taking the azo?  If it hurts when you urinate you might just have a uti..  Also, there is usually an odor (slightly fishy) when someone has a yeast infection, and the discharge is thick, sometimes curd-like, from a whitish to yellowish color and usually causes itching.  It would be a good thing to visit a doc.  Sure yeast infections can always reoccur.  Some women are prone to having them.  Ease up on the sugary foods if you suspect a yeast infection until you are cleared up."

"What are the odds in relation to thyroid cancer?

What kind of odds are you looking for?  My \nwife had her thyroid removed at age 32.  She was at a 20% chance of cancer due to a nodule on her thyroid.  Most cases we've read about that had some type of cyst or nodule on the thyroid had between a 15%-30% chance of developing cancer.  If thyroid disease was present in family history it increased about 20-30% more.  My wife was lucky and had her thyroid removed before any type of cancer developed.  If you see a lump on your throat, I recommend you get it checked out.  Although it has the highest recovery rate of all types of cancer, its still cancer and should be taken very seriously and treated. The odds of women that will develop some type of thyroid condition is like 6.5 in every 100,000.  There are dozens of books on the subject of thyroid and thyroid disease."

"Linear vs. non-linear equations?
My friend mentioned the phrase ""non-linear equation"" the other day, and I thought what the heck is that.  And if there is a non-linear, then there must be a linear.  What are they and how do they differ?
Generally speaking, you call ""linear"" a function F (or an operator whatsoever) which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1) F(a*X)=a*F(X) for every real number a (X is the argument of the function, whatever it be: it can be a number, a vector, a complex, a function... it doesn't matter)\n\n2) F(X+Y) = F(X)+F(Y) for every X and Y which can be taken as an argument of the function or the operator.\n\nThese two conditions can be sinthesized in the following single one:\n\nCONDITION FOR LINEARITY:\nF(a*X+b*Y) = a*F(X) + b*F(Y) for every a and b reals and for every X and Y in the domain of the function.\n\n----\n\nIn the ring of the polynomials of n variables x1, x2 ... xn, it is easily verified that the only polynomials which can be defined ""linear"" according to the above conditions are those in which the variables appear at the first degree only, so they are in the form:\n\nP(n) = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + an*xn + a(n+1)\n\nLinear equations in n variables are obtained by setting a linear polynomial of the above type equal to 0.\n\nNon-linear equations are all other possible kinds of equations: the ones obteined by setting to 0 non-linear polynomials (you call them algebraic non-linear equations), or the ones obtained by setting ot 0 expressions which involve logarithms, exponentials etc (in that case you are dealing with transcendant equations)"
"how many days or months or years a nuclear submarine can remain in water?

The length of time a nuclear submarine can remain submerged depends upon the amount of provisions stored onboard for the crew.  Storage space reserved for food is limited.  Extra food can be kept anywhere where there is room.  Often, the pathways of berthing are used for canned goods (one walks atop food for several weeks before it's all gone).\n\nOther than the limitation of food, the only other thing that would prevent a nuclear submarine from staying submerged would be air quality.\n\nAn atmosphere monitoring system tests the air (percentages of 02, CO2, CO, etc.) constantly to assure breathable air, while a carbon dioxide scrubber removes Co2 gas; a COH2 burner burns hydrogen (byproduct of the burn is water) and removes CO by passing it over a bed of lithium carbonate.  The scrubbers and the burner work quite well at maintaining safe levels.\n\nWhen the oxygen levels get close to a minimum for safe levels, either the boat ventilates (ship rises to periscope depth and outside air is sucked in with a blower; stale air is exhausted overboard) or it is decided that an oxygen bleed (venting oxygen into the ship from high pressure banks) should be started.  If an oxygen bleed is started, however, it can only continue for a limited time due to the increase in pressure it causes inside the ship; before the pressure increases above acceptable levels (above acceptable levels would cause a human's ear drums to burst and bleed out), the ship must ventilate to equalize with atmospheric pressure.  In case you're wandering, the oxygen aboard ship is actually converted in an oxygen generator from deionized water through a process called electrolysis."
"Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?
Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?
from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our ""fight or flight"" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. <br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the ""fight or flight"" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness.>>"

"How long does it take to create a sandy beach?

There is only one basic source of sand for a beach, and that is from rivers. Secondarily, some beaches are created by ocean currents such as long-shore migration, where the sand is being moved along the shore to spots it may not have been before. \n\nAs far as river deposition, it will vary according to the sediment load of the river. The Mississippi River moves on average about 436,000 tons of sediment in a day. That one day's deposit of sediment probably has enough sand in it to create a fairly nice beach. Since the sand will most likely be deposited in a mouth bar or somewhere else on the delta, it may not be in the form of a beach, but that process is the source of almost all sand on beaches. Even beaches covered with volcanic sediments like in Hawaii still  most often depend on a river or stream to carry the sediment to the beach. In an extreme volcanic eruption a beach of volcanic ash might be deposited in a few hours. \n\nLong-shore drift creates many beaches, and is a relatively slow process. On some coastlines the wave action variation between winter and summer will make some sandy beaches disappear in winter and come back in summer, so in these cases it may only take a few months to create the beach.\n\nThe part of your question that you didn't ask: How long does it take to create the sand on a beach? That answer could be thousands to millions of years, as rock such as granite has to be weathered and eroded to create the sand grains that make up most sand."

I learned too...not to aim it straight toward the tooth: In other words, for #14, raise it slightly higher than the upper jaw, then aim downward toward the tooth. That way, you get a decent shot of the roots too. You don't crop the xray, leaving only the tooth visible on the film. Kinda hard to expain without showing someone in person...But nah, you'll get it.

"what is the most violent storm on earth?

From the various reading I've done on this subject, as well as the educational programming I've watched about it, I'd say that all things considered, a volcanic eruption, like that of the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa, is by far the most violent and has the most and the longest-lasting consequences not only on the area in which the volcano erupted and the area the lava reached, and not only the areas affected by the resulting tsunamis, its effect actually includes the entire planet, since such an eruption is violent enough to change the entire planet's climate!\n\nWith a volcanic eruption you have: rocks of all sizes, including those the size of houses, hurled out like torpedoes, hot lava that incinerates everything in its path, hot gasses that not only expand, creating a pressure front, not only also incinerate, but also form acids that dissolve the various objects in their path, massive earthquakes, massive tsunamis and last, but most certainly not least, a thick cloud of ash, particles and gasses that wreak utter havoc with the atmosphere and the planet's general climate, thus disrupting wind currents, ocean currents and the general climatic-atmospheric signature of the planet. Consequently, even those places that were nowhere near the volcano, nowhere near the radius of the area the lava will reach, nowhere near any coast that would be affected by the resulting tsunamis, it will still be affected by the falling rocks and debris, which were spewed up into the atmosphere, as well as by the climatic disruptions.\n\nTo my knowledge, not even earthquakes, regardless how violent, can match that level of and extent of destruction, despite the fact that they cause massive fires and potent tsunamis!\n\n\nNote: I took a very ""flexible"" interpretation of the word storm. I took it to mean any weather/climatic phenomenon/activity. Thus, in that sense, a volcanic eruption can be interpreted as a storm, even though it is not a current of air or water or both!  But, then again, if that type of climatic activity is not to be considered a storm, then what else can it be called? It is ludicrous to lump wind & water weather events together under the title storm, yet consider volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis & mudslides, to name a few, categories & titles in of themselves!"

This is a word problem that I can't figure out for the life of me. Thanks!
Here is an answer using mathematics and not deduction, fits all ages and knowledge levels! Ha ha!\n\nLet's denote the amount of 50's by X and the amount of 20's by Y. If she has 32 bills in total, that means X and Y add up to 32. That gives one equation ===> X+Y=32\nThen, total amount of money is 1000, and that is made up of X amounts of 50's and Y amounts of 20's. And that gives us the second equation =====> 50X+20Y=1000 Using simultaneous equation we have....\nX+Y=32 ====> Multiply this by 50 for simplifcation\n50X+20Y=1000\n\nThe new equation from multiplying by 50 will be \n\n50X+50Y=1600     Now simply subtract one from the other\n50X+20Y=1000\n-------------\n0 + 30Y = 600 ======> Y=600/30=20\n\nTherefore, if she has 20 20's and in total if she has 32 bills, she naturally have 12 50's!"

"Does anyone know any prayers by Michelangelo? Was he even Christian?
I'm curious as to whether or not he was even Christian...I'm pretty sure he is. Does anyone know of any prayers he spoke/wrote?
Yes, Michelangelo was a very dedicated Catholic. You see he was commissioned to do many Catholic works of art, but it was up to him to lay out the paint and include the minute details.  You should read up on some of the beautiful inclusions he left in the biblical stories he would paint. He put his heart for Christ and his meditations on God into his art which are truly fascinating.\n\nThink of, for instance, the Last Judgement and look at the face of Christ and the stance of Peter who holds the keys.  There is an amazing interplay of emotion and speaks profoundly on the artists concept of the relationship the two had.\n\nOnly God creates. The rest of us just copy.\n\nLord grant that I may always desire more than I can accomplish.\n\nthese are the only two I can remember, but I am sorry they are not much of prayers from him.\n\np.s.

"What is the cirumference of the circle?
Suppose you have a checkers board with red and black squares, each square measuring 5 cm by 5 cm.\n\nWhat's the largest circle that can be drawn on the board such that the entire circumference of the circle is only touching black?
well nice question\n\nThe largest circle would be one that had its centre point in the centre of a white square and it runs through the black squares around it. It starts through the corner of one black square and goes through the square and continues through to the next black square joined by the corners.  \n\nThe diameter of the circle would be  d = SQRT(5^2+5^2)\n         Where SQRT means square root of (   )\n                and ' ^ ' means to the power of.\nd= 7.07 cm\n\nTherefore the circumference =(pi)*(d)\n\nCirc. = 22.21\nHope it helps"
"If you already know Spanish and English, what other easy language should you learn?

Knowing Spanish, it would be easy enough to learn any other Romance language...Italian, French, others. Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, and not sure, but there may be a third dialect that is used only in Spain...vosotros Spanish but maybe that is Portuguese. My guess is that pure aesthetics aside, though, (since all these languages have their own beauty) if you are faced with anything in a romance language and you already know one, you can figure out a lot of what you need to know in the others. IF your motive is purely to communicate with a wide variety of people.\n\nGerman doesn't seem all that hard and opens up another family of languages called the Germanic...which kind of stack on one another and learning one helps you learn another. German, Dutch, Yiddish, and the Scandanavian languages. \n\nIf you were traveling anywhere in W Europe, I would say that Spanish and German would help you a great deal.  \n\nBut if you really want to understand more about language, including English, learn LATIN. It will help you understand almost any language. It is what the romance languages are based on, if I'm not mistaken, and helps decipher the roots of many words.\n\nIf you are Catholic and want to understand the roots of your church better, learning Latin will be the key to that. And Latin in sacred music is absolutely beautiful.\n\nIf you want to study other languages that help you with Judeo Christian faith, try Greek, Hebrew, and again, Latin. If you are some other faith, study the language that was being used by the people who started that religion.\n\nFor pure fun, there are groups dedicated to studying Tolkien languages. Elvish and its dialects, Dwarvish, and I'm sure there are others. Tolkien was a linguistics professor. He created all the elements of Middle Earth, including the races, their histories, and their languages, LONG before the Lord of the Rings came out."

"What vitamans/meds are good for weightloss?
I am running ragged right now and don't have any time to excersize. I need alittle help with lossing weight and it doesnt help that the antidepressant I am on makes me want to eat.
Keep in mind the following when wanting to lose weight:\n\nDiets and changing your eating to healthy food choices  can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called ""emotional eating"" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.\n\nYou may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. \n\nThis all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. \n\nPlease learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:\n\nYou already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually you’ll see the pounds come off. What’s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same “Emotional Eating.” Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, that’s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesn’t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we don’t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.\n\nP.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost."
"Diet Pills?

If you eat regularly, don't worry about it, some of us have faster metabolism's than others. I am underweight to but I eat normally, everyones born different, and one day it will catch up to you anyway, whether you think your too skinny, someone else may think your perfect, or if you think your just right, someone may think your overweight. No matter what you're not going to make everyone happy, theres always going to be people with different opinions, I think people need to mind there own business.

Am i normal? i weigh 45kg and im 1m63, my doctor told me im underweight rencently... im even on the pill which helped my boobs, i have to wear padded bras and i feel as if i'm cheating , i even have a boyfriend who ive been with almost two yrs who loves me to bits and doesnt understand why i'm so depressed... but again he only sees me wearing padded bras... my mum and aunts all have size C and biggerrr...and its meant to be hereditary\ndoes anyone have the same problem? or any advice?\nThanks so much
Being underweight can affect that, just as when someone loses weight, the first thing to go are your boobs! I don't think there is anything wrong with you. At 18, you are still growing. You don't want huge boobs anyway - they just get in the way! Give yourself a few years to finish growing and see what happens. In the meantime, don't worry about it. Trust me, there are worse problems! p.s. They will NOT grow with regular sex - the person who said that is wrong! And puberty is not brought on by your weight either. Duh."

"Hi , Just wondering what is the highest credit score?

Scores range from the 300s to about 900, with the vast majority of folks falling in the 600s and 700s. The higher the score, the better. \n\n""The FICO score is the single best summary score of one's credit worthiness,"" says E-Loan President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Kennedy. \nA credit score number is often called a FICO score, for Fair, Isaac and Co., the California company that developed the system upon which it is based. \nThe score is supposed to distill all the information in your credit report, using a formula to calculate a single number that indicates your credit worthiness. \nIt's designed to give lenders a fast, accurate prediction of the risk involved in giving you a loan. Lenders have attested to the score's value in streamlining the underwriting process and creating more opportunities for consumers to get mortgages."
"Why do we always do things that we know aren't good for us and yet we still do them?

"Is there a major (or a minor) in college for photography???  Also, what jobs are there for phtography???  HELP
I want to do something in life dealing with photography.  Yes, I'm only 14, but this is a huge hobby that I have found interest in.  I want to know if there is a well paying job out there that involves phtography. (e.g. senior pictures, family portraits)  Also, would it be smart to get a major in something else, that way I have a back-up plan??  I really love to take pictures and I'm very interested in this.  If anyone knows anything about this, please tell me.  Thanks.
There are plenty of schools out there that offer photography courses, major and minor.  I attended the Art Institute of Ft. Lauderdale majoring in photography.  The Art Institutes are located all over the country.  But that's just one.  Even some community colleges offer this course.  As for jobs, where do I start!  It depends on what type of photography you're into.  If you love to do sr. pics and family, you can start out in any retail studio like The Picture People, Sears, JcPenny, these allow you to start out with out any professional experience and offers paid training, which is good to do to get some experience.  Photography is so broad, you can do whatever you want!  Try freelance jobs also.  Even once you have the funds or the ability to apply for loans, start your own business!!  Just be careful because starting your own business can be risky, so be sure to take some business courses too."
"Do you think that there is a God out there?

Take a look at the amazing universe all around you - The galaxies, stars and planets... the beauty of mountains and trees and everything that lives, grows and breathes on the Earth.  No sane person believes that the great complexity of the natural universe in general and living organisms in particular could just exist fully formed with no cause and no origin.\n\nSo, how can any sane person possibly believe that all this amazing complexity is sourced in an intelligent designer who just exists fully formed with no cause and no origin?  That would be completely absurd.  The only possible explanation is that the universe had a natural origin, and that the order and complexity we observe in the universe has arisen over billions of years from simplicity and chaos by the effect of unthinking, undirected natural processes.  Science, in the form of cosmology and biology, shows us that this is indeed the case.\n\nThe idea of a creator god has no explanatory value - It is intellectual laziness, a non-answer, not a solution to the question of existence but a way of avoiding the question.  It should and will be consigned to history along with all our other naive superstitious beliefs."

I'm just not all that happy about these areas what exercises can I do in my own time to get a better fit. I'm tired of trying to find jeans to fit me. Please respond I need to know.
Do not be fooled there is no such thing as spot reducing. You cannot pick and choose where on your body you want to tone and shape. Genetics combined with a healthy diet and exercise, and environmental factors do that. \nI personally have exercises I do with clients that work the glutes, since this is such a popular area for people in exercising.\n\nLunges - forward motion and reverse stationary lunges. Make sure you keep your kneecaps from extending over your toes\n\nBuy a theraband - to wrap around your ankles and then walk side to side (unbelievable burn from that)\n\nSlow motion squat - feet shoulder with apart squat with dumbbells in each hand or one heavier dumbell with both hands between your legs (spread a little wider). Its slow motion so down slowly , hold once you reach the point where your hamstrings are almost parallel to the ground then hold 2 seconds then come up. Make sure you keep your kneecaps from extending over your toes.... very nice burn.\n\nleg press - slowly down - hold - then up . I got a few more but I would have to show you... they are more complicated.\n\nOk dont get the wrong impression, this wont tone your glutes and hips, its these in combination with \na healthy diet and fitness that work together toward a healthy lifestyle. Changing your diet and your level of fitness is what can change the way you look and feel. The best way to lose weight is about living a healthier life than what you may be living now. You will need a complete lifestyle change and you will need to be committed. \n\n\nCheck my source for a good plan to follow (save some typing).\n\nhttp://www.jtfit.com/lose-weight"

"Can you ever read your own thoughts?
Or is it like the Heisenberg Uncertainity principle?\nAs soon as you start observing your thoughts they change? So in effect you can never really observe your present thoughts but you can remember the old ones.
This is a very interesting topic. It's like how you can hear yourself say something in your mind, but you don't actually hear sound. Or how you see a certain image when your eyes are open (hence, daydream). It's difficult to observe thoughts as they are happening, since the only way to actually formulate an opinion about what we are thinking is to analyze what we remember thinking. It's pretty amazing how our minds work, and what they control. We can't (more accurately, MOST of us can't) voluntarily control the rate of our heart beat, but we can voluntarily control our breathing. Yet, when we are asleep or not paying attention, our brain's nervous system takes over. It's so amazing...\n\nI can go on about this forever! : ) I actually have never heard of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle but I'll look into it. (After a pause...)

"Do you think giving up 2 addictions together is too risky?
I managed to stop drinking 9 months ago but I still smoke. I enjoy smoking most of the time and I have had advice off cousellors(6 months ago) not to try to quit too much at once.

I would carry on smoking for a while.  You've done fantastically well to stop drinking and you should be really proud of yourself.  I stopped smoking 2 years ago, I've never relapsed but it is hard, especially for the first few months and if you try to  give up too soon after you stopped drinking you could possibly end up relapsing on both counts.  Unless you have any serious health problems where smoking puts you in immediate danger, I honestly think you should forget about stopping for another year or so. I hope everything works out for you."
"What is smoke made of?
I`ve heard it`s something to do with incomplete combustion.Real answers please?
Smoke is a suspension in air (aerosol) of small particles resulting from incomplete combustion of a fuel. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves and lamps) and fireplaces, but may also be used for pest control (cf. fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defense (smoke-screen) or inhalation of tobacco or other drugs. Smoke is also sometimes a component of internal combustion engine exhaust gas, particularly diesel exhaust."

"characteristics of the hotel industry?

Well...I've been a Night Manager at a hotel for a bit over five years. So I definitely consider myself an insider. Okay...as with any aspect of the hospitality/service industry, it is a lot different behind the scenes than it is out front. Often you will find hotels are understaffed, underpaid and underfunded. And I'm not being critical -you'll most likely find that to be the norm anywhere, from the grandest five star to the sleaziest motel. Generally the owners invest, but they don't want to spend anymore than they have to. I have quite a few acquaintances in the biz; we often compare notes and this is pretty much the standard. It's amazing how many hotel owners and accountants are unfamiliar with that old maxim, ""It takes money to make money"", because they always seem to be whinging about how business could be better but they don't want to invest the money into making the improvements. Catch 22. Beyond that, housekeeping is the most thankless job in a hotel. Housekeepers see a lot; they also have to clean up some unholy messes and usually don't get even a thank you. Mind you, you'll also find some guests are big tippers, but these are more often than not the exception to the rule. Hotel employees in general see a lot, as you can imagine; you get all sorts of people as guests, and a lot tends to go on up in those rooms. And again that rule applies across the board. \nAs a five year veteran of the business, it never ceases to amaze me how many guests blatantly try to insult the intelligence of the front desk agents. People will try ANYTHING to get a deal, refund or a comp. People will lay any kind of story on you they can to get a room so they can carry out all sorts of illegal activities. I've personally been bribed to rent to unsavoury kinds of people so many times...but I can't be bought. Mind you, at our particular establishment we take security pretty seriously, and, as the night guy, that most often comes down to me.\nI know, a lot of what I've said must sound like I'm awfully jaded and cynical, but it's true. Don't get me wrong, I love my job (otherwise I wouldn't be doing it) but working in the hotel industry can be pretty thankless. But I believe in giving travellers good, inexpensive decent quality accommodation; that's why I'm here. However, the reality of the hotel industry is that though most hotels claim a ""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"", on a good day they can maybe manage 70%. A lot of it comes down to the bean counters though, and unfortunately they can be notoriously tight with the bucks when they want to be. Trouble is, this is most often when the hotel needs the bucks the most (renovations, advertising, etc...)\nI wish your question was a bit more specific...get a hold of me if you need more (specfic) details..."

"Friction coefficient?
The friction coefficient between an athelete's ahoes and the ground is 0.90 . Suppose a superman wears these shoes and races for 50 m. There is no upper limit on his capacity of running at high speeds . What will be the minimum time that he will have to take in completing the 50 m starting from rest ?
Start with the formula, F = ma.  The force, F,  he is able to exert is equal to his weight times the coefficient of friction.  And his weight is his mass times the acceleration of gravity.  So, F = 0.9mg, and 0.9mg = ma.  Mass is on both sides, so it cancels.  0.9g = a, 0.9*9.81 m/s^2 = 8.83 m/s^2.  His final velocity, Vf = SQRT(Vi^2 + 2ad), where Vi is his initial velocity (zero), a is his acceleration, and d is the distance he travels.  So, Vf = SQRT(2*8.83*50) = 29.71 m/s.  Because his acceleration is constant, his average velocity is 29.71/2 = 14.86 m/s.  The time he takes is then d/Vave = 50/14.86 = 3.365 s."
"do you forgive your children all of their wrong doings, even if they don't ask to be forgiven?
and in doing so, does this make you a more loving parent then god?
I don't feel the need to forgive my children for anything. I don't think they do anything to personally hurt me. They do what they do for their own reasons. I am not one of those parents that think everything is about me. I remember what it was like being a child and I try to give them the space to learn their own lessons. I also try to remember how it felt to be on the receiving end of parents guilt and I don't guilt my kids. Even in grounding them we make it an open discussion. Since I am God I guess we are equal as loving parents. I know this Q wasn't put out for people like me more for those that think God is casting sinners into hell. I just like answering your questions.\nLove & Light\nSharon"
"Are we like gods yet?
In the bible it says near the end of days we will be like gos. So far a bunch of the other prophecies have come true. like the new state of isrel and russia having a nuke or powerfull weapon but I just saw a guy on T.v. who is paralized who had some wires connected to his brain and now he can control t.v.'s computers and prostetic arms but does this qualifiy us as gods?
The human race is more powerful than ever before. We have the power of flight,space travel to the moon and the nearest planet,we can make our own heat and light from harnassing energy at will.As for the man you described,maybe the technology that provides him with the ability to use brain waves to control aspects of the world around him is a step away from godlike power.\n I'm sure that to the ancients who lived in the time of Christ we would seem to be as powerful as gods-but that doesn't make us gods. We will always have human frailties."
"Does Anyone Believe That The Jehovah's Witnesses Have The TRUTH?
I Believe It And I Am Just Wondering How Many People Have Been In Contact With A Witness?
Yes I do believe that JWs have the ""Truth"" and that's why I decided to dedicate my life to Jeohvah. The Bible says the following of those who would be true Christians. ""If the world hates YOU, YOU know that it has hated me before it hated YOU. If YOU were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because YOU are no part of the world, but I have chosen YOU out of the world, on this account THE WORLD HATES YOU."" (John 15:17) 1 Peter 4:4 say these words, ""because YOU do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of YOU.""  And both scriptures prove to be true in regards to JWs.  I read comments on here that people have posted and they criticize us and trash us about things that aren't even true.  Or then we are criticized for following Bible commands.  Now what sense does that make?  The only fact that some have is that we go door to door.  But then you have people that of course make up things about that also.  And so ones continue to be puzzled about us without taking time to learn what is true.  And then there are the ones who may have some accurate knowledge, but since JWs DO NOT break or bend Bible principals to fit someone's individual lifestyle then they're mad and they then want to speak abusively of us.  And Oh, my, there are the one who study and study up on us just to find any little mistake.  And if they find one or what they believe to be one because maybe they don't understand then they want to bash us.  We have never said that we were perfect, but the same people who say we DON'T have the ""TRUTH"" they expect us to be perfect.  But regardless to what ones may say, think, or do. We continue to serve Jehovah with our whole heart, soul and mind.  We continue to worship him with spirit and truth.  We continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom.  We contiue to help ones come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.  We continue to hold our integerity and remain steadfast. We follow Jesus' commands and his wonderful examples.  And so YES I know with all my heart and everything in me that Jehovah's Witnesses indeed have the TRUTH!"
"Does drinking milk help or hinder you losing weight?
On biggest loser last night they were talking up the benefits of milk helping you lose weight, 8 oz a day of 2% every day, but every diet plan I've ever seen that's the first thing they take out, anything dairy is ""forbidden""!\n\nAnyone out there with professional opinions on this, or a successful dieter who found a glass of milk a day actually helped with the weight loss?
I found this article quite informative:\n\nLink between dairy, weight loss unclear:\n    Few others endorse findings of National Dairy Council and its researchers\n\nGot milk? And high hopes it will help you shed a few pounds? The dairy industry is counting on it, thanks in part to a $200 million ad campaign that confidently touts studies suggesting a connection between consuming dairy products and losing weight. But dieters might want to delay sporting milk mustaches for the moment.\n\nThough the National Dairy Council and the researchers it pays stand by their claims, few others have endorsed the dairy-diet link. Even some scientists whose research supports that idea say its conclusions are premature.\n\n""The bulk of the studies suggest a possible role, but there are inconsistencies in the data,"" said Dr. David Ludwig, an obesity expert at Children's Hospital Boston. In a 2002 study, he found that dairy aided weight loss.\n\n""My concern is the advertising claims by the Dairy Council have well outstripped the available data,"" he said.\n\nThose claims have received wide attention since 2003, when a coalition of dairy groups launched what has become the ""3-A-Day"" campaign, which advises that three servings a day of dairy supports weight loss.\n\nThe federal government also recommends three dairy servings a day, but doesn't support the weight-loss claim.\n\nThe dairy campaign is based on research by Michael Zemel, a nutrition professor at the University of Tennessee who began studying the link between dairy and weight during the late 1980s. Since 2000, he has published several studies that found people who eat a lower-calorie diet and consume the recommended low- or non-fat dairy servings lose nearly twice the weight as those who only cut calories.\n\nBut his research often is misunderstood, Zemel says. It is not a case of drink milk, lose weight. It works only for people who eat a low-calorie diet and who are not already consuming three servings of dairy.\n\nThat's a bit more nuanced than the ""Lose More Weight"" and ""Burn More Fat"" emblazoned across the packaging of a growing array of dairy products, though Zemel says the industry's claims accurately represent his findings.\n\nNuanced or not, the claims seemed like good news to Pam Syms, a 50-year-old Concord, N.H., woman who loves dairy and wants to lose a little weight.\n\nSince seeing the industry's television ads a few weeks ago, Syms has brought yogurt to work every day. So far, no change in her weight, but she's happy for an excuse to eat dairy without guilt.\n\n""Since I do like dairy products so much, it was just an affirmation that, 'Yes, I can keep eating those things,'"" said Syms, who admits that, nevertheless, she's skeptical of the claims.\n\nSo was Zemel. He said that in 1988 when he made the first surprising connection between dairy and weight loss, ""I couldn't get behind it without more data. By 2005, I feel we have that data.""\n\nSo does Greg Miller of the National Dairy Council. The industry waited years before launching its campaign, he said, wanting first to amass enough studies to ensure solid scientific footing.\n\nAmong those studies are a handful of randomized clinical trials, often considered the ""gold standard"" of science. All were funded by the Dairy Council, and most involved Zemel, who has received nearly $2.1 million from the group since 1998.\n\nZemel also has patented the claim that dairy boosts weight loss, meaning every company that uses a ""Slim Down with Yogurt"" or similar logo has to pay him and his university. Since 2000, the patent has generated about $500,000, half of which goes to Zemel and two other patent holders.\n\nBut it's not Zemel's science that has been criticized _ it's the dairy industry's conclusions from it.\n\n\n\nHope this helps! ;-)"
"What causes mechanical energy?

The study of mechanics concerns the motion of physical bodies and the forces that act upon them. Most people are familiar with systems described by Newtonian mechanics - objects that sit around, move, collide, and are influenced by gravity. Mechanical energy includes things like the kinetic energy of a moving billiard ball, or the potential energy a roller coaster at the top of its track.\n\nThe physics of electromagnetism were not understood at the time of Newton, but in some situations, the mechanics (i.e. the mathematics of motion) of bodies influenced by electromagnetic forces is the same as that of those influenced by gravity. For example, two particles of opposite electrical charge experience an attractive force which is (allowing for certain idealizations) mathematically identical to the gravitational forces two passing planets experience. An electromechanical system might also involve the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical charges or magnetic fields, or vice versa.\n\nEveryday objects are composed of atoms and molecules, which to some degree, are like billiard balls that are constantly bouncing off one another. ""Mechanical energy"" might include the kinetic energy of these particles, or potential energy stored in the physical arrangement. For example, a compressed solid exerts pressure because electromagnetic forces between particles tend to push them apart. Compressing a solid (moving the particles ""uphill"" against repulsive electromagnetic forces) stores potential energy in a similar way that pushing a boulder up a hill does (moving the object uphill against the attractive gravitational force of the Earth). On the other hand, a compressed gas exerts pressure because independently moving particles collide with the walls of the container and change direction. The particle is accelerated (its velocity vector changed), and the acceleration times the mass of the particle gives the force applied. Compressing a gas changes the average kinetic energy of the particles, which is reflected in the corresponding increase in the temperature of the gas. The pressure also increases, but this is because the same number of particles have been forced into a smaller volume, so they collide more often with the walls. The force of any given collision is the same, but the number of collisions has increased.\n\nPotential energy does play a role in the pressure of a gas. During an individual collision, a gas molecule comes closer to the molecules of the container wall. The electric fields exert a force on the molecule, slowing it down and reducing its kinetic energy. This energy is temporarily stored as potential energy. Soon, the particle is nearly stationary (if it happened to approach head on), or at least, it is not approaching the wall any more. The electric fields continue to exert a force on the gas molecule. The force continues to change the velocity, and soon the molecule is moving away from the wall and gaining kinetic energy. Generally, the collision is elastic, and all of the kinetic energy is recovered and the particle continues moving with the same speed it had originally.\n\nSolid mechanics studies how rigid bodies behave in response to external forces. Fluid mechanics studies the internal motion of liquids, gases, and other forms of matter. Mechanical energy can be expended in crushing a soda can, affecting the motion and positional arrangement of its component reioufdgkljh kjhfbkjh ael;hgfljh wajh kjfrom the molecules of a solid to the molecules of a liquid when, for example, a glass of water is stirred.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below..."

"Anyone know about biblical/religious numerology??
I think it was in a book by Herbert Armstrong...3 representing the trinity, 4 the earth, 6 mankind, 7 perfection...any info??
Here r some numbers:\n1 THE NUMBER OF UNITY. Father. Deuteronomy 6:4 ""Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Ephesians 4:5 ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism.""  \n2 THE NUMBER OF DIVISION. The Son who has two natures: human and divine. There are 2 Testaments: the Old and New. Man is Male and Female. Rom. 9 speaks of two vessels: one for honorable use and the other for dishonorable use. Two types of people: Sheep and Goats. There are two ages, this age and the age to come: Matt. 12:32; 13:39,40,49; Mark 10:30.  \n3 THE NUMBER OF DIVINE PERFECTION. The Trinity consists of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. There are three qualities of the universe: Time, Space, and Matter. To exist (except for God), all three are required. Each quality consists of three elements. Therefore, we live in a trinity of trinities. \n4 THE NUMBER OF CREATION - North, South, East, West; 4 Seasons. The 4th commandment is the first that refers to the earth. The 4th clause of the Lord's Prayer is the first that mentions the earth. The materials of the tabernacle were four and so were the coverings and the ornamentations.  \n5 THE NUMBER OF GRACE. Redemption. Israel came out of Egypt 5 in rank (Ex 13:18). David picked up 5 smooth stone to fight Goliath (1 Sam. 17:40). The Holy Anointing Oil was pure and composed of 5 parts (Ex. 30:23-25).  \n6 THE NUMBER OF MAN: Man was created on the 6th day. Man labors 6 days only. The Serpent was created on the 6th day. The 6th commandment is ""Thou shalt not murder."" Six words are used for man: Adam, ish, Enosh, gehver, anthropos, anar. Also, 6 x 6 = 36. 36 + 35 + 34 + 33 + 32 . . . 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 666. 666 is the number of the antichrist. This means that the name of the antichrist in Greek adds up to 666. This is a mockery of the Trinity.  \n7 THE NUMBER OF SPIRITUAL PERFECTION. Seven days in a week. Seven colors in the spectrum. Seven of the 10 commandments begin with the word ""not."" There are 7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 parables in Matthew, and 7 promises to the churches \n8 THE NUMBER OF NEW BEGINNINGS. 8 people on Noah's Ark (2 Pet. 2:5); circumcision on 8th day (Gen. 17:12); God made 8 covenants with Abraham \n9 THE NUMBER OF JUDGMENT. There are 9 greek words derived from the root word meaning judgment = dikay. The following words each occur 9 times in the Bible: abussos (bottomless pit); asebee (ungodly); aselgeia (lasciviousness); and astrapee (lightning). The gifts of the spirit are 9 in number (1 Cor. 12:8-10): the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues, and interpretation of tongues.  \n10 THE NUMBER OF DIVINE PERFECTION. There are 10 commandments (Ex. 20); 1/10 of your income is a tithe; the were 10 plagues on Egypt (Ex. 9:14ff); 10 x 10 silver sockets formed the foundation of the Tabernacle (Ex 38:27); There are 10 ""I AM's spoken by Jesus in John: 1) I am the Bread of Life (6:35); 2) I am the Bread of Life which came down from heaven (6:41); 3) I am the Living Bread (6:51); 4) I am the Light of the world (8:12); 5) I am One that bears witness of Myself (8:18); 6) I am the Door of the sheep (10:7,9); 7) I am the Good Shepherd (10:14); 8) I am the Resurrection and the Life (14:6); 9) I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life (11:25); and 10) I am the True Vine (15:1,5). \n12 THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTAL PERFECTION. There were 12 tribes of Israel; 12 Apostles, 12 foundations in the heavenly Jerusalem; 12 gates; 12 pearls; 12 angels. The measurements of New Jerusalem are 12,000 furlongs or stadia, while the wall will be 144 (12 x 12) cubits (Rev. 21:16-17).  \n40 THE NUMBER OF PROBATION OR TRIAL. The Israelites wandered for 40 years (Deut. 8:2-5). Moses was on the mount for 40 days (Exodus 24:18); 40 days of Jonah and Nineveh (Jonah 3:4). Jesus was tempted for 40 days (Matt. 4:2).  \n153 In John 21:11, after the resurrection the disciples caught 153 fish. The word fish in Greek is 'ixthus&#39"
"My employer continues to lose money onour pension plan?
Is there anyway we can sue them for the balance or take control for ourselves?
You should always have a separate retirement fund besides your pension plan.  Many pensions are underfunded now because companies can borrow from them.  Go start a Roth IRA somewhere.  If it were me, I'd find a mutual fund with a very low expense ratio, and one that tracks a major index, like the Dow or the S&P 500.\n\nAs to whether you can sue - I'd take your question to your state's attorney general's office.

"bible vs SCIENCE  WHY ???

that's a perfect topic, too many scientific errors in the bible, too many to include. i'll state one for now:\n\nPro 6:6  You lazy people can learn by watching an anthill. \nPro 6:7  Ants don't have leaders, \n  \n\nants don't have leaders? what about the ant queen?\ni bet who ever wrote the bible didn't know that ants are highly organized beings.\n\n\nEDIT***\ni forgot my favorite error. earth has 4 corners:\n\nRev 7:1  After this I saw four angels. Each one was standing on one of the earth's four corners. The angels held back the four winds, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. These angels had also been given the power to harm the earth and the sea. Then I saw another angel come up from where the sun rises in the east, and he was ready to put the mark of the living God on people. He shouted to the four angels,"

"48 yr old male has open hrt surgery has kidney and liver fail,developed burnt like chars on hand and feet why?
My husband has been in criticle condition for the past 18 days now I understand about the liver and kidneys failing as part of the risk with open heart procedures, what I dont understand is why are his feet and one hand black and seems to have a charred like appearance. No one seems to beable to give me a straight answer,  I wonder if I sould take this to another level?  Was it human error? Was it medication? I dont understand, how does a strong, vital and otherwise healthy young man go in for a risky yet very common procedure and wind up looking as he does, he is on a trach and unable to move, talk  or function up to this point.  How was this possible, he's confused I'm confused I hope there is someone who can shed some light on this - also his extremities are very pain full and there are blisters forming.  Thank you for your responses.
If your husband has been on IV medications, called vasopressors, to keep his blood pressure from getting too low this can cause a decrease in peripheral circulation.  The medications cause the vessels to constrict to keep the BP at an appropriate level.  Because of this, the circualtion to the limbs, most often hands and feet, is inadequate.  Most likely this is the reason his feet and hand appear this way.  Unfortunately this is more common than we'd like to admit.  Once this damage is done a lot of times there is no way to reverse it as well.  The blisters may be forming due to excessive fuid in the tissues, called edema.  And once again, fluids in higer volumes may be given to elevate his blood pressure as well.  This is also one of those things that is necessary.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me.  I am a RN, working in a Cardiac Surgery ICU and I see this happen.  Please, do not give up hope, I have seen people recover from situations like this.  The best thing you can do is ask questions when you have them, and have the faith that your husbands physicians are doing their best to care for him.  Best of luck to you and your husband!"
"How can I remedy a sore back?

Well, it depends whether it's just a pain due to muscle spasms or whether you actually pinched a nerve in your back. If you can touch your toes, then it's most likely a muscle problem. If you get extreme pain to try to touch your toes, then it could be a nerve problem. In both cases you need to see a doctor. If it's a muscle problem, the doctor will give you pain killers and muscle relaxants. Heating the area is useful. You can try dipping yourself in a bath tub full of warm water. Good luck."

Ahhhhhhh...A fledgling Amateur Astronomer!!...WONDERFUL!!\n\nThe first and foremost thing to consider is APERTURE..This is the SIZE of the opening of the telescope...The reason is, except for the moon, astro objects are dim...the larger the aperture, the more LIGHT will be gathered and focused into your eyepiece, so the clearer the image and the higher magnification you can use without blurring.\n\nYou mention a price range of $2000...That much money will buy a GREAT telescope, however, I suggest you start with a less expensive Dobsonian telescope for your first purchase.\nThis will give you some experience, HOURS of enjoyment, and will let you see if you are REALLY interested enough to upgrade to a more expensive piece. Dobsonians ( or NEWTONIAN...Same principle, REFLECTORS ) of good quality can be purchased on E-bay for around $300-$500.\n\nIn the $2000 range, look for a 'Schmitt-Cassegrain' with ' Go-To' electronics...Readily available"
"Did I have heatstroke?  Or just simply overheated?
Earlier this evening I was working at the Mexican Grill.  It is on campus so it is just a small kitchen area with a grill, steam tables, quesodilla machine, etc.  and very very hot!!!  \n\nThe AC isn't on yet and we were all taking quick water breaks inbetween customers.  Well, I was cutting a quesidilla and suddenly became very light-headed and stumbled.  Part of me wanted to give in and fall, but the other half knew I would probably throw the knife somewhere and hit my head bad.\n\nI told my boss I was going to go sit down. She brought over water and orange juice.  She said I looked really red.  She then sent me outside with a damp towel around my neck and more water.  \n\nI was sitting out by the trash and could not smell a thing.  Soon, I became very cold and started shivering when everyone else was still burning up.\n\nMy boss felt my cheeks and forhead.  She said I must have a fever but the rest of me was clammy.  I was sent home.  \n\nI feel slightly better now.
Definitely heat exhaustion. Heatstroke you would have died it not treated at an hospital. Heat exhaustion is when your body is taxed to it maximum but you are still able to sweat (bodys way of regulating heat) and help keep you cool. In a Heatstroke your body shuts down it's cooling mechanism and you must be treated immediately. Your temp rises so fast in a heatsroke that within minutes your body literally cooks itself if not treated. Your skin would be very hot and dry with a heatstroke."

In addition, each reaction was classified as being one of four reaction types. Five small experiments were taken. \nFirst experiment was to observe the reaction when AgNO3 was added to the copper metal. The copper metal was placed in a test tube, and 0.1 M AgNO3 was added. Just after AgNO3 was added, the shiny silver things were observed. Finally, the copper metal was completely changed to shiny silver powder.

"need a workout plan to lose 15 pounds, have a six pack, and increase my vertical jump?
I'm 6'2 and wieigh 200 lbs. I would like to be at 185 lbs but increase muscle mass while losing the fat, have a six pack and increase my vertical jump. I play basketball 5 times a week. Any recommendations on a workout plan geared towards basketball?
Getting fix is 50% exercise, 50% nutrition. If you want a six pack, start watching what you eat, this will really speed up your progress. No junk food, Soda, or fast food. Drink alot of water, keep a water bottle near you all the time. Down around 2.5-4 leaters per day. No fruit juice either, WAYYY too much sugar, much healther to just eat the actual fruits. Try eating more white meat (Chicken, Fish) rather than red meat, pork, beef, lamb. And try having 5 small meals rather than 3 large ones. Eat alot for breakfast to boost your energy level during the day and ease up on dinner because your going to bed after, not burning those calories. As for increasing your Vert, start doing lots of leg exersices to strengthen the muscles in your legs like squats. Do some searching on the web for leg exercies, im sure you'll find alot. Just make sure when doing strength training, be very careful with the weights since your legs are such a big muscle, the weights get pretty heavy. As for your six pack, joggin 4 -5 times a week for 45-60 min should do it for you as well as ab exercises. \n\n-Good Luck!"

I talked to him about it and assured him that I would not say anything, to me it was no big deal. ""Everyone has done it, It's part of growing up."" I said to him but now I just don't know if it was the right thing to say or if it is  biblically correct. I just want some scriptures that says it's wrong or that it's no big deal. Thank You from a GOD fearing man!
Masturbation is an unmentioned topic in the Bible, much like smoking and AIDS. However there are some things to consider that might be helpful in determining the mind of God concerning the matter. \nIn Genesis 1:18 God says that it is not good for a man to be alone, so He made him a helpmeet comparable to him. Paul also says in Romans 1 that man leaving the natural use of the woman for other men isn't good (to put it mildly), and I think that on that same thought process we can say that it is not good for a man to leave the use of woman for the use of himself, so to speak. \nThe real heart of the matter is the matter of the heart. What is driving him to masturbate? If it is lustful intentions in his heart, then he should turn aside from those things and see how much the desire for it is still there. Jesus said that to lust after a woman in your heart is to commit adultery with her in the eyes of God. (Matthew 5:27-30)\nThere are practical things to consider as well, such as the production of semen that the body produces that must be released, but this can also happen naturally while a man is sleeping (wet dreams...). \nIt is a tricky subject to be sure, but not one to be taken lightly or overlooked. God does have a mind about everything, and desires to have a part in the lives of His follwers in every aspect of their lives, including their sexuality. If you can't figure out right or wrong about a given situation, figure out if it is pleasing to the Lord.\nGod bless."
"Why is fire orange and yellow?
Haven't you ever notice how orange and yellow are the two basic colors of fire? Why aren't they green or purple or some other color of the rainbow. Is it certain types of chemicals that make it react that way?
Well I could make it as complex and confusing as some but I will keep it simple.  The color of a flame is determined by the material that is burning. The color also denotes temperature of a flame. (yes there are different degrees of hot). Sodium will give a yellow flame. Have a gas stove? Notice the flame has two colors of blue, the inner flame is a different shade than the outer shade, look at a match, the flame closest to the center of flame is yellowish while the outer is reddish. The center is hotter in both flames.\nAdding a chemical to the fire will change color, copper will burn blue, both from chemical and its flame hotter than the average yellow fire.  The quantity of flame or size is why we cant tell the difference in heat from all these small flames and we say they are hot."

"Why is the middle star of Orion's sword so special???

Actually the leading star in the belt, Mintaka rises due east. Because it is almost exactly on the celestial equator and so easy to identify it is a major navigational star.

"Is it true if you're masterbating , that you're fighting off prostate cancer ? true or false , please answer !
in a recent health news study that i had gotten from a doctor's magazine from his office states if you're between the ages of early 20's , 30's, or your 40's that you decrease your risk of getting prostate cancer . My understanding is that if you shoot for a magic number of 21 : this would give you your chance of sex 4 times a week and five solo sessions at the end of the month , and that would fight off your chance of getting prostate cancer or at least that's what i had gotten out of it !!!
Actually choosing a diet that suits your blood group is recommended for controlling prostate cancer.But I guess masturbating will relax you and take your mind off your problems so it might minimise the risk."

"Is there such a thing as a ""religious spirirt""?
Or is it a man-made term used to attack people who oppose the heretic faith/ wealth/ health/ prosperity preachers like Benny Hinn, (false prophet) Rod Parsley ( false teacher) and TD Jakes\n( false teacher).
Yes, there is a religious spirit, it is a false spirit pretending to know God. \nThis type of spirit will come on someone who is not living the life as they should and live in sin.\n And like Samson, shook himself as before and God was not with him\nThat type of spirit is usually on lay people\n\nI don't believe any of the men of God, above are false prophets\n\nFalse prophets and teacher are those perverting the gospel of Jesus Christ and his teachings. \nThey are those who do oppose the Christian faith,\n and make their own religion, or worship other God's.\n God said have no other God's before me.\nIf you believe not  Jesus Christ and his kingdom, and go and teach others you are not one of us;\nChrist has come in the flesh, born of a virgin, died and rose again, and ascended into heaven.\nIf you don't believe and teach the Kingdom of Heaven, you are a false prophet or false teacher.\nThese men teach, being born again, repentance from dead work, faith in God and the power of his Resurrection\nThey teach the Gospel of the Kingdom"

"what happens to an astronaut when the spacesuit loose all the pressure due to accident?

Astronauts will not ""explode"" if their space suit depressurized. If you've ever seen how things act in a ""vacuum"" bell jar, it explains what would happen: liquids boil at lower temperatures at lower pressures, thus the liquids in the astronaut's body would vaporize and thus the astronaut would be killed (no blood=no oxygen to the brain, for example). Their body would remain intact because skin and other body parts are essentially solids."
"could someone tell me name of the flower? I need its name!?
here is the picture of the flower. http://www.flickr.com/photos/80735812@N00/\n\nit's grown in Southeast Asia. It has stronger smell than jasmine.
That is Murraya paniculata, commonly known as orange jasmine or mock orange in the US and as rain bush in Australia. It is a native of Australia and South East Asia and a serious environmental weed in Hawaii.\n\nThe plant comes in a variety of forms, with the Australian form having smaller, rounder olive green leaves and more leaflets to each leaf. The one in your photo looks like the Malayan form, with large glossy green leaves and relatively few leaflets. There are also cultivated dwarf forms that only grow to a a metre or so in height that make reasonable indoor plants\n\nThey are available at most nurseries and grow  well in most of the southern US. \n\nEdit>>>>\n\nMaverick that is most definitely NOT any type of Gardenia. Gardenias are characterised by TERMINAL infloresences and an INFERIOR gynoecium. You can  see quite plainly from the photographs that this plant has AXILLIARY inflorescences and the gynoecium is SUPERIOR.\n\nMoreover, as you yourself point out, G. jasminoides has SIMPLE leaves. This plant quite clearly has COMPOUND leaves. To the untrained eye this may not be obvious, but look at the first photo provided and look at the flower at the top right. If you look at the leaf that is partially obscuring that flower you can quite clearly see the individual leaflets. \n\nAdded to that G jasminoides has >11 perianth parts. These flowers have 5-10. Have a look at some Gogle images of G. jasminoides. The flowers all have >6 petals and have a superficial similarity to roses. These flowers have only 5 petals.\n\nThis plant quite clearly belongs to the Rutacea. It can not therefore be a Gardenia.\n\nI'm not sure if you are claimiong to be a botanist yourself or that your information comes form a botanist, but I would fail my botany students for identifying that plant as a member of the Rubiacea."

density of helium balloon is less than density of air( with 1 atmosphere pressure) so it goes up(just like wood floating water).\nbut density of air decreases by decreasing pressure(i.e. increase altitude) so in a certain altitude, density of air becomes equal to density of balloon then balloon cease to go higher.\n\nto get more info you can search ""archimedes principle""\n\nI'm afraid you can not explain that to your kid! better to buy him a new balloon !\n\nmy source : studies in university"
"My clothes are getting looser but my weight on the scale doesn't register the loss. Why?
What should I do to drop the weight down as well. Everyone is noticing the difference ..they say I look toned and slimmer. My butt is sooo much smaller than when I started in July 05. All my clothes had to be altered. I do not diet at all. I am 135 lbs, but want to be 125 to 130 lbs.
Okay...first of all, muscle weighs more than fat, so if you are maintaining the same weight, it means that you doing one up from losing weight.  You are gaining muscle.  It is healthier for you.  \n\nBy what you are saying, you don't want to drop the weight down any lower.  I know it is all about that number, but really your body is telling you that it can't go any lower than that number.  You are slimming down, and becoming more fit, and that is what matters the most to your health.  \n\nCongratulations on your success, too!  Keep it up, girl!"

X-ray is an electromagnetic wave.it means that its energy is proportional to its frequency. when an electromagnetic wave collides to a material several phenomena occur.one of them is absorption.the amount of absorption depend on mass absorption coefficient and thickness of material.as density increase , this coefficient will increase and energy of transmitted beam  decrease.  \nX-ray has very high frequency (very high energy) that is harmful for human tissue.consequently lead outfit or barriers is used to absorb high fraction energy of x-ray beam. lead density=11  mean mass absorption=340\ncompare with Aluminum density=2.7   mean mass absorption=77"

The way to build strength fast is by doing short, quick reps but by going all the way down, which is the lastest information they claim to know. You also need to increase either the amount lifted or the number of reps you do once your fitness peaks in order to build all the way up to your amount set for. \nAlso eat more protein of course... you need proper rest between sets cause that's when all the muscle building takes palce... take 2 days off in between the same muscle workout\nthese are good reps you are doing btw. keep it up"

I'm a new personal trainer and I have my first client, but I don't know what I should ask during my consultation before I design a program for them.
Focus on safety and effectiveness. Having given the PAR-Q is an important first step. After that, measure his/her blood pressure, and resting heart rate. \n\nBesides that, there are probably 20 questions you could ask. First of all, ask about their goal. Then, ask about training history, family history, what type of job they have, what activities they enjoy, how much time they have per week to train with you, questions about their lifestyle, nutrition, etc.\n\nAll of these variables, and perhaps others should go into designing a safe and effective program.\n\nGood luck!"

Good luck. There is no blanket site that takes you off of every list.

Read the fine print, and make sure you aren't signing yourself up for unwanted junk mail. \nAs for the companies that already bug you on a steady basis, you will have to find their contact information and request to be removed from their mailing/calling list. Always ask for confirmation that you have been removed."
"Why don't water towers freeze solid in the winter???

They do freeze. They just don't normally freeze solid.\n\nIn the more extreme climates, like North Dakota, engineers incorporate heating systems into the tank design. Specifically, the central pipe that runs from ground level up into the bottom of the tank is called a riser. Water is pumped into the base of the riser and allowed to rise into the tank.  Many tank risers are wrapped with heat tape, covered with insulation and capped by an aluminum jacket.  In addition, a heating system may be installed in an adjacent building or into the valve pit underneath the riser.  The heater introduces heated water or steam into the base of the riser.  In either case, the heat rises into the tank to retard freezing.\n\nIce forms on the surface of the contents, in many cases several feet thick. Normally, this ice layer floats on the surface as the water level rises and falls.  Many times the ice freezes to the roof or upper walls of the tank and remains there as the level fluctuates underneath under daily usage.\n\nIn more temperate climates, steel ladders are installed inside the tank, and riser and water level control probes hang from the roof. In colder climates, all inside fixtures must be left out since the ice layer tends to rip them out."
"What will 7mm magnum do to deer versus a 30-30, both at same distance of 50 yards?

There are two issues at hand.  One is energy.  The other is momentum transfer.  \n\nHere are some muzzle energy for factory loads of the two rounds.\n\n30-30 factory loads:\n150 grain round - 2,390 fps - 1,902 ft. lbs energy\n170 grain round - 2,200 fps - 1,827 ft. lbs energy\n\n7mm factory loads:\n140 grain round - 3,400 fps - 3,593 ft. lbs energy\n160 grain round - 3,200 fps - 3,637 ft. lbs energy\n\nThe 7mm clearly has the uupper hand here.  However, that energy needs to be delivered to the deer to be effective.  Or more correctly, the momentum of the round needs to be transfered to the deer. \n\nThis is where, for example, hollow points are preferable to full metal jackets.  The hollow point will cause the bullet to mushroom giving it better momentum transfer properties (and therefore knockdown power).  FMJ rounds tend to go straight through causing somewhat less damage because of less momentum transfer.\n\nYou want a careful balance here.  Too much energy in too small an animal will make things, let us say, much messier.  All you want is a clean take."
"They say, Aeroplanes can withstand a Lightning which is 1000s of volts, but when a bird hits them, they crash.
HOw can a small bird bring the aircraft down??????? Somebody explain plzz........
It is when a bird gets sucked into the engines. Lightning passes through the plane and in most cases doesn't damage too many things if at all since it just goes through the skin of the aircraft. A bird strike to the jet engines, depending on the size of the bird can disable the engines completely cutting off power and thrust.\n\nYou may think that these metal engines should just cut the bird up without any issue. However, one must realize that the engine operates at such high speeds that any object remotely hard will damage the blades. The blades inside the compressor are under huge amounts of force and heat. Thus, they are very sensitive to strikes.\n\nThese strikes will begin the initiation of very small cracks on the blades which will in turn create larger cracks and thus having the blades break completely. When a piece of a blade flies off, that is where the real damage comes from. It is a chain reaction and the whole engine is gone in a split second.\n\nyou can find more about the topic here\nhttp://www.fodnews.com/"

"How do you feel about diversity in general?
I am inquiring here not just about diversity of peoples (e.g., ethnicity, race, language, sexual preference, etc.) but on a much broader scale encompassing essentially everything. Nature seems to want to proliferate in all directions and every way possible. Do you agree with nature's approach or do you favor one of your own? If the latter, what might that be?
I appreciate diversity because I think that we can all learn from other people who are not like ourselves if it is positive. I do not appreciate people who have a need to force their beliefs on others with a barrage of negative comments and never offering anything positive. Diversity is wonderful if it is positive and done in a way to bring people together, but diversity can also be used as a wedge to drive people apart."

My arms are really huge. In fact, they're not proportionate to my body frame, and i am only 5'1! I have skinny legs, too. I'd try arm exercises, but i know they'll just bulk up. I miss being able to wear tank tops...
You need to do high reps, very low weights on your arms i.e. endurance training. And also cardio will help. If it is muscle try decreasing your intake of protein (chicken, meat, eggs, dairy products etc) but only if you are eating excess amounts. It is important to maintain a balanced diet. If it is fat then simple cardio will work along with reduced calorie intake."

"In scientology, how much does it cost to remove engrams from paying the huge engram counseling fee?
I have been told that engrams are ""bad memories"".  I have also heard that the engram counseling fee's are outrageous, ranging in the tens of thousands of dollars.  Therefore, removal of engrams seem to be rather expensive and, for me, would be the source of many many more engrams from actually paying that much money.
It seems to be one of those scams that the scientologists are pulling like they do during recruitment sessions."
"Ginger is bad for diabetics.Galanga root is a type of ginger.Does galanga root also impair insulin?

Yes.\n\nAmong the natural compounds screened from diverse edible plants in Thailand and other countries in south-eastern Asia for antitumor properties, 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), obtained from rhizomes of the commonly used ethno-medicinal plant Languas galanga (Zingiberaceae), potently inhibits tumor promoter-induced Epstein–Barr virus activation (1). It inhibits xanthine oxidase (2), the enzyme that catalyses the hydroxylation of purine species to yield superoxide ions, and occurs in large amounts in certain brain tumors. . . . . These mechanisms may contribute, at least in part, to its potential use as an anticancer drug. \n\nThe polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are indispensable for proliferation and differentiation of cells. . . . .

Visible orange light has a wavelength of about 590 nm.\n\nWith natural colouring materials such as paints or crayons, orange is a secondary colour that can be derived from primary colours by mixing red (or more accurately, magenta) and yellow.\n\nOrange pigments are largely in the ochre or cadmium families.  Brown is actually on the orange part (orange + grey) of the colour spectrum.\n\nOrange is both a noun and an adjective in the English language. Both refer primarily to the orange fruit and the color orange, but have many other derivative meanings.

"Tell Me about an Osteopath. They seem much more Holistic about Meds and procedures. Thanks?

Osteopathic medicine (also known as osteopathy) is a branch of medicine which views the human body holistically, and emphasizes the prevention and treatment of illness and injury through the use of manual and physical therapies, along with traditional medical practices such as drugs and surgery. Doctors of Osteopathic medicine (D.O.s) educated in the United States are fully licensed physicians equivalent to M.D.s. Osteopaths educated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have a scope of practice limited mainly to musculoskeletal conditions and treatment of some other conditions by manual means.\n\nThe traditional osteopathic approach emphasizes the significance of the neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) system to one's general health and well-being, and the role of NMS dysfunction in the etiology of many diseases. A key goal of osteopathic medicine is the maintenance of healthy body mechanics using a holistic approach that also includes traditional western medicine.\n\nOsteopathic Principles\nThese are the eight major principles of osteopathy and are widely accepted throughout the osteopathic community. They are taken from the curriculum of the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\n(1) The body is a unit.\n\n(2) Structure and function are reciprocally inter-related.\n\n(3) The body possesses self-regulatory mechanisms.\n\n(4) The body has the inherent capacity to defend and repair itself.\n\n(5) When the normal adaptability is disrupted, or when environmental changes overcome the body’s capacity for self maintenance, disease may ensue.\n\n(6) The movement of body fluids is essential to the maintenance of health.\n\n(7) The nerves play a crucial part in controlling the fluids of the body.\n\n(8) There are somatic components to disease that are not only manifestations of disease, but also are factors that contribute to maintenance of the disease state.\n\nThese principles are not held by osteopaths to be empirical laws, nor contradictions to orthodox medical principles; they are thought to be the underpinnings of the osteopathic perspective on health and disease.\n\n[edit]\nTechniques of Osteopathic Manual Medicine (OMM)\nThere are different techniques applied to the musculoskeletal system. These techniques can be applied to:\n\n(1) The joints (using High Velocity Technique, mobilization, etc.)\n\n(2) Their surrounding soft tissues (using functional and soft tissue techniques, etc.)\n\n(3) The muscles\n\n(4) The fascia.\n\nWhen combined, these forms of treatment allow the therapist to restore the normal contact within the joint and with other structures. This eliminates muscular spasms and tensions in the ligaments thereby restoring complete mobility to the joint.\n\nOsteopaths have at their disposal a wide range of manual techniques including:\n\nHigh Velocity (Low Amplitude) Thrust (HVT) (sometimes called an 'adjustment' or joint manipulation) Joint Mobilization Myofascial Release Muscle Energy Trigger or Myodysneuric Point Therapeutic Massage Cranial Osteopathy Visceral Manipulation Lymphatic Pump/Drainage\n\nThese are normally employed together with dietary, postural, and occupational advice, as well as counseling to help patients recover from illness and injury, and to minimize pain and disease. Most osteopaths view manual therapies as a complement to physiotherapy, and the judicious use of invasive therapies (pharmaceuticals and surgery) where necessary.\n\nThe goal of musculoskeletal manipulation is to restore maximal, pain-free movement of the musculoskeletal system in postural balance\n\n[edit]\nScope of Manual Therapies\nThere is now a well-established body of scientific literature that makes a strong case for the use of manual therapies in the treatment of many musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as low back pain, alongside exercise and other rehabilitative techniques. In recent years, the mainstream medical profession has begun to accept the use of manual therapies to treat spinal pain of mechanical orig"
"If you found out one of your children is another man's son,what would you do as a Christian ?
Reason I selected Religion and Spirituality,cause people here are more forgivness but this kid been live with you more than 15 years,you love this kid,what  would you do ?\nThis is a real story from a friend who came to Canada only few months ago.
Kids need to be protected.  No matter how much your friend is hurting, I hope they haven't told the child.  They need to be in a good place where they can support the child and his feelings of shock, grief and betrayal.\n\nI really hope your friend is in counseling.  He needs someone to work through his anger and betrayal with, without it affecting his entire family.\n\nI was 36 when I found out that my mother had led a double life for most of my childhood.  It was still a great shock to me, and it disrupted my life.   The worst of it, though, was that my parents wanted me to take sides and mediate their relationship.\n\nChildren have a tendency to feel guilty for what their parents feel, even when it has nothing to do with them.  Since the boy is biologically someone else's, this could be devastating to him if it's not handled well.\n\nI still think individual counseling as well as family therapy should be pursued.  This is really tough.  I'm hoping the best for them all."

"Why does light slow down in glass/mediums?
I know it's possible to slow light down in a medium to a point where you can see it moving.  However, the speed of light remaind 3x108... what's really going on?
All materials have what is called a ""refractive index"" which is determined by the speed at which light travels through. This is similar to how the speed of sound varies between materials (hard wood vs air). \n\nThe speed of like that you state, 3*10^8 m/s is the speed of light in a vacuum, and only a vacuum.\n\nThe reason the speed of light varies between materials is how light interacts with the atoms in these materials. You see, the way light travels through materials is by getting absorbed by atoms and re-emitted. The energy of an atom rises temporarily. As the energy falls again, the photon is re-emitted out the atom.\n\nThe amount of time it takes for an atom of a substance to do so determines how fast light travels through that substance. This is because the light is just getting absorbed and emitted to be absorbed by the next atom, in a chain!\n\nThis difference in speed accounts for why materials refract light. Without this property, eye glasses, lenses, etc won't work. It is also why things in the water appear distorted etc.\n\nIn a vacuum, however, we cannot change the speed of light, it is a constant."

"Do nerves regenerate?
I had mastectomies, and now, three years later, I still episodically develop stinging pain in one area or another. It lasts a few weeks, then fades. It's been explained as nerve regeneration. But I thought that nerves don't regenerate. I know spinal cord injuries, for example, don't heal themselves. So what DO damaged nerves do? Can they regrow, but in the wrong place? (I wonder this because I have areas of my axilla that, when touched, cause sensation in my back.) Can they ever repair themselves? I'm curious, not concerned.
Difference in terms, with different meanings. Nerve ENDINGS can 'regenerate"", nerve cells cannot. We experience feeling only at nerve endings...that is why an amputee can experience itching in a limb that has been removed....the nerve itself needs stimulation, but the brain only recognizes feeling at the nerve ending...hence, find what is left of the nerve and stimulate it and the 'itching' will stop. The stimulation is done NO WHERE near where the ""itching"" occurs. \nWhen nerve axons or dendrites (nerve cell extensions that carry the signals to and from the nerve cell) are cut, over time, they will often regenerate to provide new nerve endings..this is a slow process and can generate nasty sensations while doing so...itching, burning, etc...and it is often hard to find the spot to stimulate to stop the sensation. Spinal cord injuries are so severe and are so far away from the nerve endings that the regeneration is impossible...to date. Research in Stem Cell propagation has shown very exciting results in mice so far...perhaps there will be a day when we CAN repair spinal cord injuries, at least somewhat. But, if current ridiculous prohibitions to this research are not lifted, the prospects of repairing these injuries will be in the distant future. Here, Religious beliefs are getting in the way of real medical progress. \nYour healing is taking place at a normal rate, may take many years before you feel ""normal"" again...often, as much as 10 years will pass before you are back to somewhat normal feelings. Good luck"

The notion of a Vector space, a mathematical system of a certain kind, has developed into one of the richest concepts in both pure and applied mathematics.\n\nThe concept of vector space pervades mathematics, engineering and the sciences. The questioner is surely familiar with vectors in the form of directed line segment or columns of numbers studied in calculus and mechanics. \n\nThe scope of a general notion of vector is much broader than these examples. For example, functions, matrices and the operation of differentiation will turn out to be vectors.\n\nVector spaces turn up in a wide variety of studies. For example, vector space arise naturally in the study of solutions of systems of equations, geometry in 3-space, solutions of differential equations, finite elements, discrete and continuous Fourier transforms, quantum mechanics, approximation theory and the study of a wide variety of other mathematical and scientific disciplines"

you need to see the doctor.\nMeanwhile, raise your feet as much as you can when sitting, and in bed put a pillow underneath them. Move your feet as often as possible in little circles from the ankles. All these things help the drainage. \nYour feet are swelling due to the blood pressure and your circulation being ineffiecient, it isn't too serious but your doctor may give you a diuretic which will make you pee more, as your blood pressure could be affecting your kidneys.\nIf you are overweight you need to think about diet and exercise as they can help the oedema (fluid),  reduce salt and fat in your food.

Prior to revelation at Sinai, there were no ethical/moral laws.  Each group of people were governed by their own God, pharoah, king, etc. and were at his/her/its mercy.  \nAfter revelation at Sinai, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years as they learned to live in ""freedom"" with God and His laws as a guide.  Since the Israelites had never lived in freedom, they were doomed to wander in the wilderness until their children became of age and were able to function as a free people under God, their king, in the promised land.\nIn the promised land, everyone was held accountable to God's law -- especially the leaders.  It was a duty and privilege for everyone to study Torah, learn the law, and to assure that everyone received equal treatment under God's law.  Because everyone studied the law, the Levites could not invent and change laws willy-nilly.  They were accountable to God just the same as the lowly sheperd.\nOver time, God's laws have been adopted by other nations and justice for all has prevailed in some countries.\nWithout the laws of the Torah, insane leaders could commit monstrous acts of violence and atrocities without consequences.  Men could kill women and children simply from a fit of anger.  Everyone would live in constant terror not knowing from where the next threat would come.\nIn essence, we owe our freedom from terror to the words of wisdom found in this wonderful book we call our Bible!  \nIn today's world of terrorism, it makes one wonder how those words have become so distorted."
"How do you get bigger boobs?
How do you get boobs without surgery or pills? im eleven. Anyone got any answers??? i need to know! please help! im urgent! my friends will ditch me if i dont! and they're my only friends! plz help!
You can't do anything except wait to get bigger boobs. If your friends will ditch you, then they're not really friends. When you get a boyfriend who likes you even if you have no boobs, then your ""friends"" will become jealous."
"how does culture affect the way you communicate with others?

I think it affects alot because culture is also how a person is brought up like in most arab countries girls are brought up differently they are not allowed to talk to boys and when they actually meet a guy they might be shy or scared or something. Whether its due to the islamic influence or something else i dont know.\nI know alot of girls who are that way they are not bold enough to go to a guy and talk to him. It all depends on how you are brought up and what your parents believe (culture) and whether or not they let you be your own person.\nI hope this answers your question."

After a long eventful night with tha wife, i got up tha next morning 2 relieve myself and noticed something scuttling across muh balls...I immediately sprayed it with lysol and i just wondered what crabs look like so id kno if thats what it was or not?

I am a quiet person, if everyone was like me no-one would speak. If we were all the same life would be dull.\n\nTo help though, first don't stress yourself, think about what you are saying and how you say it. Then listen, really listen to other people. If you care what people think of you, take care of there feelings and your own.\n\nRemember the world needs talkers and listeners. Good luck."
"Is there a conflict between Catholics and Protestants?
I don't hear about it where I live.\n\n\nIf there is, wheere did it start?
For mainstream Catholics and Protestants, there are minor disagreements on minor points of doctrine.

"Do you think that technology has helped us or hurt us?  Why?
I think that it has done both.  It has helped us by discovering new medicines and capturing violent criminals, among many others things.  But, I think that it has hurt our morals.
There is no two words about it:\nThe technology has helped us, but the only thing is everything has pros and cons. Without technology/scientific knowlege we wouldn't be answering these questions on internet. Technology/scientific knowledge made us realize that stars are not haning lanterns (as mentioned in some folk stories). Technology/scientific knowledge made us realize that the world is not flat and it is not a huge flat surface shouldered by 4 large elephants on a huge turtle that floats on the sea (this is a true mythical idea long time back). \nBut there are bad sides to it too. Golbal warming / wars / pollution and there are many too. It depends on the way people use it. \nBut the next generations will be more brainier than us. They shall tackle these issues too. It is our duty make the next generation brainier, to put them in the right track. \nDon't worry about technology, it is always for good."

"I need to know what the Principal of Dominance and Recessiveness is. It's for biology, and i really need help!

Very simply put, dominance and recessiveness are characteristics of genes.\n\nA dominant gene is expressed (shows up visibly in the offspring) when only one copy of the gene is present, on one chromosome from one parent. Let's say Tallness is a Dominant gene. If you have ONE tall parent, and get ONE copy of the Tall gene, you will probably be tall. If your tall parent was the son or daughter of a TALL and a SHORT person, they may only have ONE copy of that gene. If you get both SHORT chromosomes from Mom and DAD, you will NOT be tall. So you have 50 to 100 chance of being tall with a Dominant gene.\n\nNow, let's take the gene for BLUE eyes. It is recessive. You need TWO copies of this gene to get blue eyes. If Mom has blue eyes and Dad has blue eyes, and you get copies of both blue eye genes, you will have blue eyes. But if Mom has blue eyes, and Dad has brown eyes, you might end up with Brown eyes. Don't that make your blue eyes brown, so to speak.\n\nBUT..if Dad's mom had blue eyes and Dad's dad brown (your grandparents) and if Dad has one blue eye gene and one brown eye gene and has brown eyes AND if your Mom still has those blue peepers, you have a 1/4 chance of ending up with one blue eyed gene from AND a blue eyed gene from Dad and you will also have blue eyes like your Mum. Don't that make your brown eyes...blue?"

"I hope has heard about the ashoka Pillar thugh it has been constructed 1000's of years ago.........?
Why there is no rusting .
It is likely due to the high phosphorus content of the iron. Another factor may be that in the ancient wrought iron a certain amount of slag particles which enhance the passivity.  Climate factors may be important too.  It probably does have a coat of rust though.

"is protien in urine a serious problem? although there wasnt any sugar in urine?

Proteinuria\n\nHealthy kidneys take wastes out of the blood but leave in protein. Impaired kidneys may fail to separate the protein from the wastes. Proteinuria means protein in the urine, and it is a sign of poor kidney function. If your urine makes foam in the toilet, it may contain high levels of protein. Your doctor may test for protein using a dipstick in a small sample of your urine taken in the doctor's office. The color of the dipstick indicates the presence or absence of proteinuria. For a more precise measurement, you may need to collect urine for 24 hours."
"What, in Islam, happens to women when they die?
I mean, we've all heard about the virgins for men and all that but what is supposed to happen to the women? Seriously, I'm really curious.
Actually, there's nothing in the Quran that speaks of any number of virgins in heaven, that is just a stereotypical rumor that some have decided to spread against Islam.\n\nIt DOES however, mention a great ammount of ""houris"" which is a non-gendered creature of light and beauty (no mention of any sexual nature), and is meant for both the men AND the women. No one is certain what their purpose is, we can only speculate.\n\nTo further answer your question, the descriptions of heaven aren't meant only for a man or woman, but both genders enjoy all of it's bounties. What few descriptions are given aren't necessarily and exact of heaven itself, but merely the best representation that can be given to us at this time. God tells us that even our greatest imaginations of the beauty and bounties of heaven cannot compare to the real thing, as it is beyond our understanding. So when the Quran describes heaven as ""gardens beneath which rivers flow"" it is simply giving us a small explanation in the best way that we can understand. The holy lands rest in the mostly barren deserts, so to describe that the heavens will consist of gardens and springs (""beneath which rivers flow"") is showing the desert folk just how rewarding it can be, so that they will work for it, making the best of this life in preparation for the next.\nI hope this helped you."

"why is t-butanol more soluble/miscible in H2O than n-butanol?

tertiary butanol is more spherical and n-butanol is more linear. since the molecule is only polar at the hydroxyl group this is where the polar bonds are formed with water. the rest of the hydocarbon chain resists bonding and serve to decrease solubility.\n\nsince t-butanol is spherical, it has a more compact structure for its hydrocarbon portion. n-butanol on the other hand has a long, exposed alkyl chain ."

"Colon Cleanse  a.k.a. Colon Hydro Therapy?
Has any one ever had a colon cleanse before, and if so did it help to releave bloating and annoying daily stomach pains?  I feel that all the fiber products that's supposed help with regular bowel habits does not help me at all. I'm also tired of eating grapenuts every other day.  I just need some one to tell me about how their expericence was when they got the colon cleanse.
Eating grapenuts everyother day doesn't sound appealing, unless you really like it.  Your bloating and stomach pains are the real problem you need to work on.  The plugged up colon is the by product of what is happening in your stomach.  First get your stomach working well again.  A digestive aid for your stomach is Hydrocloric acid (pills or capsule).  Next get some enzymes for the intestines.  Then get some acidophilus for digestion.  Are you over eating or eating the same foods everyday?  Get more variety in your diet.  Are you brushing your tongue when you brush your teeth?  A clean tongue will taste the food better.  Your sense of taste is vital for good digestion.  Without it you won't make the digestive juices that are needed for assimulating food.\nLast is the colon cleanse.  If the colon is plugged up, nothing leaves the house.  Its like sweeping the floor with the door closed.  You can't get the dirt out."

A Ponzi scheme is essentially an investment fraud wherein the operator promises high financial returns or dividends that are not available through traditional investments. Instead of investing victims' funds, the operator pays ""dividends"" to initial investors using the principle amounts ""invested"" by subsequent investors. The scheme generally falls apart when the operator flees with all of the proceeds, or when a sufficient number of new investors cannot be found to allow the continued payment of ""dividends.""\n\nFor information on common fraud schemes, including ponzi and pyramid schemes among many others, and what to do if you have been defrauded, visit the FBI's fraud page at:\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/frauds..."

Spring 2006, what a wonderful hopeful screen name.  Glad your not here in a desert where its 90 degrees.  How about that spring for you.\n\nI am a third generation name sake and I will be expecting the fourth generation here in the next few days.  You do not have to congratulate me, only give me best answer, that is gift enough!\n\nNames have nothing to do with such relationships.  Relationships are built between 2 people, usually naming comes from the parent.  So there is no bonding done by the baby, not yet that is.\n\nChildren cognitively cannot comprehend the likeness, youth usually resent such things, it is not until your an adult that you appreciate the heritage that was passed.\n\nYour word intense, not so.\n\nOn the ligher side of intense relationships, the first night I met my wife (at that time future Mrs)I told her that if were to ever get married and have our first son, there would be a no compromise of his name, not even a talk.  And to this very day our relationship has been fine.  Im jus glad we did not have a girl\n\nHappy heritage hunting!  All hail my future IV!!"
"did the disciples literally eat jesus?
I have heard that the reason only some people witnessed the ressurection was because those were the people that had eaten some of Jesus' body. Only the ones who had eaten some of his flesh could see him afterwards.The person who told me this, who is my therapist, also said that  the reason ""the holy mass"" is called that is because after they took the body down from the cross a big mass of people rushed up and ate it.
Prominent in the Gospels is the mention of Jesus' intact body being respectfully treated and interred by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. Jesus' body was not literally consumed by animals or humans.\n\n(John 19:38-40) Joseph from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one out of his fear of the Jews, requested Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body away. 39 Nicodemus also... 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it up with bandages with the spices\n\n\nConsumption of blood has been forbidden since Noah's time, and both cannibalism and abuse of blood were forbidden by the Jewish Mosaic Law. Since the Mosaic Law was not abolished until after Jesus' death; the ceremony mentioning ""flesh"" and ""blood"" which Jesus instituted would not have been understood with any hint of literalness by the apostles (See Matt 26; Mark 14; Luke 22).\n\nAt the ""Last Supper"", Jesus was preparing his disciples for his departure from earth. He was teaching them to use the bread and wine as symbols of Christ's sacrificial offering of his own flesh and blood; these symbols would be featured at future observances of that ""Memorial"" celebration.\n\nThe most significant ""Memorial"" one could observe is, of course, the Memorial of Christ's death; even today that annual commemoration is still called ""the Last Supper"" or ""the Lord's Evening Meal"".\n\n(1 Corinthians 11:23-25, NWT) The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf... Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” 25 He did likewise respecting the cup.. Keep doing this... in remembrance of me.” \n\n(1 Cor 11:24, 25, NEB) ""Do this as a memorial of me.” \n\n\nChrist Jesus himself personally celebrated and explained the significance of that Last Supper to his followers (see Matthew 26:26-29). Apparently Jesus Christ established the occasion to supersede the Jewish Passover, which occurs after sunset on the 14th of Nisan (a month of the Jewish calendar).\n\n(Luke 22:14-16) At length when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him. 15 And [Jesus] said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; 16 for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it becomes fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\n\n\nSadly, it is only a minority of professed Christians who follow the BIBLICAL pattern for the Last Supper which was established by Christ himself. Sadly, most of Christendom ignores Christ's celebration and instead follow unrelated human traditions which purport to honor Christ, but in ways unconnected with what Jesus Christ established.\n\nLike the former Passover, those Christians who commemorate the Last Supper have also done so on the date corresponding to Nisan 14, which generally falls between late March and mid-April. Interestingly, Christians in the centuries immediately after Christ's impalement were sometimes called ""Quartodecimans"" which literally mean ""fourteen-ers""\n\n\nThere are fundamental differences between the Memorial which Christ Jesus instituted and the so-called ""Easter"" which Christendom adopted from pagan worship of the Anglo-Saxon goddess Eostre (or Oestre). While most Easter celebrations merely repackage pagan fertility festivals and concentrate on eating, decorating, and frivolity, the Last Supper focuses on the value of Christ's sacrifice and the sober obligation of Christianity. \n\n(Matthew 15:6-9) You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said, 8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. 9 It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/lmn/article_0"
"what are some snacks that i can have when i'm loosing weight?
i'm trying 2 loose some weight but sometimes i get hungry what snacks can i have?????
fruits like grapes and berries - they are lower in sugar carbs.  Also carrots have more carbs than cellery, but are good for you.  I like to get some low calorie ranch to dip my veggies in.  I prefer fresh broccoli, carrots, cellery, and mushrooms.  Also if you like black olives, you can have a few of those each day too."

"What would happen if you add water to the alkali metals and alkali earth metals?

Alkaline metals like lithium, sodium and potassium etc in  pure form would float in water is added to them. But that would be only part of the reaction because simultaneously  they are reacting with the water, producing hydrogen bubbles which buoy them up. Potassium producing enough that it bursts into flame normally and sodium sometimes depending on the size of chunk. The remaining alkali metals all have explosive reactions with water."
"According to the definition of a derivative : lim (f(x+h)-f(x))/h, what is the derivative of this function?
The equation is f(x)=5x/(5x+2) and the solution will involve the variables ""h"" and ""x"".
well if your taking the derivative, then there should be no h's left over at the end, since they go to zero with the limit.  The derivative of that function is [5(5x+2)+25x]/(5x+2)^2.  I'll leave it to you to simplify."
"what is a cysto procedure?

Endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra is called cystoscopy. Diagnostic cystoscopy is usually carried out with local anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is sometimes used for operative cystoscopic procedures.\n\nWhen a patient has a urinary problem, the doctor may use a cystoscope to see the inside of the bladder and urethra.\n\nThe urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The cystoscope has lenses like a telescope or microscope. These lenses let the doctor focus on the inner surfaces of the urinary tract. Some cystoscopes use optical fibres (flexible glass fibres) that carry an image from the tip of the instrument to a viewing piece at the other end. The cystoscope is as thin as a pencil and has a light at the tip. Many cystoscopes have extra tubes to guide other instruments for procedures to treat urinary problems.\n\nThere are two main types of cystoscopy - flexible and rigid - differing in the flexibility of the cystoscope. Flexible cystoscopy is carried out using local anaethesia on both sexes. Typically, lidocaine gel (such as the brand name Instillagel) is used as an anaesthetic, instilled in the urethra. Rigid cystoscopy can be performed under the same conditions, but is generally carried out under general anaesthesia, particularly in male subjects, due to the discomfort caused by the probe.\n\nA doctor may recommend cystoscopy for any of the following conditions:\n\nFrequent urinary tract infections \nBlood in the urine (hematuria) \nLoss of bladder control (incontinence) or overactive bladder \nUnusual cells found in urine sample \nNeed for a bladder catheter \nPainful urination, chronic pelvic pain, or interstitial cystitis"
"Is there ANY WAY to find forclosure/property auctions without paying fees for the info?
Obviously I'm not hot in the real estate business, but if I want to check out an auction and see what it looks like, what a forclosed property might look like and what the bidding might look like, I don't want to pay an ""information broker"" for a list that could prove useless.  Any body have any suggestions?
Most investors don't have a problem spending, at most, $30 to $50 a month (until cancelled) to get a list of properties where every single one of those properties can be purchased for tens of thousands of dollars less than other houses on the market. By the way, what do you consider 'useless'? If you are unable to purchase the property that you want, it's not the fault of the person who sold you the list. But, if they flat out scam you by providing you with a bogus list, you can always take it up with your credit card company or law enforcement. I suggest that if that amount of money is a problem for you, avoid auctions. Good luck!\n\nSomeone mentioned sites that list foreclosed properties. We are one of them, although we typically charge for those lists because we verify everything ourselves."
"what does it mean to be 'hung drawn and quartered'?

It was an old English method of execution for things like treason. The offender was hanged, but cut loose before he died. Then his abdominal organs and gentials were removed (drawn) and burned in front of him. Next his heart was cut out, at which point he'd finally die. Lastly, he was beheaded and his body was cut into four segments (quartered). I think the arms and legs were simply cut off as the four pieces, and mutilated torso disposed of. So that's the general idea."

"I have a credit card terminal... now what?
I have built several e-commerce websites for clients but I am trying one myself.  I have the web site created and when orders are placed, I receive a PGP encrypted email with the necessary information to process the card.  I ordered an Omni 3200 credit card terminal off Ebay and it seems to work okay but I need some help.  I plan on getting a merchant account at my local bank so will they help set me up to use my terminal?  I have been playing with my terminal and it says something about downloading an application but I have no idea what it's talking about.  This is my first time.  Please help!
The good news is that the Omni 3200 is Class-A certified by TSYS (the old VisaNet) so you should be able to use it with pretty much any processor. Many of the terminals on Ebay are old proprietary machines that can only be used with certain processors. The 3200 is a good terminal that will be able to process cards with qualifying info to achieve the lowest rates. The download will be performed by the processor who you decide on when you set up your merchant account. \n\nTechnically, you will be considered a mail order merchant instead of a e-commerce merchant since you do not process directly over the internet. As you probably know, this makes a big difference in regards to the setup costs. It does, however, also add a manual step in processing that will need to be properly managed.\n\nYour bank may seem like a very easy choice for processing. Unless it is a very large bank, though, they do not actually perform merchant processing services. It is more likely that they have been solicited by a merchant processor that won the bid for your banks customer leads and a certain portion of your fees will now go to your bank. The service and support, though, will be handled by the processor and your bank will not be involved.\n\nBe sure to consider the following:\n1.) As you are processing mail order exclusively, be very aware of the retail ""card not present"" rates that your processor assesses. \n\n2.) Be sure to know all of the different card rates. You will most likely receive debit cards, personal MC and Visa, Visa Rewards, MC World, and MC & Visa Corporate cards. Many processors sneak in a ""nonqualified"" rate for the Rewards, World and Corporate cards that can be upwards of 3%.\n\n3.) Make sure that your processor and the service provider that shares your customer's card info are on the same page to assure your qualification levels. Anytime that you do not enter the required ""Level 2"" info for a mail order, you will be downgraded to a higher cost transaction.\n\n4.) Lastly, ask the service provider that sends you your orders for their PCI Data Security compliance information. This should protect you against any penalties should there be a breach of cardholder information. For more about PCI, see the Visa webpage at: http://usa.visa.com/business/accepting_visa/ops_risk_management/cisp.html\n\nIf you would like more information about merchant processing, feel free to contact me at jbordeaux@windriverfinancial.com or at (920)993-9433. Wind River is a merchant processor that specializes in offering well supported, competitively priced, custom processing services."

To set up a case against McDonald's on this, one would have to justify what McDonald's does with the gigantic shipments of meat it regularly orders from cattle farmers. If one was to suppose that kangaroo meat was used, one would have to question why there aren't obvious bulk quantities of kangaroo meat coming into the US from Australia.\n\n\nBeef tallow in french fries"
"can an evolutionist answer this question?
first let me say that i believe in evolution.  i am not an ignorant creationist.  but this one thing has confounded me.  why do you think that people from arabic nations are so hairy in general.  they come from a warm climate.  i would think hair would have been phased out over time.
First off, I have lived in Arab countries for over twenty years, and was married to an Arab woman; while living there, I read many French scientific studies that dealt with Semitic hairiness; the majority view is that hirsuteness shields the skin from UV and heat; hair also traps an insulating air layer close to the skin; which does not heat up more than body temp.. especially when loosely covered by long tubular garments, such as all desert dwellers wear; which aids by trapping yet another layer of insulating air.\n\nBut one must remember that nighttime temps in all deserts approach freezing; this hirsuteness serves equally well at that time.  And, yes, Arabs and other Semitic groups tend to hirsuteness; as do individual groups from other ethnic groups worldwide...  some of whom may need the extra hair, others who do not; because of environment or technology or lack thereof."

The trumpets will partially destroy the following, vegetation, the sea, water, solar light, release demons, release four angels for destruction, great announcement of the kingdom.

"Am I horrible because I feel my mom's death liberated me?
My mom and I had a horrible relationship. She treated me like a bad step-child, not her one and only daughter. She was always sick and I would break my back to help her and she still treated me like crap. I went through so much pain, abuse (emotional and sexual), and more and never told her. Once I wrote her a letter and told her I wanted to commit suicide because of how she made me feel, and she laughed and said I would be dumb if I did. That was just one of her bad moments. When she died 2 years ago, I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders!\nAnyone gone through something like this?
Not actually liberated but let me tell you a little about my situation. My mom died Dec 2004 of cancer and it was devasting. However, my mom had always mentally abused me by letting me know I was not wanted, if abortion were legal she would not have had me, how I reminded her of my father who she despised,etc. So my whole life I tried to please her so she would accept me. Well I had been in counseling for years and basically was told I was in a abusive relationship with my mother! My psychiatrist told me I had to stand up to her because her deragatory statements I would never allow from another person. Well, long story short, she had become very sweet during chemo and never said any negativity. Well, she went into remission and the real meanie was back in force. I finally got the courage to tell her that until she could treat me with respect (I was 31) I would not be around. She had started talking bad about me to my son!! Well, she died 8 months later. Although I did speak with her the last 3 months of her life we never spoke about anything but her getting better. How guilty I felt when she died!! However my doctor told me that what I had did was NOT WRONG it was just unfortunate that she died before we ever resolved my past issues with her. I definately feel much more in control and powerful since her passing because I would never allow anyone to treat me or my son the way she did. Take care and learn from your upbringing. Don't treat your children the way you were treated and stay strong."

"What do you think of the idea of linking autism to vaccinations?
Any personal experiance information is welcomed, Thanks
Could be?\n\nMy son is severly autistic.  At about 12 months old he was developing perfectly (he has a sister who is 15 months older so we had a good recent example of developing infant).  Then an unexplained event occurred.  We do not believe it was a seizure but somewhere between the 12-15 months he recessed quickly but not immediately.  This is the time he received is first 12 month vaccinations.\n\nAt one point we thought he was deaf because he would no longer respond to our verbal requests and he (besides crying and laughing) went almost mute.\n\nThe only other recent bit of study that matched my son was the relevance to the size of the child's head.  My son was born with a larger than normal head not abnormal but definately large.  We had baby clothes given to us up until he was 2 years old that would not fit because it wouldn't go over his head.  The idea on this study is that the brain grows to fast and the wiring of the networks for the brain to run on are not developed correctly during those early critical months/years.\n\nLong answer - could be I don't think we'll know in my life time."

"what is the largest bee/wasp?
my son said he saw one on display in a museum that was over 2ft. in length?any info would be helpful.
As far as I know the largest bee or wasp in the world is the Japanese giant wasp (Vespa mandarinia).  They are big, fierce, nasty-tempered beasts, but they 'only' reach 2 inches in length, not feet.\n\nHere is little National Geographic article about them. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1025_021025_GiantHornets.html\n\nThe largest flying insect ever known, Meganeura was a dragonfly that lived about 280 million years ago.  It had a wingspan of close to 2 feet, but it's body was not that long, nor as robust as a bee's or wasp's body would be.\n\nIf there was a 2 foot long bee in a museum it is likely that it was a model mock-up, blown up in size for dramatic purposes and/or to show details that would be hard to see on a life-size display."
"What is the cause of UTI?

UTI or urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria that have gotten into the urinary tract (that includes from the urethra [the opeing where urine comes out of] up to the kidneys). The usual bacterias that are usually involved are Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, and a lot of other bacteria. The urinary tract is normally sterile, so whatever bacteria gets in can cause UTI. by the way, fungi can also cause UTI, the most common being Candida sp.\n\nRisk of getting UTI is increased if the genitalia are not washed regularly, habitually holding the peeing for a long period of time, in females, wiping the genitalia from behind to the front, not changing underwear regularly."
"What are the alternatives to flossing?
I hate flossing!!!!\n\nAre there other ways to clean the teeth but have the same results as flossing?   Besides brushing and mouthwash.
There are several alternatives to flossing for those who find it too difficult, too painful (sensitive gums or gum disease) or ineffective (those people with braces or delicate bridge work. But remember one thing: Never use a toothpick as a substitute for flossing. Toothpicks can tear delicate gum tissue and may damage existing dental restorations. \n\nOne popular flossing alternative is called a water pick, or irrigator. \n\nWater picks use powerful tiny bursts of water to blast away food particles and other debris in hard-to-reach areas of your mouth. Dentists use professional-grade water picks when preparing a tooth for restoration, or in general cleaning and exams. \n\nPeople with painful gum disease or highly sensitive gums may find water picks useful for supplementing their brushing regimen. And people with orthodontia, including braces, have found water picks quite useful because toothbrush bristles often get stuck. Antibacterial rinses (over-the-counter and by prescription) are somewhat effective. There are also several types of brushes designed specifically to clean in between the teeth."
"Transitioning:  liberal arts undergrad to science grad?
I hope this question is not inappropriate for the category, but I was wondering what the process would be for someone who has a liberal arts (more specifically, B.A. in History) from an Ivy League who wanted to go to grad school and focus on earth/atmospheric science.  I have had a few basic courses (oceanography, earth science and geology) as an undergrad, but no calculus, physics or chemistry.  How difficult do you think it would be to transition to a new field?  What would the requirements be?  What first steps should I take?  Any help is most appreciated!
As an undergrad I was an English major for three years before switching to Chemistry.  I had to start all over (unfortunately, none of my Shakespeare transferred).  It wasn't easy, but it wasn't any harder than analyzing poetry to the professor's satisfaction.  But honestly, any person with brains can get any degree they want.  You are, however, going to have to prove your worth as an analytical thinker to the college that will accept you into their science program.  Try to get the calculus, physics, and intermediate geography/meteorology done before applying- possibly at a community college.  You could always go talk to faculty at the college you want to apply to and see which classes would transfer from where, which classes you would need, or if you can just directly apply to their program.  Hopefully you will do well in those classes you need, and along with your probably stellar standardized test scores should open the doors to any program you want to enter."

Translations of the Quran into any other language is not recognised by Islam so, unless you understand arabic, the answer to your first question is, No.\n\nIn answer to your second question, Yes, translated versions (in book form) are both free and freely available on the internet.

"How come there are chloroplasts in plants, aside from the mitochondria?
Since both mitochondria and chloroplasts are involved in energy transformation, how come plant cells have both mitochondria and chloroplasts while animal cells only have mitochondria?
Both of these organelles do similar processes, just in different directions. Mitochondria are respiratory structures the consume chemical energy. Chloroplasts create high energy molecules for respiration. they work together. It is without question that the chemical energy you consume today was created by photosynthetic organism using chloroplasts. That means the food you eat is a product of photosynthesis and light from the sun. We create CO2 for the process of photosynthesis. We are higher in the food chain so we don't need chloroplasts to make energy. We just eat other organisms."

"Do some churches use real wine instead of grape juice?
I have heard this is true.  Why the difference?
Christians and Alcohol\n\nby David J. Stewart\n\nThere is NO ""safe"" amount of alcohol\n\n""Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?  They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.  Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.  Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.  They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."" -Proverbs 23:29-35\n\nAlcohol is a Mind-Altering Drug\n\nThere is absolutely NO way for a believer to justify drinking alcoholic beverages.  The Scriptures found in Proverbs 23:29-35 clearly warn everyone (Christian or non-Christian) to abstain from the DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE OF ALCOHOL.   ""Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.""  Did you read that?...LOOK NOT!  God is telling us NOT to drink intoxicating wine, not even to ""look"" at it (i.e., consider drinking it)!  For the wise Christian, drinking alcohol is NOT even an option.\n\nThe Bible is such a practical book.  I recently ran across an atheist's website.  The man tried to discredit God and the Bible by pointing out all the ugly portions of the Bible.  But the real world is ugly and God is very honest with us in the Bible.  It doesn't surprise me that spoiled rotten Americans would have a problem with the Bible.  The Bible puts the cookies on the bottom shelf...the truth is there if you want it.  Most people don't want to hear the truth (but ironically say they do).  \n\nIf you'll take another look at the above passage of Scriptures, you'll find the truth about alcohol...it ""biteth like a serpent"" and ""stingeth like an adder"".  ""Strange women"" is simply a reference to women who are not his wife.  It's just a fact, alcohol and immorality go together!  The reference to a man lying down in the ""midst of the sea"" is simply his hallucinations from the effects of the alcohol.  Likewise, the hallucination of lying down at the top of the ship's mast.  Alcohol is a DRUG!  This is a well-established FACT.  As such, alcohol should be treated as a drug but is not.  Alcohol abuse has killed millions, whereas Marijuana has not.  So why is alcohol legal when Marijuana is not?   Multitudes of people have spent years in prison for smoking and/or selling Marijuana.  Unbelievably, there are people who have been sentenced to life in prison for mere drug possession, while drunk drivers who committed murder walked away Scot-free.   Alcohol is far more dangerous and intoxicating than Marijuana.  This is a great HYPOCRISY in America.  The Bible clearly teaches that the effects of alcohol have sinful tendencies.  \n\n \n\nAlcohol's Bloodthirsty History\n\nLook again at the Scriptures above...""They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.""  Clearly, this is a reference to drunkenness.  Only God knows how many beer-drinking people have woke up the next morning, suffering from a hangover, not remembering what sins they committed the night before.  Hundreds-of-thousands of alcoholics  have frozen to death on city streets, feeling no coldness due to the numbing effect of the alcohol.  Many others have been jack-rolled (beaten up) and didn't remember anything when they woke up in the hospital.   It is wickedness!  Millions-upon-millions of Americans br"
"Is amway a reliable company to work with?

Amway went through their hyper-growth period years ago.  Those who were involved then did very well.  I, for one, run the other direction when approached by Amway because they are so secretive about what they do.  They have a bad reputation because of their cult-like approach.\nWhen looking for a home business you should start by checking to see if they are in good standing with the Better Business Bureau, after that comes the product.  Is it something people are looking for or something you are trying to convince the customer they are looking for?  You have to believe in your product in order to sell it.  Then you need to really look at the compensation plan...at what stage do you start earning an income?  Another huge consideration is the Baby Boomers....what are they looking for now?  In the late 40's to 50's, Gerber Baby Food saw an opportunity and made a fortune, in the 60's it was Fisher Price and Mattel, the 70's saw a surge in real estate, etc.  Any time you have a product that the boomers are looking for, you have an 18 year window of opportunity.  Therefore, you need to seek a company that has not experienced hyper-growth yet but is about to.  What the boomers are spending billions of dollars on now is their health and anti-aging products or formulas.  Anytime you can stay ahead of the boomers with a product, you will succeed."

Making lifestyle changes and having appropriate pain medicine and a knowledgable Neurologist/Neurosurgeon goes a long way."
"What is the best fruit juicer product out there?

Be careful with juice.  I have been doing some research and fruit juice is too concentrated with simple sugars which can cause you to gain weight.  Vegetable juices are better.  The best juicers are strong enough to pulverize the pulp into juice so you drink that also.  The extra pulp will be a great source of fiber and offset the sugar concentration.  The strongest juicers are also the most expensive but worth it in the long run!  Good Luck!"

"how do you know if you are gay?
i think that i am falling in love with one of my femail friends. she likes me and is Bi but i think that i am straight. how do you really know?
It really depends on how you define being gay.\n\nFor some, being gay is simply something that happens once an act is fulfilled.  Personality, gender identification and intent are irrelevant.  So long as you had a homosexual experience, you are gay. End of story.\n\nFor others, the act is less important than the intent.  A guy, for example, might find himself having homosexual sex due to being in prison with other guys for so long.  But this does not necessarily make him gay.  Another guy, on the other hand, may find himself attracted to and willing to spend his life with another man in a sexual and passionate relationship.  He identifies himself as gay.\n\nFor others even, its more inherent in one's actions and personality than intent.  Being wishy-washy, talking with a particular accent to it, wearing certain clothes, all these are marks of being gay for some people.\n\nSo, I say decide first on what ""Being Gay"" means for you, then see if you apply to that definition.  That is, of course, assuming you prefer sticking yourself into a label.\n\nAfter all, why can't we all just be called sexual human beings?"

A Christian sect, that came from England just before the revolution. I read a brief descript. of them, but I'd like to know more.
I have heard of them and come from a similar group -- Quakers.\n\nThe Shakers are an offshoot of the Religious Society of Friends (or Quakers) that originated in Manchester, England in the early 18th century.

"Physics Homework about force...someone help?
A 4.3 g bullet leaves the muzzle of a rifle with a speed of 304 m/s. What force (assumed constant) is exerted on the bullet while it is traveling down the 0.86 m long barrel of the rifle?
we know m=0.0043kg, Vfinal=304m/s, d=0.86m and Vinitial=0\n\nwhat we need is the value of acceleration ( remember F=ma )\n\nso the formula we need is\n\nvfina^2=viinitial^2 + 2ad\n304^2=0 + 2*0.86*a\na=(304^2)/(2*0.86)\na=53730.23256\n\nso F=m*a=53730.23256*.0043=231.04 N\n\nForce is 231.04 N\n\n*****************************************************\n\nHere's an alterative if you want to double check  \n\nthe kinetic energy (KE)=1/2 *m*(velocity)^2\n\nthe KE of the bullet must equal the Work needed to fire it\n\nKE=0.5*0.0043*304^2 =198.6944 j\n\nWork=F*d=198.6944\n\nso F=(198.6944)/0.86=231.04 N\n\nAgain we get  force = 231.04 N\n\nSo we're pretty sure this is the correct answer"

They will ask you questions, even on yahoo answers - there will be open doors.\nJust pray, read, wait, pray, and answer with Love, not judging and serve/help others.\n\nJesus said  He came not to bring a sword, but He came to serve.  We are His servants to the world.\n\nWe are doers of the Word, and this doing is possible to accomplish(Phil.4:13).\n\nWe live this type of lifestyle out of love for Jesus.

Try eating fruits.  If that doesn't work, then often the case may be that your body is really craving protein.  Eat a little more low fat protein with your meals, and this may help curb the cravings.  Another thing is to not totally cut out sweets.  Just eat them in moderation.

"What has helped you the most with regard to erectile dysfunction?
Are there any OTC preps that really help?
Viagra! I'm 65 and a few years ago found I was having a bit of a problem maintaining erections during intercourse. No problems with masturbation or receiving oral sex because you don't need a full erection of either. Viagra did the trick and I have no problems getting or maintaining erections now. My girlfriend and I are both happy! Nothing to be ashamed about...a very common situation for guys as they get older. A couple of other drugs, Cialis and Levitra work pretty much the same way. If you have the problem, discuss it with your doctor. Don't get ripped off by web purchases...it's more expensive and may even be phony pills. There are a few people that shouldn't take these drugs...it can kill you if you are using nitrite drugs for your heart for example! For the majority of guys it's okay and the doctor will give you a sample pack and a prescription. Side effects are usually minor and temporary...a flushed face, blurred vision, headaches for some (none seem to apply to me). Biggest negative is the cost of pills...$8 to $10 a pop, regardless of the dosage...but it's worth it for a better sex life. Some (but not all) prescription drug plans even cover it! Younger guys, you really don't need it...it's not a magic b---r pill...you still need that manual or visual stimulation to get that erection. It's also one of the most overused drugs in history!"

ok first of all Jesus does not use magic........It's called being the most powerful God in all the universe and beyond.  secondly, He did forsee meth, He just didn't tell us about it because God doesn't tell us everything.  Did God tell us that we would be invovled in a war? Did God tell us that we would be attacked on 9-11? Did God tell us about any other drugs? I guess this is my point: God doesn't tell us some things because it's all part of the challenge;it's called having faith and perseverence.  \nP.S.  you should seek help on this meth thing.......maybe then you'll have a good argument."

The air conditioning unit is for an empty room of a certain volume.
First determine size of AC needed for the room based on room size and occupants. If the room is expected to have several people, a meeting room for example a larger BTU capacity maybe needed.\n\nThe manufacturer of the AC will have the Power (watts) and Current (amps) for the given line voltage.\nKeep in mind that a larger AC unit may require 220VAC vs the typical 120VAC.\n\nThe power is the same for both, but the Current is about half for the 220VAC unit vs the 120VAC unit. The 220VAC unit is more reliable. But not all rooms have the 220VAC service, which could require a new branch circuit to be installed.\n\n1000 BTU/h is approximately 293 Watts\n \nFor BTU to Electric conversion check out the following link:"

my religion is Bible-based, so that is the text that i will be focusing on.\n\nover the years archaeologists have used the Bible to find people, places, kings, kingdoms, and even entire civilizations that were previously thought to not exist.  they were in the Bible, but no one found them until they used the Bible to find them. \n\nthe Bible puts on a timeline a cataclysmic flood about 4500 years ago where everything was destroyed from the face of the earth.  the oldest tree discoevered dates to about 4500 years ago.  coincidence?  read on...\n\nin the late 1990's, the earths population topped 6 billion.  in 1810, it was just over 1 billion.  following the curve that these numbers give us, the human population was at it's beginning about 4500 years ago (where the Bible has 8 living people)\n\nthe first greek translation of the new testament was written 250 years BC (before christ).  it has in it over 300 prophesies pertaining to the life of the messiah; all of which were fullfilled by Jesus.  the odds of this all happening as written are monumental. \n\nGod proved that He surpasses time and space with the prophesies, that He created time and space with the intricacy of His creation, and that He loves time and space with the sacrifice He paid.  maybe the Bible was penned by men, but each and every word written was via divine inspiration from God Himself.  no man could accomplish that.  religion was created by man, as the simple definition of ""religion"" is ""man's quest for God""; however i believe in a different school of thought, and that is one of ""God desiring a relationship with His creation; specifically man.""  it isn't about being religious, it's about having a relationship with God."
"Balls in balls?
How many 1 inch diameter balls can fit inside a hallow 12 inch diameter ball?
True, the empty spaces must be taken into account.\nSpecifically, the packing density of balls in a hollow sphere is estimated to be equal to pi/squareroot(18)=0.74\n\nThat means that the volume of the 12 inch ball that is actually available is: 0.74*(4/3)*pi*r^3, r=12/2=6\n= 0.74*(4/3)*pi*6^3\n= 213.12pi\n\nVolume of 1 inch balls = (4/3)*pi*r^3, r=1/2\n= (4/3)*pi*(1/2)^3\n= (1/6)pi\n\nSo, the number of 1 inch balls that will fit inside the 12 inch ball is:\n213.12pi/(1/6)pi = 1278"
"Filter definition, help needed?
Is a butterworth filter defined as:\n\na) a filter with no ripple in the passband (whose poles happen to lie on a circle)\nb) a filter whose poles lie on a circle (which happens to give no ripple in the passband)\n\nor\nc) Something else\n\nIts for a proof so the distinction may be subtle, but I need to know where to start\n\nThanks
The Butterworth filter is one type of electronic filter design. It is designed to have a frequency response which is as flat as mathematically possible in the passband.

If it's a number like .750 or .999 it means the percent of gold.  .999 is the highest number used because there's no way to get all of the impurities out to call it 100%\n\nIf it's a number with a k, that stands for karat weight.  24k is basically 100% gold.  18k is 18/24 so it's equal to 75% gold or .750 (see example above)."

"Did God create us or was it evolution?

There is ample physical evidence that proves that evolution has taken place and continues to take place to shape the development and genetic variability of life on this planet.  \n\nSo evolution definitely exists.\n\nThe fact that evolution exists, however, does NOT mean that god does not exist.\n\nIf you believe in god (I don't, but evolutionary biology has no part in that belief), then there is no reason that god cannot be the hidden driving force behind the physical laws of the universe that work together to cause biological evolution to take place, and eventually lead to the evolution of sentient creatures such as human beings who are capable of a measure of understanding of god's universe.\n\nThe only discrepancy between a belief in god and an understanding of biological evolution is reconciling the hard, verifiable evidence of geology and paleontology with a literalist, fundamentalist reading of the first two chapters of Genesis.\n\nIt is only if you insist that Genesis MUST be absolutely, physically true that there is any conflict between the two.  Note that a literalist reading of Genesis also requires that the Earth be flat.  \n\nJust as the fact that the Earth is round doesn't disprove the existence of god, the fact that evolution occurs and has occurred to form the diversity of life seen today does not disprove god's hand in that process."
"i have runny nose and sore throat, wat should i do?

For the nose:     solution  of  salt, water, squirted a couple times a day will dry out the nose and help with the sinus.  I have used the salt from the kitchen... for immediate results. In large quantities a mix of karo syrup,salt and water is used.  Karo syrup  helps not dry out the nose from the salt.  The correct salt may be called: sea salt if you make your own mixture.   Drug store sells it pre made.  Boiling water over the stove adding some cloves from the spice rack also helps if you lean over it as it boils.  Drinking warm tea with a little lemon, honey helps the throat along with gargling with salt water. Lastly... drink chicken broth, chicken soup."
"What is the theory yof determining the hardness of water by EDTA titration?
What is EDTA?\nHow can I calculate the concentration of the metal ions?
Na2EDTA is a complex molecule. Its name stands for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid – disodium salt. The formula is Na2C10H14N2O8. Even though its name and structure are complex, you only need to know that: EDTA reacts with Ca+2 and Mg+2 in a one to one ratio as follows:\n:Ca+2 + EDTA-2 -----> CaEDTA\n\nMg+2 + EDTA-2 -----> MgEDTA\nThe formula mass of Na2EDTA dihydrate is 372.24 g/mole.Na2EDTA comes as a dihydrate(absorbs water from the atmosphere) which is efflorescent (literally means ""bursting into flower"" but in this case just means that it forms bubbles), you cannot reliably weigh out the desired number of grams. The salt may be fully, or only partially, hydrated at the time you weigh it. The result is that you cannot be certain that you have prepared the proper strength reagent of EDTA..therefore: you need to standardize the solution  The results of the titration is reported as mg of CaCO3/liter.\nTo convert Calcium plus Magnesium (meq/L) Hardness as CaCO3 (mg/L) 50\nOf course since Fe and Mg and Ca and other metals are also present in water it is better (more accurate) to titrate for each metal species individually and calculate the hardness using the results of the individual results. EDTA hardness is sometimes referred to as ""Total hardness""and is reported as "" Hardness as mg/l CaCO3."""
"meaning of science?

Science originally just meant knowledge, especially specialized knowledge.  During 1700's it came to be used to to refer specifically to what was then known as natural philosophy, that is, the methodical study of natural phenomena.\n\nToday, science generally refers to the acquisition of knowledge by the scientific method, or to the knowledge thus gained. Briefly, the scientific method consists of identifying a problem, gathering data, formulating a hypothesis, and testing the hypothesis against the data, gathering more data if needed. Successful hypotheses can be built into theories, which are comprehensive explanations of the workings of some part of nature."

"why do things that are spinning look to be going backwards at certin speeds?

The retina doesn't capture continuous movement. In fact, the retina ""takes a picture"" about every 1/30 second of what we are looking and sends that image to the brain. This continuous snapshots gives us the perception of movement. \nSo when we are looking at a wheel that is spinning fast, the eye will be taking images at certain points, that will match or mismatch with the wheels rays. Depending on the velocity of the wheel, we will have the perception that it is going forward, stopping, or going backwards."
"Should undocumented immigrants be granted amnesty?
If yes, why? If no, why not? \n\nPlease take into consideration the long term effects of your answer. \n\nThank you.
Some yes, some no. \n\nI think those that have been here for 15 years, can pass a literacy test and swear alligiance to the US and who can substantiate that they have worked most of their time here or are a spouse of a worker I think they should be granted amisty . The 15 year period has to be unbroken. That is no deportations or arrests during that time period. I also feel they must renounce citizenship in the country of origion. Something we don't do for most imigrants but the fact they arrived here illegally I think is justification for more stringent requirements. \n\nFor those here less than that or ones we keep deporting and catching again. No I think we should grant them no amisty. I feel that the majority of them do not want to be Americans except for economic gain and do not believe in the US. Nor that they would have anything like the tolerance we have for them if the posisitions were reversed.  I think they would throw us out on our ear in a heart beat. Often they do even here. Try to get a job working at a place where mostly illegals work. If the boss is an illegal you'll find that the job is not availible for people of a different ethnic group. \n\nI think blanket amesty would be to revive racial/ethnic/religious prejudice in the nation. I think we will fragment along these lines and encourage even more enemies of the US to come here. While the majority of illegals come here just for work. They have been recruited en masse by legals once here by various racist organizations such as LULU. \n\nI also think that unemployment will reach new heights as most of these former illegals will suddenly want better paying jobs that do not exist and be replaced by illegals. With our welfare system already near collapse this would be just enough to end most social services for the poor for all Americans I feel. \n\nThen there is a secondary issue. If we allow these people to become Amercians in mass. It opens the door for relitives to come over here outside of quotas. So if we give 3 million illegals amesty then we have just brought over 10 million other relitives of these 3 million. I don't think the US could survive such an influx of people, especially when the bulk of them will be of a single non-English speaking ethnic  group. Remember legal US citizens have the right to bring over direct family members legally and unaffected by quotas."

"What is the name of the device paramedics use to pump air into patients to help them breathe?

A bag-valve-mask is the device that we position over the patient's nose and mouth to force air into the lungs.  In some cases, we will endotracheally intubate a patient (put a tube into their windpipe) that will allow us to provide better ventilation for the patient.  In this case, we attach the bag-valve device to the endotracheal tube.\n\nIn some advanced care situations, we can also attach the endotracheal tube to an automated ventilator (sometimes called a respirator).  There are a few variations of these devices, but they all work on basically the same principal - they force air into the patient's lungs, then allow the patient to naturally exhale."
"how do you promote a business legally through email, without spamming?

1.  Put out an email newsletter that provides useful information.  For example, I subscribe to a few newsletters sent out by online stores that interest me.  One is Woodcraft (a merchant with a good web presence and good bricks and mortar stores).  Their site, as well as their newsletter, provide good how-to info and some links to project plans, etc.\n\n2.  Make sure your audience is truly targeted and wants to read your email -- Put up a way, on your site or at your business location, for a customer to sign up for your email newsletter/catalog.  Also, make sure there's a very easy way to unsubscribe.  It does no good to annoy people.  They just might decide to come back at a later date.  That is, unless you annoy them.  You could actually lose sales by spamming people.\n\n3.  Once you've accomplished the two points above, provide coupons or sale codes in your email.  Folks love a good sale.  You might also try contests.  Using Woodcraft as an example again, they hold carving contests every year -- Best Santa wins.  It's a lot of fun and while I don't carve, I enjoy going to the site to look at the entries.\n\n4.  Follow all laws, rules and regulations -- CANSPAM, although it's mostly useless, does have some rules you need to follow.  For example, having a real postal address and a way to unsubscribe.\n\nIf you offer merchandise or services I'm interested in, I just might sign up, but don't feel offended if I don't.  It only means I'm not one of the customers you should target.  Not wasting bandwidth on non-customers is good for me, good for you and good for the millions of potential customers that are out there.\n\nGood luck!"

"Would a plugged-in hair dryer in the jacuzzi really kill everyone?
It seems to me that since the power cord on the hair dryer is insulated, the only conductors exposed to water are two closely spaced conductors inside the dryer.  Since these are within inches of each other, wouldn't the fields be concentrated like a dipole field in the few inches surrounding the exposed sections, and fall off as a high order function of distance?  Thus, it seems like people sitting several feet away in the tub would experience very little potential.  I'm curious, but I'm not ready to try it just yet.

"any opinions on this article about stress do u agree with it. what do you think about it?
As we remember our cultural differences, let us also remember our similarities. One of these is stress. As humans, when we become stressed, the ""fight or flight"" response kicks in. The adrenaline rush that wreaks havoc with our autonomic nervous system causes a host of annoying symptoms: sweaty palms, pounding heart, ""butterflies"" in the stomach, skin-tingling sensations, a slight fuzzy headedness or mild disorientation, tightness in various muscles, and other common signs of stress. Unrelieved or prolonged stress can initiate or aggravate various diseases or conditions. In other words, stress is universal to the human condition, and too much of it is not a good thing. \n\nSome causes of stress and the ways people have found to relieve stress may differ across cultures. For example, people in Western cultures tend to be time bound. The clock is a central part of their lives, and punctuality is a desired trait to be cultivated. Lateness, at best, betrays a lack of organization. At worst, the latecomer reveals a lack of consideration for others' time. A person who shows up late for an appointment is sure to cause stress in those who are left waiting. In some Latin cultures, however, time is no big deal. For example, a ten o'clock appointment in real time may mean anytime before noon. People in these cultures may feel stressed by others who insist that ten o'clock means ten o'clock. \n\nPeople relieve stress in different ways. Relaxation techniques, meditation, and massage therapies are common to many cultures although their specific practices and methods may differ. Some of the best stress relievers are those that individuals come up with based on a consideration of their preferences and needs. For example, some find relief in a favorite hobby or activity. For some, a workout at the gym relaxes them. For still others, reading is a favorite escape from the day's cares. \n\nStress can be the result of poor organization or inadequate preparation. For example, students who put off studying until the night before a test or who put off writing a research paper until the week before it is due are almost certain to experience stress and perhaps even failure, which will result in more stress. Although this kind of stress can be prevented, some stress is natural to certain events and circumstances and must be dealt with as it arises. Following is a list of common stressors that may affect people in many cultures: \n\nPersonal injury    Death of a pet \nDeath of spouse or family member    Increase in rent or other payments \nSerious illness   Traffic or road conditions \nBeing downsized or fired from a job   Change in government \nCareer change   Promotion at work \nMoving to a new city, state, or country    Losing a friend \nDivorce    Debt \nArgument with spouse   Lack of sleep \nLoss of income   Change in eating habits \nDamage to home or vehicle    Having to learn a new skill \n\nWhat causes stress in your life? What can you do to prevent stress in those situations over which you have control? What ways have you found to cope with the stress that results from unexpected events?
What causes stress?\n\n1.  Illness of aging parents and in-laws\n2.  Rearing a pre-teen\n3.  Keeping up with housekeeping while working full-time\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n1.  Encourage them to get regular check-ups and get treatment for on-going medical problems\n2.  I'm open for suggestions on this one - all I can do is love and encourage him thru the lows and celebrate with him during the highs!\n3.  Realize that in all actuality, my house is probably cleaner than most stay-at-home Mom's, and as long as the kitchen and bathrooms are relatively germ-free - we're okay!\n\nCoping?\nPlain and simple - I pray!  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that since God created me, He knows what's going on in my life and exactly how I'm feeling.  He even promised in His word that He wouldn't put more on us that we can bear!  He is my source of Joy and Peace and I couldn't make it through a day without Him - God bless!!!"
"Are birds mammals?  Why, or why not?

No, birds are not mammals. Modern systematics (phylogenetic systematics or cladistics) define all groups by shared derived characters - synapomorphies-. Thus, mammals as a crown group (that is, considering only all the living species and their latest common ancestor) are tetrapod vertebrates with fur, with lower jaw formed by a single bone (the dentary), middle ear with three ossicles, and which nurse their young with milk. There are more characteristics of the group, but any animal that fulfills these conditions is a mammal.\nThe crown-group of birds (Aves) includes vertebrates with feathers, with a beak covered in a horny sheath, lacking teeth, and which lay eggs with a special shell mineralization type; also they have several skeletal specializations. However, many of these traits are shared with non-avian archosaur reptiles (especially dinosaurs) - which is why I mentioned the crown-group. \nThese characteristics of birds and mammals are mutually exclusive. The last common ancestor of these groups was a basal Paleozoic amniote, because the reptile line that gave origin to mammals (the Synapsida) was already differentiated by the end of the Paleozoic, whereas birds evolved within the Archosauria (Sauropsida diapsid reptiles) in the Mesozoic Age."
"Where do investors find details about  the revenue streams of companies in terms of top clients etc?
For example:\nI read the 10q at sec.gov for (ABI).  Their CONSUMABLES AND SOFTWARE TO ANALYZE NUCLEIC ACIDS could be conected to the big pharmas. However, neither the 10q, 10k, or 8k told me who their top clients are. I want to know who ABI's customers are.\nRegards,

"Tell me about this SCAM please. International Money Transfers. How do they work?
I keep getting Yahoo 360 emails concerning differant people who want to hire someone for a percentage of whatever. They want to give me 7000 in checks and money orders to cash with me keeping 700.00. Thus supposedly avoiding International transfer fees. How does this work. I understand its a scam. I think.
They send you checks which you deposit into your checking account.  You then have to immediately write checks to another account.  The problem is, the checks they sent you bounce in a few days and they've stripped your own account out of all of its money and you get penalized by your bank for writing bad checks."

"what is the appropriate behavior and time period after loss of a parent?

Each person is different based on a number of factors including the relationship you had with that parent, the age of your parent at death as well as your current age, how your parent died and your personal feelings about death.

"If you hit a tennis ball over a net. When the ball reaches max height, it speed is?
Options are: less than initial speed, g*t, equal to its initial, zero, greater than initial.
I think you have left off part of the question. The speed of a ball is a vector. When you hit the ball, the vector points upward and forward. Gravity pulls the vector downward. Small forces (air friction, etc.) retard the total speed, but assume those can be ignored.\n\nAt some point, the pull of gravity will pull the vector to point down instead of up. That's the maximum height. The horizontal component of the speed vector should not change (given our assumptions). It still goes forward at the initial velocity. However, The vertical component is instantaenously at zero. In a moment, the ball will start to accelerate vertically and the vector will continue to pull down below the horizontal line becuase of the force of gravity.\n\nIf this were not true, the ball would reach maximum height and then just drop from the sky (0 overall velocity) which you know it does not do.\n\nSo of your choices, probably equal to initial or ever so slightly les than initial would be the best.\n\nThe same thing happens if you drop, say, a ball from 10 feet and fire a bullet from a height of 10 feet. The both hit the ground at the same time.The fact that the bullet is speeding horizontally doesn't affect gravity pulling on it vertically. (yeah small effects like curvature of the Earth, wind resistance, etc. being ignored)."
"What is happening in countries other than the USA in the creation/evolution debate arena?

Reporting from Argentina :-)\nThere is no such debate here. I work as a teacher and I've been both in public and private colleges, and also in a religious (catholic) one. \nEvolution is accepted and taught everywhere that I'm aware of. \nAlso, the only creationists I know belong to christian evangelist minorities. Two of my best friends are creationists and we've never argued over the matter.\nCatholics here are not intransigent or bigoted; I'm sure there are some who believe in a litteral interpretation of the Bible, but they keep to themselves. \nI'm aware of the debate in the USA, mostly because  in the Evolution course I took we used US textbooks and they had whole chapters about it. We skipped those ;)\nI think it's very sad."

"Ripped off big time. What should I do?
I'm a professional musician. I was hired to play 5 nights a week at a swanky Palm Beach restaurant (Deco). The owner seemed very nice. After working there for 2 weeks he gave me a check made out to cash (which at first I didn't realize). I went to cash it and the bank told me there were insufficient funds. I went to the owner who said it was a mistake and I should try again in a couple of days and everything would be fine. I don't know why. maybe I'm an idiot but I believed him and kept working there. One night Governor Bush even came in. To make a long story short I worked there for a month and haven't been paid a dime. He owes me $2000. I looked into small claims court and it costs $200 to file and my friend told me it's hard to collect. Not only did I not get paid but I spent a couple of hundred on gas and turned down other jobs. Am I just screwed?
Do you have a contract or something that says he'd pay you?  Did you fill out any employment forms (ie tax forms?).  If not you could start with the State Dept of Labor since he's trying to pay you under the table (and that would probably cheat the state out of unemployment or the tax form you need at the end of the year for your taxes).\n\nBut you mentioned Gov Bush came in.  So it must be a high profile restaurant.  Maybe go to a local TV station and see if they want to do an expose on an uneithical business."

I'm just curious how astronomers locate easily a star by knowing these two astronomical terms.

"Is it like this in the US?
I live in Bolivia in South America. Sometimes, the priest at our church sends his helpers round the houses in his parish and wants money for the church. if we do not give money someimes the helpers will push into the houses and hurt the women or even take them to the priest himself so he can have his way with us. I lost my virginity to him a few years ago and I was very young. It was horrible. There is nothing we can do because he is a man of God and God would strike us down if we rebelled against him, but I was wondering if it is like this in the US too? Thanks for your time.

"why is the middle of the fire blue ?

This is the part of the flame where ample oxygen is available for complete oxidation of vapors.  This blue flame occurs most often when supplemental oxygen is forced into the flame.  An example of this is best observed with welding torches --  such as acetylene torches.  With oxygen cut off, the flame is all yellow.  But as oxygen is added, the flame becomes blue -- and much hotter as well!"

"Can wellbutrin fix an irregular menstrual cycle?
Before I got on wellbutrin I'd have maybe 3 periods a year.  Now they are like clockwork and I've not had significant weight changes, diet changes or any other major lifestyle change that would also explain this sudden regularity.  To tell you the truth, it's kind of a bummer! (irony noted).
I was on Wellbutrin for a few years....never regulated my periods.But that's probably because I was on other medications as well. It's more likely hormonal....sometimes when you are depressed it throws you off cycle. When your chemicals are balanced due to the wellbutrin, it could have put your hormones back in order.And could be that maybe the type of depression you had played a major role in your hormone levels....depression meds are tricky like that!"

"Vanguard Target Retirment funds V.S. managing your own investments?
I am 21 years old and I am currently investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market index fund. I have been thinking about moving the money to the target retirement fund for my age, I seriously get the impression though that vanguard allocates too much to very low risk investments and too fast, If i were to invest it in right now i think its about 7% bonds, and it increases every year till retirement. Does anyone else thing that those funds are a little too cautious? \n\n     I was thinking about also just sticking with Total Stock Market Index and maybe add a International index fund as well, what do you guys think?\n\n     Is there a specific age where I should start worrying about risk and shifting to bonds, etc.?
The Target Retirement Funds are a ""one size fits all"" approach, and not everyone has the same risk tolerance.  If you are sure you can stomach the volatility of 100% stocks then invest in 100% stocks for retirement.  I would suggest about 20% or so foreign stocks, for a slight decrease in your volatility.  If you have some money outside an IRA invest some of that portion in foreign stocks for the Foreign dividend tax credit.  Note that the Target Retirement funds invest ~20% in foreign stocks, but they can't offer the foreign tax credit because of the way they are structured.\n\nIf you are investing solely for retirement, 100% stocks may be a good idea.  Remember to fund other goals, like a rainy day fund for when you lose your job.  (It happens to the best.) Layoffs are most likely when the economy and stock market are down.   You also need to save for a down payment on a house.  Do you want to delay buying a house because the market is down 50%?\n\nThere is no magic age at which you have to start converting to bonds.  Off the top of my head, I would suggest 20-30 years before retirement.\n\nBefore investing in 100% stocks take their quiz to see if you have the stomach:"
"what is the validity period a sale agreement if no time limit is mentioned in the agreement?

This really depends upon the state and the contract (assuming that is that by sale agreement you mean contract for sale).\n\nMost form contracts will have a specific date written in for the closing.  If not, they have provisions that would require a closing within 30 to 60 days of the effective date (date when contract was made).\n\nIf there are no provisions for a timeline, then you'd have to find out what your state laws regarding real estate contracts would say is a 'reasonable' amount of time to complete the transaction.\n\nHave to admit though, it sounds to me like if there is no dates or timeline listed any where, not even a blank that says, 'if blank closing to be within 30 days', you might not have a legitamate contract for sale."

"Is this legal?
At a grocery store downtown, there is a little ""bulletin board"" type thing near the cash register that has copies of ""bad checks.""  This wouldn't bother me much, it's just the fact that these checks include the names and addresses of the people who wrote them.  Now, mind you, I do not endorse bouncing your checks, but I know one of these people, and she is a single mother of three who accidentally wrote a bad check.  Is it legal to post these checks?  If it is/isn't, what is a legal clause/law supporting or refuting it?  Thanks!
I think it is legal to list the names of these people, but it is dangerous for the store to print their names, addresses, and account numbers (if they are just making copies of the checks and putting them up) in one general location. This is a breeding ground for identity theft and the store should be more careful. Your friend should complain about having her information posted."

A truth is not necessarily seen by Eyes.\n\nThere are things out there which our senses dont percieve but it does not mean that these does not exist. \n\nYou cannot see bacteria's and single cell organisms before the invention of microscopes. But they did exist and were part of truth. \n\nYou cannot see air\n\nYou cannot see sound waves\n\nWhat we see is not necessarily true. e.g Illusion. If you see image of  Moon in water bowl, that does not mean that there are two moons. You see Mirage. but that does not mean it exist. \n\nHow can you prove that you exist and you are not just an image or perception. ?
Philosophers have wrangled with this question for centuries and I comes down to this:  You simply cannot prove that you exist.  You can't even prove that the outside world exists.  After all, 'you' could just be a brain in a vat somewhere being stimulated by electrodes that make you 'see', 'feel', and 'touch'.  What philosophers have come up with is the concept of a ""Properly Basic Belief"".  It means that if there is no evidence whatsoever to the contrary, then you can probably safely assume that it's true.  However, that doesn't mean you can prove it.  And of course you have to be open to the possibility that evidence may turn up at some time.  So until there is evidence that I don't exist, I'll stick with the philosophers and say it's a ""Properly Basic Belief"" that I exist.  And of course, there's the old standby of ""I think, therefore I am."""
"Do you have a favourite constellation?
Which is your personal favourite and why?\n\nMine is Orion, simply because it is so easily recognizable in my night sky. I always look for it when I'm outdoors on a clear night and I never fail to gaze upon it with wonder.
yes also orion for winter... it is beautiful and easy to find. \n\n i enjoy watching the skies.  there's a dark sky here, so i can see things many people might not be able to.  every once in a while, i'm blessed to see a meteor shower or a display of the northern lights... it's ungodly.\n\ni also enjoy the changing night sky throughout the seasons... the big dipper and bootes in spring, the northern cross in summer, and pegasus in fall (which means orion's on his way back soon).  whatever else changes in life, these will always remain constant... and that is why i appreciate them."
"I suffer from rosecea and need a good home remedy. Have been to several dermatoligists?
I've had oral antibiotics, topicals, even take luke warm showers so as not to irritate, but am at a loss as to what to do next.  The thing is that I have been to several dermatoligists appointments and followed the regimen but it always comes back, usually worse, so I am a little put off by having to go back to the dermatoligists again since I do not have insurance for this.  Also I noticed that tanning actually seems to help but every doctor or website I visit tells me the opposite.  My rosacea is coupled with outbreaks of acne like symptoms.
Hi mbmare5!  I hope I can help you a little.  I too, was diagnosed with Rosacea.  I'm 42 years old & have been a bit of a sun worshipper all of my life.  Like you, I have always found that getting sun improves my condition although the doctors may just try to attribute that to the fact that having a tan may makes your whole face look a bit redder.  (I don't know if I buy that one).  I haven't gotten the acne-like symptoms, that must be upsetting to you.  \n\nThere are two things that you haven't mentioned. The first is spicy foods, the second is the prescription Metrogel (which I believe comes in a creme as well).  Many doctors say that spicy foods cause Rosacea outbreaks & this seems to make some sense to me.  If you are like me & love spicy foods, try cutting them out to see if your condition improves.  Also, I have been using Metrogel.  In the beginning I was constantly forgetting to use it daily, so it never helped at all.  When I got myself on a regular regimen, twice a day, it made a noticeable difference.  Please try this if you have not, but remember that this is not a cure, so if you stop using it, your condition will usually go back to the way it was before you ever started using it.\n\nYou've probably heard all of this before, but if not, I hope it helps a bit.  Remember, since Metrogel can't do any HARM anyway, don't quit until you've used at least one full-size tube. I'm still out in the sun & at this point I think I'm the only one who even knows I have it!\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you'd like.  mrdoolin1"

"Why some christians think that love between gays is not valid?
This whole discussion on gay marriage by the Christian community has been based on the theory that between two gay men or women cannot morally exist a loving union as strong as a ""normal"" family sustained in a father-mother structure. Some have even argued that gay marriage puts the ideal of the perfect family in jeopardy. I think that family is based in love and in healthy relationships between its members more than in a structure based on gender. Even when you look at statistics, it is obvious that children raised by gay parents are as healthy as any other children, so I don’t understand what is it that makes some Christians believe that same sex love invalidates marriage and family. So, why is it that some think that gay marriage will destroy family as we know it?
I agree with what you are saying. And I think some christians get hung up on certain scriptures about same sex relationships because they don't understand those scriptures in context. \n\nGood articles on that here:\nhttp://www.mccchurch.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/SexualitySpirituality/Sexuality_Spirituali.htm\n\nFollow up: Do you see what I mean about all the people who don't understand those scriptures in context? Not one of them can be bothered with reading the articles and learning something new. It is a shame to see people so close minded."

"are people on salary entitled to overtime pay?

Salary is the way you are paid, not the classification of a job. There are two classifications Exempt & Non-Exempt.  It depends on the state & federal laws which one applies to your job. The link below will explain in detail which jobs are which. \n\nBTW: It does not matter what the employer says - the employer can say whatever they want. What matters is what the law says it is.

"Help finding problem in calculations with predicted tennis ball launch distance for physics project?
For our physics class we have to make a tennis ball launcher and we are also responsible for doing calculations to predict the distance our launcher will be able to launch the tennis ball.\n\nI have done the calculations here and can be seen in this PDF file:\nhttp://imusion.net/backup/yahoo.pdf\n\nThe diagram of our launcher can be seen in here:\nhttp://imusion.net/backup/yahoo.jpg\n\nI have looked through it but I know it is wrong.  For u = 0.5kx^2 which is the first equation, x is the distance we can stretch the bungee cord which is supposed to be 1.2m and not 1.2-0.955(0.955 being the ""slack "" length of the cord).  The problem is if I use 1.2m for x and follow through with everything else I get a ridiculous number like 500m.  Which I know is not right.\n\nJust a short explanation of what else I did for the calcs.   After I found the PE of our bungee cord I found the velocity then used projectile motion.\n\nIf anyone can look through what I did and see what I did wrong I would appreciate that.
Your calculations look pretty good.  \nYour assesment of what is a ridiculous answer is a bit lacking.\n\nYour cals use a 1.2-.955 = .245m deflection.  When you change .245 to 1.2, you increase the energy by (1.2/.245)² = 23.99.\n\nSo, with about 24 times as much energy, I would bet without calculating that it will go 500m......."

"Can you prove evolution to a creationist?

No, almost by definition, a creationist believes what they do based on faith, even in the presence of overwhelming information disputing creationism.  If a delusional person believes they are Ceasar, for example, you cannot ""prove"" to them that they are not, no matter what evidence you give.  I don't mean to say creationists are delusional, just that a belief based upon faith is one that, by definition, neither needs any evidence nor is swayed by evidence.  In addition, evolution isn't ""proven"" it's just an extremely powerful theory that has a great deal of evidence supporting it, no real evidence disputing it, and seems to describe the real world as we know it very accurately."

"can heat transfer in vaccum?

No, the wave propagates as light through the vacuum of space.  The heat produced by the sun is caused by the interaction of the wave (light) and some other object (your skin).  There must be a secondary object.

"please think about it or if i have a misconception please clear my doubts?
elements known to us are made up of molecules, molecules contain atoms atoms are made up of e-, p+ and neutrons now as it is said everything in this universe is made up of particle or waves and both are related to energy so apart from properties there is no basic difference between these elements as they are made up of one and the same thing wht is an electron proton or a neutron please tell me how come there is energy all around us but we cannot extract it energy can never be destroyed so universe can never end and thus there is no limit of existence whts it all please tell me i
Yes, everything around us is made of protons, neutrons, electrons or photons (light) for the most part. We can't extract the energy (usually) because it is already in the lowest state possible or there is no way to get to a lower state. It is only when we give it a chance to go to a lower energy state (by chemical reactions, etc) that we get energy out.\n\nAs to whether the universe can never end....it certainly can't as long as we stay away from singularities where the law of energy conservation is violated. Unfortunately, General Relativity predicts such singularities."

Urchin (now Google Analytics) is free.  If you have the money, Coremetrics, Omniture are the big players.  All use a javascript tag that goes on each page.

"why does popularity matter in highschool?

The type of popularity highlighted in The Breakfast Club and Mean Girls, is actually a relatively new phenomenon in our culture. In a nutshell, it can be seen as the consequence of teenagers living in a consumer society, a society whose economic existence depends on people constantly having a desire to consume.  Marketers, in various ways, create artificial premium importance on many goods by convincing teenagers that -- by consuming them -- they will gain social acceptance.  This drive to be accepted, though natural for social creatures like humans, is compounded by the fact that objects and group affiliation now offer a tangible way of 'declaring' just how accepted someone is.  For example, the 'preps' who wear Abercrombie and are always seen at the shopping galleria can declare their popularity by buying a certain brand of clothing, which marketers have manipulated their peers into thinking makes them more popular than someone who wears Brand X.  Further,  teenagers in a consumer society have far more free time and disposable income than did teenagers just a century ago.  Time that would have been spent doing chores or working in the field, is today used by teenagers to contemplate their popularity and to work on improving it."

"How does a Homing missile Home?

Most homing missiles, such as the Aim-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, home in on the heat emitted by a target. This is detected by infrared detector arrays in the nose which are built into a feedback control system that directs the missile to the target.\n\nOther homing missiles detect targets that are illuminated by a laser designator. This designator can be mounted on an aircraft or other vehicle from where the missile is fired, or the target can be illuminated by a separate entity on the ground who might have a better view of the situation. The laser is in the infrared frequency range, so can not be seen by the unaided eye.\n\nOthers, such as cruise missiles use GPS or compare detected terrain to onboard terrain maps to follow a course to the target.\n\nRadar is another method that is useful for air or water targets."
"Anger problem?
Hi:) I think I may have an anger problem.  I am 31 years old and have suffered some pretty tough times. I was abused as a child in all catagories. No need to tell you the specifics I think you can figure it out! I was tormented every day. In school and at home. I got made fun of everyday at school because of my clothes. My mom was poor and on welfare. I remember having 4 pairs of jeans and 4 tee shirts. Not so long ago my mother died from a drug overdose as well as natural causes in which the drugs contributed. I was devestated. Could all these lead to they way I feel now? Everytime I see a wisper and someone looking at me I automatically assume they are talking about me and engage in serious confrontation! I am smart! But I can't seem to get my emotions under control! I was kicked out of the military with a broken hand from a boxer's fracture. They said I was unfit for military duty. I was discharged for a ""personality disorder"". I don't want sympathy, Just want to be happy!

Well mate, ask this question and you should close, or hire new marketing people.\n\nFirst of all, you may want to get a place that costs less per month.\n\nSecond, you need to get more visitors per day.\n\nThird, of those 15 customers that come in, how many buy? You need to try find out with the ones that don't buy, why they didn't, and don't come across as desperate.\n\nElaborate you may ask? Well, is there any cheaper places you can rent thats cheaper and has the same sort of coverage?\n\nAre you advertising? If you are, maybe you need to rethink your advertising strategy, where you are advertising, what info you have on your advertisment. Do you have a good name? People won't want to buy from you if you got a bad name. Do you sell good products? Are your products priced right? Do some window shopping at your competitors and if their prices are less than yours, and you can't possibly put your pricing that low, get new suppliers that give you better pricing, if you make your own furniture, find ways of reducing production costs.\n\nWhen your customers come in, are they treated well? Do they get helped in time and do the people helping them know their products?\n\nYou may also try thinking out the box."
"How do I find the SD on a TI-83 PLUS calculator??

Specifically: press STAT, then ENTER. This takes you to the lists. Put in a value and press enter, and continue until all your values are entered into the list. \nThen press STAT again. This time use the arrow key to move to CALC, then press 1-Var Stats. Then press 2nd then watever list you entered the data into. List one would be 2nd then 1 key, list two is 2nd and 2 key.

"Why would a Mexican or anyone would say 'Viva la Raza' ?
It means 'long-live the race'.  Isn't that a odd comment to make?  I mean if you saw a bunch of white people say long live the race, wouldn't you find that a bit weird or even bordering racist?  \n\nMost Mexicans are a mixture of native and spanish blood, so technically it really isn't even 'a' race....thus I guess 'the race', which is newly created.  Long-live the Mongoloid/Caucasoid race? *shrug*\n\nTell me, what makes one say that?  \n\nPlease refrain for insults or racism if you decide to answer.\n\nnote: I was raised by a American of Mexican descent (ie she was born there but got married to american), and I have lived with many individuals that lived in Mexico,...yet I don't really hear that from any of them, and I really don't feel like asking them.   Thus I leave the plaform open to you.
It's just a sense of pride.\nI am Mexican American, both my parents are Mexican and well, in my opinion, I don't see it as slighty racist..\nI see it as the way Americans are proud of being Americans,\nHow is ""Viva la Raza"" any different from ""Proud to be an American"" or ""Get-R-Done"" ? Pretty sure you have also heard of ""brown and proud""\nthat is basically what it means...\nBeing proud of who you are :D\nI have said it plenty of times when  I see someone of Mexican descent accomplish something great in life or have done something positive for the community"

i was hurt at work  they r saying that its a spianed mussle of the upper back now im haveing swelling in the left leg after 4 months they are saying the same thing ! workmans comp of course . just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.
Edema means swelling. That's all. there are other factors involved if u have swelling 4 months after an incident. Talk to a different doctor to find out the reason why your leg is swelling. it could be any number of things. Also, when you have swelling, apply a cold pack(not HOT Please) to the area for 15 minutes and then remove. wait half an hour and then repeat. your swelling should go down, but u still need to talk to a doctor so they can test u to see where the problem lies."
"Why do people?
Go out to dinner at a restaurant with out a reservation?  No so bad with groups under 6 but over 6 people should make the restaurant aware they are coming.  Don't you think?
I think it really depends on the restaurant. If it's a casual dining establishment, I can't imagine they much care. Management is just looking at the ""bottom line"" and wouldn't even consider turning 6 or more people away!\n\nA ""fine dining"" restaurant is a whole different set of rules. Reservations are an absolute must! Most of them require reservations no matter how many are in the party.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's just good etiquette and good sense to alert any ""sit down"" dining establishment that you're going to be there. Especially when it's going to be more than two people."
"Whats the best way to get rid of SOCIAL ANXIETY?
I have social anxiety because I used to do drugs. And I dont believe in taking a Prescription drugs, because its like taking more drugs to solve a problem that was caused by taking drugs in the first place. I mostly have anxiety when going somewhere where theres lots of people having conversation that I don't know well.
Hi Pablo, I too suffer from social anxiety.Believe me I understand your frustration and sadness about it. Ok well, firstly I have to tell you that as a result in doing drugs -you have created an imbalance in your brain. I know this cos i did drugs for years to hide from my problems. This rapidly reduced the seratonin in my brain. You need seratonin to feel happiness. Anyway, the point of telling you that, is that you may need to take a short dose of seratonin tablets. Lexapro is especially used for panic disorders and anxiety.(ive started it myself recently and it is working) I didnt agree with tablets either for the same reason as yourself, but the point is, the reason youre feeling like this is because of a chemical imbalance.\nSome things that will help you in the mean time are: You have to cut out coffee and sugary foods from your diet. Cut down on alcohol also. This is just for a little while. These things actually make you feel more anxious.\nIf you are feeling particularly anxious, the best thing to do is go for a power walk. Exercise really helps get rid of that anxious feeling.\nYou need to go to a cognitive therapist then, to help you find out why you feel like this in social situations.You know,get to the root of the problem.The cognitive therapist will tell you how to control your anxiety and what triggers this etc.\nThen you need to join a group of people that are going through the same thing as yourself. It will make it easier to go to group therapy ( your cog.therapist will probably refer you later on)until you feel comfortable in social situations.\nI know its daunting..but youve made the first positive step by asking for help. It is a long road, but you will make it through. You are not alone in feeling like this.\nPlease get help as soon as you can because, it can get worse over time. I made the mistake of thinking that i could get over it myself, but over 5 yrs it got progressively worse. \nI wish you all the luck in the world. Feel free to pm me as i am going through the daily battle of social anxiety myself.\nCheck out the website below to give you an idea that others feel as you do"

"What are the good/bad aspects af being a dental assistant? Is there much gore?
I know that there is some blood, and I don't have a super weak stomach, but I think that a lot of blood wouldn't sit too well.
Work for a regular dentist instead of say a periodontist who does surgeries to correct problems. Schooling is only about 9 months so if you don't like it there is always time to change your career again. Plus most interviews are working interviews where you go in for a day or two to work to see if they want to hire you or not. \nThere will be some blood of course because fo the field and gums bleed rather easily in some. The plus is its good money, here in Florida you can make about $16.00 hr working as an assitant for a periodontist. Decent money for little schooling ."

I don't like bullys. And it has been my experience that people usually attack others personally because they are unhappy about things in their own life.

As for class clowns, the ones I went to school with were cool and usually made jokes at themselves."

"Did Jesus really exist, or was he a fictional character?

"what are some concepts to the physics of the hydraulic car jack and the regular car jack?

Mechanical jacks are classic levers (fulcrums).  You apply a lesser force through a longer distance on the input in order to achieve a greater force over a lesser distance on the output.\n\nHydraulic jacks are based on the property of non-compressibility of liquids and uniform pressure throughout a static liquid.  You apply a given force to a small area on the input (the pump) which transfers that pressure to a larger area (the piston) thus amplifying the force (but again, reducing the distance)."

"Why the 9 months dont get count when we calculate the age.?

Because we are not yet an independently human being during this period of 9 months. Our body is bounded at our mother's body and the 2 bodies function like a system. When our fetus body is complete, so that we can use our own digestive system for the nutrition, comes the moment of the birth when we naturally break the connection. In this moment is beginning our own life as an independent human body (but of course we are independent only from the body-perspective, otherwise we depend of other people in the point nutrition, care etc.).\nThis theory of calculating the age is guilty only for the natural birth.I don't know how it shows in other situations : the clones, for example."
"Einstein's cosmological constant divided by energy density x c^4= Newtons gravity constant.?
Did Newton know about that but refused to elaborate an explanation?
Nope - Einstein created his cosmological constant in order to preserve the idea of a ""static"" universe, he felt that a changing (expanding or contracting) universe was unnatural as supported by his equations of gravity, so he created the constant specifically to maintain gravitational equilibrium through the universe as a whole.\n\nNewton's big ""G"" is just a constant relating the strength of the (far field) gravitational force to the chosen set of units.\n\nAlso, I'm not quite sure which version of the cosmological constant you are citing, as genrally the constant that comes out of the metric goes as:\n\nCosmological Constant = 8(Pi)*(G)*(energy density)"

Has it caused any serious side effects (which to me means facial hair or depression!!!) how do you like taking it so far?
i've been in women's health care for 10 years and have taken it off and on since it's introduction about seven years ago.\n\nside effects are so different from person to person as all of our own personal hormones are all slightly different. & some of us are more sensitive to certain ingested hormones.\n\nit does have an androgenic (male hormone) effect. it could, in theory cause facial hair growth in someone that already has a higher level of testosterone. (as women DO have testosterone in their bodies. just a much much lower level.) the drug ""DRSP"" has the androgenic effect. i love it because it helps with water retention. that's also an effect from the DRSP.\n\ni haven't had any patients complain about facial hair. and this is a pill that you USUALLY lose a few pounds WHEN you're switching from another pill that does not have DRSP. [there's only two: yasmin and Yaz. yaz has a teeny bit less estrogen in it.]\n\nany OCP (oral contraceptive pill) can cause depression as it is a hormone. i hadn't heard of a higher occurence of it from this pill. if you do start to have depression, it's good to have your thyroid checked, etc. most side effects (spotting, headache, nausea) go away after the third month.\n\np.s. all pills help with shorter periods, less flow, less cramps and clearer skin. however, only one has the clearer skin approval from the FDA. only because they are the only ones that spent tons of money researching that effect and they spent tons of money getting that part approved to put on their label by the FDA."
"what is shimla deputation?

The separatist and the loyalist tendencies among a section of the educated Muslims and the big Muslim nawabs and landlords reached climax in 1906 when the All India Muslim League was founded under the leadership of Aga Khan, the Nawab of Dhaka, and Nawab Mohsin-ul-mulk. Founded as a loyalist, communal and conservative political organisation, the Muslim League made no critique of the colonialism, supported the partition of Bengal and demanded special safeguards for the Muslims in government services. The Morley Minto reforms were introduced after the partition of Bengal based on communal lines. They furthered the notion of separatism as they introduced separate electorates under which all Muslims were grouped together in separate constituencies from which Muslims alone could be elected The Muslim League welcomed these reforms. With the help of Lord Minto, the League put forward and secured the acceptance of the demand for separate electorates despite The National Congress opposal to it."

"tell me about bermuda triangle?

The Bermuda Triangle is a region of the Atlantic Ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Florida, United States; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Bermuda.  The area inside these boundaries is approximately 1.5 million square miles (4,000,000 km²).\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle has a reputation for being an area where ships and airplanes dissappear, often under mysterious circumstances.  This reputation came to public awareness in the 1950s and became a household name in the 1970s, mostly due to ""The Bermuda Triangle"", a bestselling book written by Charles Berlitz.\n\nVarious explanations for the apparent high number of dissapperances have been put forward, ranging from the mundane to the hyper-fantastic.\n\nSkeptics contend that this region has a comparable rate of maritime and aerial incidents as any other similar sized region of the ocean.  They point out that Lloyd's of London, a world-reknowned insurer of maritime vessels, does not charge a higher insurance premium for ships that regularly traverse the triangle.\n\nScientific considerations for an increased dissaperance rate take into acount that this region experiences severe tropical storms and is the source of many hurricanes.  These storms create an increased danger to both ship and air traffic.\n\nRougue waves have also been put forward as a possible cause.  These rare waves can reach heights of as much as 100 feet (30 meters), easily swamping most ships.  Rouge waves, however, would have no effect on air travel.\n\nA third scientific explanation is methane hydrates.  Methane deposits on the ocean floor may release bursts of methane gas that reduces the density of the water it permeates. Since ships rely on displacement to stay afloat, a reduction of density in the water would cause a ship to immediately sink.  As the methane leaves the water and rises into the air, it would reduce the density of the air as well, thus reducing lift on aircraft, causing them to descend rapidly.  In addition, the methane would change the air mixture taken into the engines of the aircraft, causing the engine to stall.  While these events have not been witnessed in nature, they have been proven in lab experiments.\n\nMore exotic explanations for the Bermuda Triangle include it being an area of magnetic disturbance, temporal (or time) holes, the location of the lost city of Atlantis, or extra-terrestrial abduction.\n\nWhatever the reason, the Bermuda Triangle continues to be a source of inspiration for fiction writers of books, television programs and movies, often showing up attached to some sort of a conspiracy."
"Does an ionic cleansing bath actually rid a substantial amount of toxins from the body?
I had an ionic cleansing foot bath today and was surprised with the dramatic discolouring of the water. I found out later that the water will turn colour no matter what. Is the ionic cleansing foot bath a scientifically proven method of removing a substantial amound of toxins from the body?
No, The ionic cleansing foot bath is not a scientifically proven method of removing toxins.  Different manufactures of this device will have many documents claming the effectiveness of their device but none are even remotely proven scientifically.  You are right the color changes on the divice no matter what and you are not sucking toxins out of your body.  It comes down to simple placebo effect for people and if they get some relief.  Our skin is a fantastic barrier to the outside would and it keeps the smallest of things from getting in or out of our body.  Toxins do not leave our body through the skin and into this magic Ionic cleansing foot bath.  To explain this whole topic is vast and you would not want to hear it but here it is in a condensed form.  Our skin barrier will not let even the smallest of things ""viruses"" pass through either in or out of our skin.  We don't get sick because a virus passes through the skin on our hand, we get sick when we don't wash our hands and put the viruses on it up to our eyes, nose or mouth which we can then let the virus inside our body.  So if you can not even get this incredibly small virus through the skin you are not going to get the comparatively large heavy metals and complex large molecule like cholesterol through the skin as they claim.

Is it a good idea to invest in Banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America or Washington Mutual or other banking groups?\n\nive noticed that almost all of the banks grow over time, steadily but into very high ranges.\n\ndo you think Citigroup or Bank of America has the possibility of going higher??? cause what reasons are there for it to fall??? practically none in my opinion, i dont know i might be wrong. what do you think?\n\nis it a good idea to invest in new small banks or in old big bank companies?
Financial insitutions are the largest industry in the stock market by valuations... think about U.S. Economy is now a service based one and financial service is a big part of that.\n\nThe financial stocks normally are considered interest rate and economy sensitive, meaning the performance will be good in good times, compared to some industry that is less sensitive.\n\nThe stock selection is a pure personal matter, depending on your risk tolerance, investment goals etc.  I like the large bank because it is more diversified and less risky - small banks are more affected by regional economy or particular business.  Citi is a more global player than BOA."
"i haven't had a period for 1 yr and 5 months since i came off the Injection a yr ago whats wrong with me.?

nothing is wrong with you... everyones bodies react differently to stress, drugs, and well everything. many times there is a natural answer to the bodies symptoms, but in your case i would pop into your doctors office and get their opinion. it could be a lot of things causing this, you may even be ovulating and just not bleeding. do yourself a favor and go to your doctor, they will be much more believable for you than some peolple n the internet. good luck"
"I had a horse accident and now I get bad headaches ?!?!?
About 6 months ago I had a horse accident and injured my left shoulder and the left side of my neck . Now , I frequently get headaches(which I never did get), sometimes I just keep a head ache . Do you think I have a pinched nerve ?
If you haven't seen a doctor since the accident, I would suggest seeing one sometime next week.  Since this has been going on for 6 months, the urgency of an Emergency Room is unwarranted.  The possiblity of a pinched nerve does exist and massage therapy would do wonders as well as making the rest of your body feel good.  \n\nAlthough I'm not a big fan of chiropractors, a simple neck adjustment may be all that is needed.  I was involved in a rollover car accident a long time ago.  I would get throbbing headaches whenever I would stand up.  I saw a chiropractor out of the suggestion of my lawyer, and the headaches went away after one visit.  I hope this helps....good luck to you."
"Funniest thing?
What is the funniest thing you ever did?
ok, here goes. so me and some friends goto a bar and stay till closing at 2am. then we head to a house party on the beach with some marines. we drank with them some more, then decided to go skinny dippping, but were afraid to since it was dark and we thought there might be sharks.\nwe wait till the sun starts coming up at 7am. the guys take off with our clothes and leave me and my friend with 1 towel, which we are trying to share to cover up while gettin back to the house. they grab the towel, i let go, but my friend didn't, and got dragged though the bushes! we had to run across the street butt naked at almost 8 in the morning! she was getting a piggy back ride from another naked drunk guy, who drops her on her head in the middle of the road. so there she is on her back, legs in the air, spread eagle. at first we were worried until she burst out laughing! then we all got home and put like 4 people in one little apartment shower! one of the best times i have ever had!"
"Is King Henry the viii a god?
He started christianity so he could divorce his first wife.\nJesus was not a christian.\nSo how can it be true?
If you worship Henry the VIII, then he is a god.\nChristians get touchy about someone questioning their faith because they have always been told to never question. Simply believe what they are told. Faith is more important than insight to them. Insight can lead to reform. Reform can lead to a change in leadership. They are a control mechanism and do not tolerate anyone who 'threatens' their power by asking quesions about their beliefs."

"Seeking Website for doctors qualifacations & experience?
also want to know of any pending lawsuits or malpractice proceedings...
American Medical Association.\nInformation about a doctor's training and experience can usually be obtained from the doctor's office, a local medical society (a the doctor is a member), a local hospital (if the doctor is on staff), or an HMO to which the doctor belongs. A few state licensing boards issue information about disciplinary actions, but getting it may be cumbersome. Several online organizations provide easy access to various amounts of information. Internet Health Pilot has a handy listy of the medical and osteopathic licensing board Web sites.\n\nThe American Medical Association's AMA Physician Select provides limited information on the training and certification status of all of the more than 690,000 medical and osteopathic physicians currently licensed in the United States. It does not list disciplinary actions. Searches can be done only one state at a time. This service is free of charge.\n\nThe American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) CertifiedDoctor Verification Service can be used to check whether a doctor is certified by one of the 24 recognized specialty boards. The searches yield no other information. All states can be searched simultaneously. This site is primarily useful for checking the certification status of a doctor whose location is unknown. Registration at the site is required, but this service is free of charge.\n\nHealthGrades maintains a searchable database of medical and osteopathic physicians. Its reports cover education and training; specialties; board certification; disciplinary actions. and several other characteristics. Searching, which costs $7.95 for the first search and $2.95 for each additional search, requires the physician's last name and state of practice. The resultant information includes whether the doctor has been sanctioned within the past few years, but no details are provided. People seeking a new doctor in their own community can get a report that compares up to 20 of them for $9.95. Reports are also available for hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nThe most comprehensive database is ChoiceTrust, which charges $9.95 for a credential history and $19.95 for a one-day pass.\n\nPublic Citizen's Health Research Group, which operates the Questionable Doctors site, has stopped updating its database of disciplinary actions and is no longer accepting new subscribers.\nGovernment Sources\n\nMost states have Web sites with searchable databases, but the amount of information varies considerably from state to state. With respect to disciplinary actions, some provide brief summaries, some provide extensive documentation, and others simply say whether or not a disciplinary action has taken place. A few state boards provide information about malpractice suits and criminal convictions, but research at relevant courthouses is more likely to yield results. Searching Google may also yield such information. Internet Health Pilot provides a convenient list of the medical and osteopathic boards that maintain Web sites.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Inspector General administers two databanks that collect adverse information about physicians and other healthcare providers. The information is not available to the general public but can be accessed by government agencies, credentialing organizations, and certain other parties.\n\n    * The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB, which began operating in 1990, is intended to hinder the movement of ""problem practitioners"" from one facility or state to another. Licensing boards are required to report all actions that revoke, suspend, or restrict a license for reasons related to the practitioner's professional competence or conduct. Professional societies must report all professional review actions that adversely affect the membership of a physician or dentist. Hospital administrators must report disciplinary actions that negatively affect a doctor's clinical privileges for more than 30 days and must query the Data Bank w"

"what is the english translation of the fungi name,  Fusarium oxysporum?

Fusarium comes from the latin for spindle, referring to the general shape of the spores of this fungus.  oxy means sharp, or saw-toothed, and sporum refers to the spore itself.  So I would assume that the spores of this fungus are spindle shaped, with sharp or pointy bits sticking out from it.\n\nFusarium oxysporum is a common soil fungus, and can become a pathogen causing a wide variety of wilt diseases in plants (usually called Fusarium wilts).  It is also sometimes known as Agent Green.  no idea why.  Fusarium oxysporum can also sometimes infect people (and I presume other animals too).  usually it manifests as toenail or fingernail fungus, making them deformed and icky looking, but can also become a more generalized infection, especially in people with weakened or compromised immune systems.  some of these strains have become resistant to conventional antibiotics."

"Can you explain this in a simple way (see details)?
If you're listening to a talk show on the radio, and they have someone call in that has the radio turned up in the background, you can hear: 1)the host in real time, 2)the caller in real time.  Yet you hear the host on the radio in the background, and it is behind.  Yet it is the same broadcast that you are listening to.  I was listening to a talk show last night when I was trying to go to sleep, and that happened.  I'm too tired to figure it out on my own.
I worked for a radio station for awhile, and when we had callers, we'd put them on a five-second delay, so there was time to cut them off if they started getting obscene.  We always told people to turn down their radio when they called in, to avoid this echo effect, which is distracting.  \n\nThe radio you hear in the background is the back end of the loop.  But what you hear in the foreground is already five seconds delayed from ""real time.""  You can test that by calling in yourself.  But if you leave your radio on when you call, turn it down low enough that they can't hear it in the studio.  It's only polite."
"I have high blood pressure.  Will drinking wine help reduce my blood pressure?

Yes, it can. Drinking one glass of red wine a day is good for you. \nBut really you should eat oatmeal everyday and cut out any processed meats and foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. Exercise also works. \nYou can also take diuretics like Diurex at walmart. But always talk to your doctor before changing your diet or taking any type of supplements while on any prescribed medicines. These lifestyle suggestions I have given could alter your blood pressure and make your current medication to strong for you, causing you to be hypotensive instead."

"Are men really insecure because they are obviously inferior to women and there ability to create!?

Men have low emotional quotiont compared to their women counterparts.Men therefore are puzzled,become irritable and or resume to emotional shut down when it comes to confronting any emotional sensitive situation.Men cant handle crying women.This emotional low quotiont makes them vulnerable in any home,family or love affair.They therefore wonder how women are smart and capable in these directions.How women can be happier than men with love alone.The power which men possess,the ego they harbour,the possessions they gather and the country they rule,everything seems worthless when caught in emotional trauma.This is the reason a man wants to be loved by his mother and wife and be taken care of,though he may not like to admit.Here it is emotional protection.Love is what a woman teaches a man."
"can a child's blood group be O+ if his father has A+ & mother has A- blood group?

YES. Absolutely, despite all the answers you've received to the contrary. \n\nThe way blood groups are named, either your blood contains certain proteins (named A and B) or it doesn't - if you have both you are blood type AB; if you have only A you are A; if you have only B you are, you guessed it, B, and if you have neither you are blood type O.\n\nIf you have a gene for a blood protein, either A or B, you will have that protein in your blood. However, we have two copies of each chromosome, and it is possible that each parent has one copy of the A gene on one chromosome, and doesn't have it on their other chromosome (O). This means they will both be blood type A, since they each have one copy. However, if they have a child who happens to get the O chromosome from each of them, then the child will be blood type O. Mathematically expressed, each parent is AO, and on average their children have a 25% chance of being AA (blood type A and cannot have type O kids), 50% chance of being AO (blood type A but able to have type O kids), and 25% chance of being OO (blood type O).\n\nThis is the whole idea of recessive genes, which also explains why two brown-eyed people can have a blue-eyed baby without any hanky-panky going on.\n\nAs regards the Rhesus factor, i.e. the ""+"", again that is a recessive characteristic. The child must have received the Rh factor from his father, since his mother is negative. (NOTE that any Rh-negative woman who has an Rh-positive baby should get a shot of something called RhoGam, or WinRho, to prevent problems in future pregnancies.)"

"what do they do?
when they do i pap smear i am 26 and i am sceared to go get one and i havent had sex
When you get a pap smear the DR takes a sample of your cirvex tissue with a cotton swab.  Much like the test for streap throat.  It's just not that easy though.  It can be uncomfortable, even if you have had children.  It is nothing to fear, and is quite a wonderful thing to dectect early problems like cancers.  my 19 yr old daughter has had problems with her cycle and has not had sex either.  The Dr. put her on the pill and told her not to worry about the pap smear until she was active or 25.  My personal thought....If your planning sex in the near future or have a family history of female issues,go to the Dr, if not take your time. Talk to your family Dr.  Most Dr's will understand and talk you thru that process.  Good Luck"

"if my car is currently paid off will i be able to refiance it?

A refinance is a re-writing of a loan you have, most generally your home.  If your car is paid off, you have nothing to refinance since you owe nothing.  However, if your question is because you want to see about getting money from it, then what you will probably want to try is securing a loan using your paid off car as collateral.  A bank may give you a loan this way especially if you have some bad credit.  Down fall to that is if you default on the loan, they can take your car and also you may be able to only get a loan for as much as your car is worth."

"how can methane be used as a fuel?
If methane is a gas can it be used as bio-gas?Please do not give a wrong answer.
Burn it like you burn any other hydrocarbon.  All hydrocarbons are just compounds that fit the formula\n\nCnH(n+2)\n\nFor n=1, it's methane.  n=3 is propane (used for barbeques, mobile homes as a fule source, or for camping stoves).  n=4 is butane, used in cigarette lighters.  n=8 is octane, which is a major component of gasoline.\n\nMethane is commonly called natural gas, and is piped into houses for gas stoves and furnaces (at least it is here where I live).  Hydrocarbons combust with O2 to give carbon dioxide and water vapor.\n\nMethane could be developed by organisms in bioreactors, but since there are also great stores of it in the ground from decayed matter (methane is a fossil fuel and a constituent of oil, and often found near coal deposits) generally we mine it rather than making it because it's cheaper that way.  perhaps if all the methane in the ground were used up, it would become cost effective to produce it rather than just mine it."

In support of the country's target to become a global Halal hub and realising the immense potential presented in the robust growth of the industry, MISC Integrated Logistics Sdn Bhd (MILS) is offering a world standard Halal Logistics management solutions.\n\nMILS, a subsidiary of MISC Bhd, is a one-stop logistics provider that integrates all forms of logistics services, be it by land, sea or air.\n\nThe state-of-the-art Regional Logistics Hub (RLH) will be located at Pulau Indah, Selangor, MILS said in a statement here Wednesday.\n\nThere will be a specialised Halal cold chain and chill storage centre in addition to the 24,000 square metres of the Phase One facility which is expected to be completed and operational by early 2007, it said.\n\nIts Free Commercial Zone status and close proximity to Westport, one of Asia's emerging ports, has placed MILS in a strategic position to better attract and benefit Halal producers.\n\nBy leveraging on MILS' logistics expertise, Halal producers are not only guaranteed that their products would be untainted, they could also optimise on MILS' entire supply chain.\n\nThe statement said producers stand to gain through lowering of their operating cost, reduction of lead times as well as speedier distribution of products to the consumers.\n\nWorld Halal Forum Chairman, Khairy Jamaluddin in his visit to MILS said: ""The fact that MILS has supported the World Halal Forum as a silver sponsor underlines their commitment to the development of the Halal industry in Malaysia and to take a leading role in Halal logistics within the global Halal market.""\n\n""Halal logistics and the security of the Halal supply chain will be vital and there is no company better suited for this than MILS,"" he said.\n\nKhairy said it was Malaysia's linkages within the global economy that makes it an attractive business destination.\n\n""MILS could play a major role in that connectivity and would be a key resource centre for Halal manufacturers in this region and can act as a catalyst for further growth in Malaysia's Halal industry,"" Khairy said.\n\nThe renewed focus justifies the emerging trend within the Halal industry, with global Halal food demand chalking a staggering US$570 billion in 2005.\n\nThe World Halal Forum, organised by KasehDia Sdn Bhd, will be held from May 8-10, 2006.\n\nThe forum will be one of the world's most significant meetings on Halal business, where global business leaders and some 500 participants are expected to shape the way Halal is being analysed, applied and appreciated within the global business arena."
"If God is perfect, then He must be in a constant state, which would eventually get boring, which would mean He
isn't perfect anymore.  And why does He say there's no other Gods when he has a father (El I think his name was), mother, sister and two brothers?
Not necessarily.\n\nFrom a purely philisophical point of view, we need to consider the transcendance of time that omnipotence necessarily includes. Therefore our base conceptions of how a constant state is defined are obviated. Very little headway can be made by hypothesizing what the hyperdimensional state of perfection would embody.\n\nAddressing your second question, it is also not reasonable to assume a seperation of entities amoung such a hypothetical divine family. From a mathematical (in particular set theory) point of view, all divine incarnations could conceivably be contained in the 'God' set which could deride any paradox there.\n_________________________________________\n\nTrivially, we could just define God as the union of all godsets. (okay, so this language is getting pretty weird) Perhaps the act of slaying 'bad brother godset' for ""raping"" the 'sister godset' is what allowed 'good brother godset' to combine like Voltron to form the 'unified godset' or whatever. The point is that when you are hypothesizing about the divine state you can't rule out the superconnectedness of all divinity, let alone the many other possible paradigms including the time-honored favorite God/Devil duality.\n\nAlso, I don't think it is just me making up the idea that an omnipotent being might transcend our concepts of time. Certianly it is common to imagine God knowing all that is, was, and ever will be. I don't know about you, but I know that if I were omnipotent I sure wouldn't operate on 'human time'."

"Thermal Energy Problem-Physics?
A 19.6 kg child descends a slide 3.80 m high and reaches the bottom with a speed of 2.52 m/s. How much thermal energy due to friction was generated in this process?\n\nWhat formulas are used for this? How would you solve this problem?
In most physics homework problems, energy is conserved, and the following is true:\n\nEo = Ef\n\nHowever, in this problem, energy is lost due to friction.  Therefore...:\n\nEo - Q = Ef\n\nWe know that the child had potential energy at the top, and kinetic energy at the bottom.  Use this information to calculate the energy lost due to friction.  The energy lost due to friction will be denoted ""Q"" (Q usually stands for heat, which IS thermal energy):\n\nEo - Q = Ef\n\nRearrange the expression, since we're solving for F:\n\nQ = Eo - Ef\n\nNow plug in the formulas for potential and kinetic energy:\n\nQ = mgh - (1/2)mv²\n\nYou don't have to do this, but I factored out the ""m"" (mass):\n\nQ = m[gh - (1/2)v²]\n\nYou can plug things in now, since the values are all given:\n\nQ = 19.6[(9.80)(3.80) - (1/2)(2.52)²]\n\nQ = 668 J"

"How advanced are ant brains?
How do Ant brains compare to modern computational power? Could we synthesise one electronically? Would this be sentient? Are Ants sentient in the first place?
Ant brains are largest amongst insects.  Mushroom shaped brain appendages have function similar to the gray-matter of human brains.\n \nIt has been estimated that an ant's brain may have the same processing power as a Macintosh II computer.\n\nProbably not sentient in the way that we are. They cooperate with each other and have acute senses."

"What is the percentage of women in the US that have a miscarriage in their first trimester of pregnancy?

No one really knows the answer to this question, because doctors now believe that there are many more miscarriages than previously suspected, that take place early in the first trimester. And at that time, the symptoms of miscarriage are not severe, the foetus is so small it can be overlooked in what appears to be simply a heavy menstrual period coming after a missed period. \nSo there are no exact figures, except that it is not uncommon."
"if there was a hole throught the earth.. and someone fell in.. would the hover in the middle? (gravity)?

That's an interesting qts. I assume that you wish to invlove pure physics in this qts. Forget all the heat at the core of the earth and also air resistance.\nConsider pure gravitation theory.\n\nIf say the fellow who fell in the hole has mass m\n\nThen force of gravity exerted by the earth is :\n\n  F = GMm/(r*r) ..... Where G - universal gravitation constant\n\n                            M - Mass of the earth\n                            r - distance between earth and body of mass m\n\n          acceleration due to gravity\n            = (1-h/R)g   .... where h is distance of body beneath the earth's surface and g is acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth.\n\nSo as the body comes closer to the core of the earth, h tends to R.\nSo the acceleration of the body goes on decreasing very much. So, body may not actually hover, since his velocity will be constant the instant it is at the core."
"Is there an exercise taht targets weiht loss to your thighs?

You can not target weight loss. You can target toning. However, by targeting only parts of your body that you find ""fat"", you may start to build muscle under the fat and actually make those parts of your body seem larger! Work out your whole body, do aerobic exercise, and watch your diet."

"Were the apostles more like Judas than everyone would like to think??
Did the apostles ""hijack"" the memory and teachings of Jesus to create a alternative to the Jewish religion and political heirarchy??
It's not a weird notion.  There is no evidence of a lot of things that transpired during the times of Christ.   Sure the Bible talks about it and is the ONLY accepted history of that time.   I'm inclined to think that the apostles did run with their interpretation of Christ's teachings.   I'm not so sure it was to create an alternate Jewish religion, but an alternate politically correct on of the time.   Jesus didn't come to Earth to have people worship him as God.  That was furthest from his teachings.  His teachings were to show people the way to the Father through his teachings.  Even the perverstion of ""The only way to heaven is through Christ.""   It simply means that to get to heaven is to be like Christ and follow his teachings.   It does not mean to worship him as God.   Never has, never did, never will."
"The Exclusive...............?

Are you shocked and how so? Discuss
Hindus do not proselytise. And They are regularly being killed or forced to convert even in India. So called minorities as soon as get enough number start in ethnic cleansing here. It is not a surprise that Hindus are declining. \n\nIndia has been sustaining  Islamic onslaught since 800 AD and christian since 15 th century. It is still surviving and that is more important."

"Hepatitis B Question?

Hepatitis B: A Brief History:\n\nIn 1965, Dr. Blumberg who was studying haemophilia, found an antibody in two patients which reacted against an antigen from an Australian Aborigine. Later the antigen was found in patients with serum type hepatitis and was initially designated ""Australian Antigen"". Subsequent study has shown the Australia Antigen to be the hepatitis B surface antigen. Dr. Blumberg was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Initially there appeared to be three particles associated with hepatitis B infection: a large ""complete"" particle called the ""Dane particle"", a small circular 20nm particle and an oblong 40nm particle. Further research identified the Dane particle as the hepatitis B viron and the other two particles as excess surface protein. This former terminology is no longer used and the virus is referred to according to its structure."

"how do they know???
how do blind people know where the little bumpy/braille writing is?like on waterfountains or on signs near the walls/doors. hopefully i am making sense. answer if you know please : ]
Good question, PL - I think Blunt, Jes, Army and  Multi   are all right. I used to live near a blind musician. If I was nearby I would stay and talk with him until his ride came. For walking and direction, his cane for the blind would be constantly in motion. Other times, he would ask what the noise was coming from the left. He told me several times that all his other senses were heightened when he lost his sight, and the signs in the elevator in Braille, or at an ATM or on the directory of a building were consistently placed. When a building was in the planning stages, the project director would be approached by a group of ""physically challenged"" people - a blind person, a quadriplegic, someone with multiple sclerosis, etc. - and they would suggest placement that would respond to the anticipated needs of other challenged people. Excellent question."
"what is the nurtition content of almonds?

Almonds have 40% of the USRDA of Vitamin E, 20% of Vitamin B2, and 20% dietary fiber. Almonds are high in monounsaturated fats (the ""good"" kind) and are known to help lower cholesterol.\n\nMany of the articles I've found suggest eating mixed nuts to get the advantages of each!\n\n""Almonds have slightly more vitamin E than walnuts, and much more magnesium. Walnuts, stand out as the only nut with an appreciable amount of alpha-linolenic acid, the only type of omega-3 fat you’ll find in a plant-based food. Peanuts (which technically are legumes) lead in the folate category. Cashews have even more magnesium than almonds (83 milligrams per ounce vs. 73) but they lag behind in vitamin E. If it’s selenium you’re after — as many men are, because the mineral might protect against prostate cancer — then look to Brazil nuts: One ounce has almost 10 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 55 micrograms"""

"Arthrogryposis has any one ever heard of it???

What is it? \nArthrogryposis translated from the Greek literally means ""curved or hooked joints."" Hence, this term is used to describe multiple joint contractures present at birth. There are many causes for congenital multiple joint contractures, and could be due to abnormal nerve or muscle development in the womb. However, the commonest form of arthrogryposis, present in 40% of cases, is a condition called amyoplasia. \n\nWhat causes it? \n\nThe cause of arthrogryposis is varied, and not entirely understood. Certainly, in many cases, abnormal nerve, muscle and connective tissue development is involved. Lack of movement of intrauterine movement is also responsible, as in oligohydramnios. Genetic factors do play a part in many cases, as do environmental factors like drugs. Incidence of arthrogryposis is one in 3,000 live births. \n\nWhat are the symptoms? \n\nThe child is born with multiple joint contractures in all limbs. In the commonest form of arthrogryposis, called amyoplasia, the typical deformities are often severe and symmetrical, as follows: \n\nshoulder -- internal rotation deformity \nelbow -- extension and pronation deformity \nwrist -- volar and ulnar deformity \nhand -- fingers in fixed flexion, and thumb-in-palm deformity \nhip -- flexed, abducted and externally rotated, often dislocated \nknee -- flexion deformity \nfoot -- clubfoot deformity \n\nIn the typical child with amyoplasia, intelligence is normal, and sensation is intact. \n\nWhat does your doctor do about it? \n\nTreatment of arthrogryposis is a challenging problem. It should not be undertaken by any one doctor, but by a multi-disciplinary team, including the pediatrician, neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, geneticist, physical and occupational therapist. The aim of treatment is to improve function, not cosmesis. Therapy and bracing is always attempted prior to any consideration of surgical correction. \n\nWhat is the prognosis? \n\nIn a child with normal intelligence, with appropriate treatment, independent ambulation and function can be expected."
"Is reality in fact just an illusion created by our perception?

Yes.  Example, several people can observe the same incident and each will come away with a slightly different perception of what happened.  Go a little deeper - what you believe will also shape your reality.  Some folks look at a tree and believe there must be a god.  Others will simply marvel at the mystery of life.  \n\nReality is truly different things to different people.  Who really knows what reality is?  Doesn't seem to matter, each of us deals with our own reality the best we can.  For some folks, reality is so different from the mainstream that they are unable to function in society.\n\nHope this helps answer yuor question...."
"I know this doesn't make sense but...?
I did something that really bothered and hurt someone that I know. I feel really bad, but I can't apologize to him. I've prayed and asked for forgiveness, but I keep saying (to myself) ""I wish that he (the guy I'm talking about) would just rape me so that I wouldn't feel bad about what I did."" I know that's not something anyone would want to happen, but should I still watch what I say and choose some other way to feel better? I know this doesn't make sense, but if I told you the whole story, it would, kinda.
OK lets try and unravel this into its core components.\n\nA police officer [I am assuming] has told you that you cannot approach and/or speak to this person.\n\nYou however, feeling guilty over whatever it is that you have done, feel an overwhelming desire to be punished for your transgression.\n\nThis is a normal reaction for many people as they feel the psychological need for punishment as this provides a sense of ""closure"" and a shift in guilt.\n\nIn your case you actually want him to do something wrong as well, not just punish you, as this means that he cannot point the finger at you because he has done a horrible thing too.\n\nI know people will say..go to your brother first before coming to the temple...but that does not apply to you in this situation.  You harbour no ill will towards this person!  You cry out to God because your sin is before you.  \n\nGod always hears this cry and you need to focus on your relationship with God first.  This is the path to forgiveness for you, not the friend.  You need to understand that God forgives you.  Then, you may be able to forgive yourself.  Finally you may be able to approach this person and ask forgiveness.\n\nRemember, they may not want to forgive you, and that is their right.  Your peace and forgiveness with God is not dependant upon this persons responses to you, even though you did the wrong thing.\n\nGod may be workingnin that persons life too, and Gods timing is not always ours.  Also, some people just need lots of time to be able to forgive, and just because you may be in a hurry to receive it, does not mean you should hurry them up.\n\nThats why it starts with God for you, so that if this man cannot forgive you, you have peace with God that you did all you could to ask for it....and who knows, in time that might help this man to forgive you anyway.\n\nForgiveness is something you ask for from another because it gives THEM the opportunity to heal from the hurt you have done to them.....\n\nIt is never asked for to make YOU feel better about the pain and guilt that you feel for having caused it.\n\nIn your case, you cant approach this person anyway, so this is a perfect opportunity to seek a counsellor perhaps to give you some support with your feelings and how to deal with them."
"Have any good tips for writing poems?
I NEED SOME ADVICE AND TIP FOR WRITING POEMS SICE IM 13 AND BECOMING A POET ONE DAY.
Yep.  Read more poems.  Frost, Burns, Shelley, others.  Your style may somewhat resemble one, maybe even Poe.  \n\nPoems have emotional content and feeling when they are most memorable, so don't overlook the opportunity when situations provoke similar feelings in you.\n\nYou need a greased track of words though, something that comes with exercise of your language talents.  You will need to become a buddy of dictionaries and thesauri.\n\nTry things like describing the current weather so well that any reader instantly sees what you are seeing.\n\nSimilar exercises are possible, your dog, an unusual friend.\n\nPoems pop out kind of magically sometimes if you are a person affording them such an opportunity.\n\nLook also at the words of songs and hymns.\n\nDo your own rewrites of some of these.  Wonderful new stanzas and poems have come that way."

"Anyone have any good ground rules for renting to a friend that has kids?
My husband and I will own the home and she will live with us and pay rent.She has 3 kids and will use 2 bedrooms.What should the upfront rules be and how to handle any issues as they come up?
You're very brave.\n\nI have three tenants and the only time that I had kids staying with me, their parents were the hassle.\n\nFor all tenants\n\nSpecify what's included in the rent. \nEmergency numbers must be available\nYour guests - is your tenant and children invited to any function you have, or is it going to be on an event basis\nIf your tenant has guests what are the rules  \nIf your tenant has cash flow problems increase the rent to cover a meal a day, otherwise food can be an issue.\nMarking food in need so that it isn't eaten by someone else.\nBreakage and spoilage rules.\nRules of communal areas you will share. \nCleaning up rules and sharing stuff - the lousy tenants I had threw away cutlery rather than wash it.\nPrivacy - if a door is closed knock before entering\nShared bathrooms rules and standards - no videocams\nIf there are pets how must they be treated.\n\n\nFor the kids\nDiscipline issues - make sure that all the adults agree on the kids limits. All kids try and push the boundries. The deal won't work unless the adults unite against the kids. Any discussions about the raising of the children and any rule changes must happen way from the kids. When the adults have agreed on any deal then all three adults must tell the kids the changed rule.    \nWhat are acceptable punishments and who will apply them. Can you or your husband send a kid to their room until their mother comes home? \n\n\nGeneral points\nTalk often and always. Be lenient and flexible but when you aren't impressed let everyone know it. Apologise if you have done something wrong. Stress politeness, get into the habit of greeting and letting everyone know where you are going. Praise and thank when something is done according to the rules. If someone is grumpy or sulking find out why and have it out. If possible have a daily adult talk session in the first week and then reduce it to once a week or once a month, just to iron out friction.  \n\nIt's a big adaptation for some people to share. I find that mature adults can live together profitably. It is laziness, taking advantage, dishonesty and manipulation that causes hassles."

Commercial processing of seeds is designed to ensure maximal germination, not to stop them germinating.\n\n\nThe simple fact is that not all seeds are viable, just as not all pregnacies result in children.\n\n\nFor various reasons seeds can fail. Sometimes that is because of genetic flaws within the seeds. Sometimes the seeds get infected with diseases or mites that eat them before they germinate.\n\n\nMostly seeds fail simply because theye weren't treated right. Sometimes the seeds are too old and have died. Sometimes they are buried too deep, or have been watered too much, or not watered enough, or let get to hot, or too cold or a million other environmental factors that prevent germination."

MASTURBATION MYTHS:\nfrom http://www.jackinworld.com/library/myths.html\n\nChances are, of all the things you've heard about masturbation, most of them were absolutely false. For some reason, misinformation surrounds masturbation like virtually no other topic. How do you spot a masturbation myth? One simple method is to ask yourself if the statement is also true of sexual intercourse. When you're masturbating, your body only knows it's getting sexually stimulated; it doesn't know by what means. So, for instance, if the question is whether or not masturbation causes acne, think of it this way: If it did, intercourse would also cause acne. In fact, neither masturbation nor intercourse cause acne.\n\nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair to grow on your palms.\nFACT:\nHow many people with hair on their palms have you seen?  \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair loss, chronic fatigue, and other problems.\nFACT:\nInternet scam artists have tried to invent a concept called ""overmasturbation,"" insisting that you have to buy their expensive herbal pills in order to counteract the effect of masturbating more than a couple of times per week. But the pills have absolutely no effect — and masturbating once or twice a day will not make your hair fall out, or cause anything else they claim.\nMYTH:\nMasturbation is bad for your eyesight. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not affect eyesight. This myth probably originated because boys often start having to wear glasses at about the same age they start masturbating. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your penis to stop growing (or) to get bigger. \nFACT:\nMasturbation has no effect on penis size whatsoever. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your testicles to shrink.\nFACT:\nAbsolutely false! It is true that if you're highly aroused, your testicles become engorged with blood and may appear slightly larger and heavier, and that masturbating will make them revert to normal. But they will absolutely not be any smaller than after the last time you masturbated. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes acne. \nFACT:\nIt doesn't cause acne. Like the eyesight myth, this is a case of two things that happen at the same time, even though one doesn't cause the other. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes sexually transmitted diseases. \nFACT:\nHello? ""Sexually transmitted"" means from one person to another. You can't give yourself a sexually transmitted disease! \nMYTH:\nIf you masturbate too much, you'll run out of semen and become sterile. \nFACT:\nSemen is a fully renewable resource. When you ejaculate semen, your body simply makes more — the same way your body makes more saliva after you spit. \nMYTH:\nPeople can tell whether you masturbate by how your penis looks. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not change the appearance of your penis. (It does tend to cause an erection, but that usually goes away when you're finished.) \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConnection between ejaculation frequency and prostate health \nhttp://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/4961.html\n\nQUESTION:\nI have been coming across articles on the connection between masturbation, ejaculation, and overall health. I was very surprised about this article from the Cancer Council Victoria in Australia . It was a study that confirmed that ejaculation frequency is important for a healthy prostate. The protective effect was most significant in men in their twenties who ejaculated on average 7 or more times per week. It compared this against same-age men who ejaculated less than 3 times per week. I made a New Year's resolution to pay attention to my body and to ejaculate at least once a day. I feel much better for it and my penis strength and sexual urge has increased immensely. I feel balanced. After a year, I can't imagine going back to my old repressed frequency and probably couldn?t keep from cumming for a whole day if I tried now. Why aren?t people made aware of this need?

"if you're in grade 8 and you're only 5 feet, is that too short or okay? im shorter than every1  read details.?
i'm the second-shortest in my class and i want to get taller!! and nothing seems to fit on me just right. am i going to stay this height forever?!?! wat are some ideas for getting taller???? ive been around 5 ft for like almost a year without growing much
The first and most important thing here is: don't worry.  You're going to end up being who you are--short or otherwise.  There's nothing you can do about it, so just try and accept it.\n\nNext, you may yet experience a ""growth spurt"", a period in your development when you can see your height increase substantially.\n\nI've heard many young women talk about how much they changed physically from their teen years.  It's a possibility for you too, I would guess."
"do u beleive in church?
My family is very religous except me. I beleive in god and any kind of divin higher power. I dont beleive in the church almost everyday my family and people that know my family are always cramming this crap that i'm going to hell cause i dont go to church..the problem is i have always been uncomfortable in church they even had me thinking i had the devil in me when i was younger cause i was uncomfortable. i will never forget it, i was about 11 and just cause i was uncomfortable the ministers wife put her hand on my head and started screaming in my ear for some devil thing or something to get out. so anyways that was off the subject i dont beleive in church just cause theres so much curruption in it..all the molistations and stealling why should any one? and i just find it to hard to beleive that unless your christian your going to hell. i do beleive in god i just dont beleive in the word of man. why do people say your going to hell, i thought only god can judge me not them.
""why do people say your going to hell, i thought only god can judge me not them.""\nYou are absolutely correct: only God can judge people!\n*He he he!* The next time you feel you're being judged unfairly, say this: ""The lot by which you measure will be measured out to you."" (It means that God will judge you the way you have judged others.) If they ask you where it is in the Bible, just say something like, ""You ought to know since you're SO much BETTER than I am!"" (with sarcasm!)\nA lot of people don't like church. Doesn't make them (or you) bad.\nPray about it. It really does help."

"are red lips (in a straight male) a symptom of drug use?
my teenage son is giving me concern
Couple things here:\n\n1st - are the red lips a new change in his appearance?  were they red before?   Typically red lips indicate only that more oxygenated blood is going through them.  Better than blue lips in this case.\n\n2nd - if you are concerned about drug use - consider behavior changes, is school performance changed, are there new unexplained periods of time from home,  and think about how he might be paying for drugs.  Are you missing cash.  Is his own income affected.  These are better signs of substance abuse.  Pupil size and coordination are another good sign.  Really large pupils often indicate substances like speed and coke.  Do his dirty clothes that are sent to be washed smell like smoke or pot?  Both are hard to hide scent wise.\n\n3rd - as uncomfortable as this is... if you don't know if he is doing drugs... how do you know he's straight?  \n\nI would recommend opening a dialog with him.  Open communication and trust between you two will help you not only know what is going on in his life, but also build a base where you can influence his choices in a manner that a teenager responds to more.  Teenagers hate boundaries - but a man to man talk about drugs, what they really are and what they do and why he might choose or not choose to do them may get you farther.\n\nHe may be having other issues, gf problems, bf problems, getting picked on at school, being harrassed by a professor, or have something else on his mind.  Again open communication between you two is going to help him to have someone to talk to about it and you to know what's going on.\n\nBest wishes."
"what is meant by 100% book building offer in respect of public issues by corporate entities?

Whenever a company comes out with an IPO (Initial Public Offering), its valuation is done either internally by the company or most likely by an Investment Bank/ Private Equity, depending on its current revenues, profits, future prospects, management transparency, good corporate governance, etc.\nWith all these parameters and more they come to an approximate value of the company and decide the price band within which the valuation must be fixed, i.e. a lower limit and upper limit is fixed (Example price is between $20-$24)\nWhen potential investors apply for the shares they mention the price that they are willing to pay for the share. This is called 100% BOOK BUILDING, which is the most transparent method of arriving at the valuation of the company. \nIf the shares are over-subscribed, then the shares are allotted to the highest bidders and if any shares remain then to the nest lowest bidder and so on. So as a potential investor I think that if at $20 (Above example), I wont be allotted shares because a lot of people will bid more than me, I will increase my price. However if I think that the high price is unjustified, I will bid at the lower limit."
"If our blood is most like salt water how is it that we evolved to prefer fresh water for drinking?

Even though our blood chemistry is rich in sodium like sea water, we drink fresh water not because of taste but rather biology.  Our bodies need a very fine balance of water content and sodium content.  If the sodium concentration is too low, our cellular functions cease and we die.  If the sodium concentration is too high, our cellular functions cease and we die.  \n\nLand animals lose water through sweat, urine, stool, as well as just by breathing.  We need to replace the water that we lose or else the sodium balance will be tipped and we will die of dehydration.\n\nHuman beings are unable to drink sea water because our kidneys are not efficient enough in concentrating the urine to eliminate the excess salt and in effect will cause the sodium concentration and ultimate kill us.  There are animals that have special adaptations that allow them to survive on salt water, such as more efficient kidneys, glands that secrete the excess salt from their bodies, and better methods to conserve body water... these particular creatures would likely suffer problems if they drank fresh water and die of ""water poisoning"" (i.e. loss of salt.)\n\nIn this case, biology has dictated taste.  You can guess what happened to everyone else who didn't develop the taste for fresh water..."

"How was it determined that the sun is 93,000,000 miles from earth?
To say it is done using the transit of Venus isn't enough.\nwouldn't the distance from earth to Venus be needed?\nHow was that determined?
The *relative* distances between the planets can be determined from Kepler's laws and Newtonian physics. This will give the ratios betwen all the distances in the solar system. Once this is done, only one *absolute* distance needs to be found to get all of the rest. Until fairly recently, absolute distances were determined through parallax. It is possible to watch a transit of Venus from two different locations on earth and get a parallax measurement of the distance to Venus in that way. This gives the actual distance between the earth and Venus, and so the distance from the earth to the sun.\n\nOther methods involved parallax measurements of asteroids that pass close enought to the earth to get good measurements. Now, it is much easier to use radio bounced off of other planets (or probes) and the speed of light to get the required absolute distances."
"who discovered Mercury?
the planet
Mercury has been observed for thousands of years, and the Babylonians are credited with mentioning it in writing for the first time some 3000 years ago.\n\n* Johann Hieronymus Schroeter was the first to observe the planet Mercury and record detailed drawings of Mercury's surface features. Schroeter lived from 1745 to 1816. Unfortunately, his sketches were not very accurate. \n\n* Streaks similar to the so-called ""Martian Canals"" were also seen on Mercury by Schiaparellit and Percival Lowell (1855-1916). \n\n* An astronomer by the name of Eugenios Antoniadi (1870-1944) charted the surface of Mercury in great detail. His maps were used for almost 50 years. He used one of the stronger telescopes of his time and found the canals to be optical illusions. \n\n* Mariner 10 provided a close look at Mercury which redrew earlier telescope charts and maps."
"What is the best medication for depression and why?

I think that is going to vary greatly from person to person. It is usually a case of trial and error, depending on severity and other factors.  A person would first need to talk at length with their doctor in order to give the doctor an idea of which would be best to try first, and even when the right one is found, it might take a little while to get the dosage just right."

"Does every one get lonely?

Yes, generally, everyone goes through periods of loneliness.\nBut, that, simply means that their Life is empty. Or, they are stuck, not knowing what direction to take. What do you want from Life? What are your Goals? What are your Needs? Where do you want to be in the next 5 years as far as relationship, career, education, etc? These are the things which one can deal with during these periods. If loneliness is due to not having anyone in your Life to share with, there are community groups to join and meet people. What are your hobbies or interests? There are groups to join where the people share your specific interests. Loneliness can, also, be related to depression. In that case, check this out with a counselor. One clue is wanting to change one's Life but, not having the energy or ambition to do it. Or, just wanting to ""Shut The World Out."" Those are clues to depression & remedies which can take care of that so, that you an move on in Life. Community Mental Health agencies or local hospital may give you some support. Best of Luck."
"I haven't been to the dentist for a few years, what can i expect?
I haven't been to a dentist for about 15 years, mainly just fear! I had no cavities or work done as a child apart from a little orthodontic work to straighten them up for a bit. I am of an age where flouride was added to the water in the uk, and flouride supplements were given out at school. All my wisdom teeth are present, and only suffered a little soreness when they came through, other than that, I have never had any tooth pain and I brush regularly.\n\nWhat can i expect when I go to the dentist, and being as I have never had pain, is there likely to be anything wrong?
You probably don't have a problem.  My son's teeth are the same way.  A good cleaning and scaling should do the trick!  This is virtually painless.  They will take x-rays to be sure everything is okay.   I go every 6 months to avoid the build-up of plaque on the teeth and floss every day.  You have nothing to fear!!"
"Baslatic magma vs. andesite magma?
Why is the concentraion of water so low in basaltic lava at mid-ocean ridges and the water content much higher in andesite magma at subduction zones? If possible, link the two questions in your answer!
It has to do with the amoungt of silica (SiO2) present in the magma.  Andesitic magma is very viscous, and very explosive, which is a function of the amount of silica.  The greater the percentage of silica, the more viscous the magma is.  With higher levels of silica present, and always high amounts of hydrogen, the possibility to create water under extreme conditions (eruption) has a greater potential with the Andesitic magma because of the greater supply of silica.  The greater supply of silica is linked to subduction zones because a large part of the melt is continental crust which is much higher in silica than oceanic crust.\n\nSo, the concentration of water is low in Basaltic Magma because the concentration of silica is also low.  That is also why Basaltic Lava flows instead of exploding."
"Who leads an orquestra?
the person who leads it?
The Orchestra is lead by the conductor who sets the speed, counts in the players and sets the volume using the baton.\nFor example. Counting 2 bars before the music starts. 1- 2- 3- 4, 2- 2- 3- 4 or if it is a waltz tempo 1-2-3, 2-2-3, Then the music starts with everyone starting at exactly the same time. They move the baton lower if she wants us to play quieter and uses smaller movements. Or bigger and higher movements for louder playing. How fast she moves the baton is how fast to play and if she changes her speed so do you. She uses it to signal for the players to stop. She has the score. It has every ones part on it I believe one after the other with each part on a separate line. I don't know the order but it would be something like this. Clarinet line 1 Saxophone line 2 Trumpet line 3 and so on. \nThey are sometimes called a maestro. They work with all the instruments to make the music sound good providing instruction to specific people or groups.  If there is one the lead or 1st violin is the one they work most closely with."
"Should i be seeing a neurologist?
For the past 2 months i have felt very spacey or a clousyness in my head 24/7.  I have been to many doctors and had many tests done.

Does anyone know if a neurologist would be a good doctor to go for these problems.  I have had a CAT scan, stress test and blood work and it all somes back fine.  The only thing that came back is that I have neck spasms but i know they can't be causing all these problems.  Everyday I feel like shit and i don't know what else to do.

"Who was Damon?

Damon was a 5th century BCE. Pythagorean philosopher of Syracuse. Damon was a close friend to Phintias the Pythagorean. Dionysius, the tyrant, having condemned Phintias to death for conspiring against him, Phintias begged that leave might be allowed him to go for a short period to a neighboring place, in order to arrange some family affairs, and offered to leave one of his friends in the hands of Dionysius as a pledge for his return by an appointed time, and who would be willing, in case Phintias broke his word, to die in his stead. Dionysius, skeptical as to the existence of such friendship, and prompted by curiosity, assented to the arrangement, and Damon took the place of Phintias. The day appointed for the return of Phintias arrived, and the public expectation was highly excited as to the probable issue of this singular affair. The day drew to a close; no Phintias came; and Damon was in the act of being led to execution, when, of a sudden, the absent friend, who had been detained by unforeseen and unavoidable obstacles, presented imself to the eyes of the admiring crowd and saved the life of Damon. Dionysius was so much struck by this instance of true attachment that he pardoned Phintias, and entreated the two to allow him to share their friendship (Val. Max. iv. 7; Plut. De Amic Mult."
"Has anyone had bad side effects with Advair disc inhaler?
I have tried to use it at my allergist's suggestion on 2 different occasions.  After using it 2 xs a day for a couple of weeks I would lose my voice.  I believe the Advair caused it.  Are there any other concerns with Advair?
As with any medication there are side affects and unfortuneately you have a side effect to Advair.  Talk to your doctor about your concerns and see what they have to say.  If they want you to continue to take the Advair but you feel that it may affect your voice let them know that you are not comfortable taking it and ask for other suggestions.  However, make sure that you are rinsing out your mouth and even try gargling with water after taking Advair.  If you don't rinse or not well then you have a good chance of getting thrush(a yeast infection) in your mouth and throat that is very painful and requires lots of antibiotics.  This could also lead to losing your voice.  But if you rinse well and you still have the side effect, then definately talk to your doctor about it and find a different approach."
"would me recently widowed mom have to pay capital gains taxes on the sale of the home she shared with my dad?
house has been lived in by them for 12 years,
If the sell of the home is in the same year of your dad's passing, then up to $500,000 of the gain from the sell would be excluded from your mom's gross income.  If it is the year after, then the exclusion will be up to $250,000 of the gain.\n\nIf the house was part of community property, then one-half of the home would get a step-up in basis to the Fair Market Value of the home on the date of your dad's passing.  So, you might not have that much gain, leaving you well below the exclusion limit.\n\nHope this helps, and I'm sorry to hear about your loss."
"equation of circle inscribed in parabola?
Find the equation of the circle with a radius of 1 inscribed in the parabola y=x^2.\n\n\nHow would I go about solving this?\nThank You
x^2 + (y-5/4)^2 = 1\n\nFirst, the circle must be on the y-axis by symmetry as zanti3 noted.\nSo the equation is in the form x^2 + (y-a)^2 = 1\nTo find the points of intersection with the parabola, y=x^2,\ncombine the equations thusly: \ny + (y-a)^2 = 1\ny + y^2 - 2ay + a^2 = 1\ny^2 + (1-2a)y + (a^2-1) = 0\nor \ny = [2a - 1 ± √(5-4a)] / 2\n\nNow, there is the easy intuitive way to proceed, and the brute force method to proceed.\nThe easy intuitive way is to note that the two values of y represent the intersection points of the circle and parabola.  But by symmetry (and also that the circle is tangent, not twice intersecting for (positive) x), we know that these two y-values must be the same!\nTherefore, \n [2a - 1 + √(5-4a)] / 2 =  [2a - 1 - √(5-4a)] / 2\nor \n√(5-4a) = 0\n5 - 4a = 0\na = 5/4; thus x^2 + (y-5/4)^2 = 1 is the equation!!!\n{(√3/2, 3/4) and (-√3/2, 3/4) are the points of intersection. Note that these points satisfy both equations.}\nFor a graph, see:\nhttp://mudandmuck.com/str2/circle-parabola.JPG\nNote that the circle is indeed ""inscribed"".\n\nOne brute force method is to take the derivitive of both functions, set them equal to each other and then substitute\ny = [2a - 1 ± √(5-4a)] / 2 for y.  You will get the same answer,\nas follows:\n\n(1) 2x + 2yy' - 2ay' = 0\n2x + y'(2y - 2a) = 0\ny' = 2x/(2a - 2y)\nand\n(2) y' = 2x\nso at the intersection points,\n2x = 2x/(2a - 2y)\n2a - 2y = 1\ny = a - 1/2\n\ncombined with:\ny = [2a - 1 ± √(5-4a)] / 2\na - 1/2 = [2a - 1 ± √(5-4a)] / 2\n2a - 1 = 2a - 1 ± √(5-4a)\n± √(5-4a) = 0\n5 - 4a = 0\na = 5/4"

Nattokinase was first described by Sumi et al. in 1987.  It is currently available as part of a proprietary blend in combination with pycnogenol - together they are known as pinokinase or Flite Tabs.  A human study in the journal Angiology in 2003 showed Flite Tabs to be effective in reducing thrombotic events and in controlling edema in high-risk subjects during long airplane flights, but this was a relatively small, and possibly nonblinded study.

"If God is all knowing, doesn't that make him powerless?
We are taught that God is all-powerful, and all-knowing;He knows everything that has happened, that is happening, and (and this is important) everything that will happen. Doesn't this mean that, from God's point of view everything has already happened, and He is, therefore a powerless passenger in a series of events that, for Him, have already occurred ? And, if he is powerless, then He's not omnipotent, and therefore, He's not God. And if he believes he can change things, then He doesn't know everything, and is also, therefore, not God.

"why is it more difficult to ride bicycle on a steep slope compared to walking with da cycle?

The simplest answer is balance.\n\nIt isn't energy - you expend the same whether you're pedalling or walking to achieve the difference in altitude.\n\nHowever, the cadence (rate at which you spin the pedals), and the gearing between your foot speed and the (rear) wheel speed  is a factor in the how fast the wheels move ... and therefore in how good a gyroscope you have. Faster feet (and faster wheel speed) means better balance.\n\nClimbing a hill, you trade off mechanical advantage for foot speed, at the expense of wheel speed. The amount of strength expended to keep the bike upright (by tweaking with your upper body) increases after a certain foot/wheel combination is achieved. Thus it becomes ""harder"" to do.\n\nThe other point of balance has been referred to earlier by another answerer; if the center of gravity (of the system, which includes both the rider and the bike) advances too far forward, there's a loss of balance. The same occurs if it moves too far rearward. At intermediate points, it requires more concentration and percieved effort to keep everything ""rubber side down"" ... thus it appears harder to accomplish some maneuvers on the bike."

Occasionally the charts are correct.  Occasionally they are not. When they are not it is call a whip saw.  I tend to use charts but I do not rely on them completely.

"I'm 16 and my periods have been irregular for almost 3 years. Is this normal?
I work out a lot, eat healthy and drink iron tablets daily.
Yes this can be normal.  It also depends on your height and weight.  Your body was designed to produce another life.  Therefore, if your body senses that your environment is too hostile to bring another life into the world, then periods will become irregular.\n\nYou say that you work out a lot.  If your height and weight are disproportionate (your too thin) then your periods will become irregular or stop altogether as is the case with anorexia nervosa.  The iron tablets are good if your body is low in iron.  Otherwise, you may need to visit your primary care provider or a gynecologist for more answers.\n\nThank you for your question."
"Why do people think that nephesh/psuche can live without a body and think they are ruach/pneuma?
Note: hebrew and greek words.\n\nIf God formed Adam's body out of the dust of the ground, breathed into him the ruach/pnuema of life and Adam became a living nephesh/psuche, then how do you believe the nephesh/psuche lives on after death? The ruach/pneuma is the animating force and nephesh/psuche is the being. If the body is not animated by the ruach/pneuma, the psuche cannot live.
Actually the text in Gen says that ""he breathed into his nostrils the nishmat chaim and he became a living nefesh"".  It doesnt say the ruach of life.  However, I do agree with your point.  The nefesh is in the blood and that returns to the earth when you die but the nishama lives on."
"Just found out my renter smokes, violating her lease. How do I get rid of the smell so I can sell the house?
I heard you have to install new carpet, get rid of the drapes, wash all walls with tsp or base-coat them with kilz, then use regular paint , get rid of the furniture and get air ducts cleaned.I'm sending her a violation of lease notice with 30 days to remedy and want to itemize what she needs. Thanks!
We got a great deal on a house because it was horrible with cigarette smoke.  My huband is a painter and you definately need to kilz or use Sherwin Williams PROBLOCK oil base and an oil based paint as a top coat.  we removed the carpet and replaced it but I am sure you can  get it steam cleaned and get the curtains cleaned, but I would make sure that the dry cleaners knows they need to remove the smoke odor.  If you hire professionals to clean the furniture remind them that they are removing smokers damage. We did not get the air ducts cleaned but you really should, the smell does come through them on occassion. If you are selling the house, maybe remove the furniture and sell it vacant.  if you decide to replace the carpet, let the buyers pick the colors, it's a big help.  Good luck."

"waht is a rainbow?

A rainbow is a section of the circle of light formed by the Sun's rays internally reflecting through the liquid droplets in the air (If you were high enough, you would see the entire halo, instead of a semi-circle). Each raindrop acts as a thin film. The light enters, is bent, partially reflected off the inside back of the drop, then is bent again as it exits back to your eyes. This double bending allows the different speeds of the different frequencies of visible light in water to become apparent, as different frequencies of light refract at different angles. Thus, the double refraction caused by the reflection makes a large enough angle difference between colors for your eyes to finally see the different frequencies present in the sunlight.\nTo see one, the Sun should be behind you, and a sheet of water droplets in front of you. Someone holding a hose and spraying water can make a partial rainbow. \nSee the source for pictures and details."
"can anybody buy direct from mutual funds?

The cheapest and often best way to buy funds is to deal directly with a 100% no-load mutual fund company. If you find a fund that interests you, call the company and ask for a prospectus and application. With true no-loads you pay no sales charges, exit fees or other charges. Load funds can charge from .5 to 9 percent in sales charges plus other charges. These sales charges are deducted directly from your initial investment and subsequent deposits. The Investors Alliance feels that most investors should buy directly from the fund company and purchase no-load funds or low-load (less than 3 percent sales charge) funds. Keep in mind also that if you buy no-load funds through a broker instead of directly by mail, you still must pay a broker's commission."
"What is bleach made out of?
I do not want to make the stuff i just want to know how it is made
To bleach something is to remove or lighten its color; a ""bleach"" is a chemical that can produce these effects, often via oxidization. Common chemical bleaches include sodium hypochlorite, or ""chlorine bleach,"" and ""oxygen bleach,"" which contains hydrogen peroxide or a peroxide-releasing compound such as sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate. ""Bleaching powder"" is calcium hypochlorite. Bleaching may be a preliminary step in the process of dyeing.\n\nHousehold bleach or sodium hypochlorite is used in the home for whitening clothes, removing stains, and disinfecting. This is because sodium hypochlorite yields chlorine radicals—oxidizing agents readily reacting with many substances.\n\nHair bleach contains H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), which gives off oxygen radicals as it decomposes. Oxygen and chlorine radicals both have comparable bleaching effects.\n\nChlorine bleach is often used with laundry detergent and is also commonly used as a disinfectant by homemakers and janitors. Mixing bleach and cleaners containing ammonia, or using bleach to clean up urine can create toxic chloramine gases and an explosive called nitrogen trichloride.\n\nNot all bleaches have to be of oxidizing nature. Sodium dithionite is used as a powerful reducing agent in some bleaching formulas.\n\nChlorine dioxide is used for the bleaching of wood pulp, fats and oils, cellulose, flour, textiles, beeswax, and in a number of other industries.\n\nIn the food industry, some organic peroxides (acetone peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, etc.) and other agents (e.g. bromates) are used as flour bleaching and maturing agents."
"What is leprosy?
NO spam. What is it? Where Can it be found?
When you mention the word Leprosy, most people think of a disease that was only in Jesus' day. We remember the story of how Jesus healed the Lepers, and how they had been banned to live in caves. We thought how horrible, they were depicted as monsters. Can there be such a thing that is so awful? Surely, that was hundreds of years ago. Not necessarily. Is it still around today? The answer is yes! \n\n\nAlthough Leprosy is not common, there are still reported cases today. Leprosy is also called Hansen's disease. There are reported cases in Lousisiana, New York, Hawaii, California, and Texas and Florida, although the people who have it were not born in the United States. \n\n\n \nLeprosy is much less contagious than once believed. It has to be contracted from direct contact or from inhaling the droplets coughed or sneezed by an infected person. Leprosy is caused by a bacteria. \n\n\nSymptoms of Leprosy include: \n\nloss of feeling, numbness \n\nsores on the skin \n\nreduced ability to sweat \n\n\nLeprosy causes multiple gross sores all over the body. They are deep and there is extensive scarring. The nerves are affected and there is nerve damage. It begins with tingling and numbness, then paralysis. Leprosy can invade the skin, the nerves, the bones, the eyeballs, and cartilage. This awful disease leads to blindness and disfigurement, if not treated. \n\n\nLeprosy is treatable to a certain extent. There is no cure for leprosy. There are many medications that can halt leprosy and keep in under control. It may be necessary to take them for a lifetime. Sometimes, in extreme cases, plastic surgery can be done to correct disfigurements and there have been cases of nerve and tendon transplants to restore use of arms and legs."

"is sushi good for pregnant woman?

Some types of sushi, such as California rolls (which contain steamed crab) and cooked eel, are fine to eat while you're pregnant. But it's best to avoid eating the kinds that contain raw seafood, such as tuna. Fresh, raw seafood is potentially risky because it can contain parasites such as tapeworm, which, if they grow large enough, could rob your body of nutrients needed for your growing baby. Freezing and cooking deep-sixes the parasites. For this reason, many Japanese restaurants that specialize in sushi use frozen rather than fresh fish. But restaurants in the United States aren't required to freeze fish before serving it raw.\nAs far as eatting canned tuna and the like at home- According to the latest recommendations, pregnant women can safely eat up to 12 ounces of a variety of fish a week. Canned tuna is one of the most commonly consumed types of fish with low mercury levels according to the FDA. Pregnant and nursing women can safely consume albacore as one of their fish choices. The new advisory tells pregnant women they can safely eat up to six ounces of albacore a week (an average sandwich contains 2 ounces)."
"When did polygamy become illegal in the United States?

It became illegal in the U.S. territories in 1862, probably because people were very upset that the Mormons were practicing this form of marriage.  The LDS church eventually gave up polygamy in 1890, because the US government came down so hard on them. Utah was allowed to become a state in 1896. \nI think that originally this was something outlawed by each individual state, but not the federal government because hardly anyone was interested in doing it. In the 1800's women had an increasingly louder voice in politics, and they no doubt pushed men to outlaw the practice."

"how to detoxify liver ?
i am facing a lot of problems due to heavy toxicity in my body..pls suggest something..also if any natural or chemical medicines are available for this..what general guidelines should i follow?
Detoxifying the liver\nVarious nutrients are required in order for the liver detoxification to be carried out successfully. An adequate supply of key antioxidants is essential to prevent further liver damage. Milk thistle, vitamin C, selenium, beta carotene, vitamin E, and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) are all powerful antioxidants which are helpful in liver detoxification.\n\nThe amino acid SAM-E plays an important role in liver health, in addition to helping with depression. Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts and cabbage in the diet have been shown to enhance liver detoxification. I use those regularly when vegetable juicing.\n\nThe B vitamins, including riboflavin and niacin, also aid in liver detoxification."

"opinions on capital punishment?

In the state of Texas, we execute more people than any other state of the union but even in Texas, the death penalty is hotly debated.  Not all states in the US have the death penalty but those that do have the same issues with it as here in Texas.\n\nLet’s start with a few of them… Firstly, the original reason for the death penalty was it was suppose to be a deterrent for crime.  It’s still touted as such in the states that do have the death penalty.  But, if you look at the statistics in the states that do have it you will see that it is not a deterrent at all.  Crime rates have not drastically dropped since its implementation.  If it were the state of Texas would be the state in the union that has the lowest violent crime rate, it doesn’t.  The only deterrent effect it has is that the person that is put to death will never again break the law.  That doesn’t drop the crime rate or make us any safer.  The realism is most criminals think they will never get caught, that they are too smart.  When criminals are doing whatever they are doing that is going to send them to death row they are not even considering the death penalty while they are performing the crime.  So that throws out the argument of being a deterrent and lowering crime rates.   \n\nSecondly, it was also suppose to lower costs of prisons.  If you execute the criminals they aren’t going to cost as much to feed, house or be taken care of.  Like the crime rate argument, this one is false as well.  In all actuality it takes more money to execute someone then to house them for life.  That has to do with the legal system and the appeals process.  Most of those on death row have court appointed lawyers because they can’t afford to hire one.  So the tax payers of the state end up footing the bill for not only the prosecution and housing the prisoner they end up paying for his legal defense as well.  In Texas, it costs almost three times more to execute someone then it does to house them in the highest security level for life (stats come from www.deathpenaltyinfo.org).  So how is that fulfilling the promise of lower costs?\n\nThirdly, it is considered retribution.  Unlike life imprisonment, where someone can lead a fairly normal life and have some luxuries, the death penalty does not allow that.  For some that are pro-death penalty that is acceptable because it is a true punishment for a crime, not a chance to rehabilitate the criminal.  With varying degrees people do agree with this, citing the ‘eye for an eye’ quote as back up for it.  But others feel that the states don’t have to right to impose retribution on an individual, that as ‘man’ we don’t have that right to take another life.  A lot of the belief systems that argue both for and against this have to do with religious principles.  But should states have that ability and be able to enforce death when they bluntly always say the state is not there to give retribution?  Isn’t death the utmost in retribution rather than punishment?\n\nFourthly, there is recidivism.  That is that some criminals repeat, repeat and repeat crimes no matter how many time they are sent to jail.  This is true.  There is a certain class of criminals that do repeat their crimes over and over, each time getting worse.  There seems to be nothing that can be done with these people that will work to rehabilitate and reform them.  Repeat offenders do seem to dominate the criminal justice system and are a big chunk of those that are incarcerated.  From the people that oppose the death penalty they say that drugs are a large part of this population, that is true, and sometimes it takes many rehabs to work but in the end it will, eventually.  They also say that the three strikes laws (generally this means after 3 felonies the offender is usually put in prison for life or a very extended stay and are unlikely to get out, although each state has it’s own version of this).  Also, for some criminals, life in prison with no p"

"What is a good investment to make with 2,000 Dollars?

The best way to do anything yourself is to learn something about it first. You'd be surprised at the thousands of books available on this one subject at your local library.\n\nBut most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. \n\nAre you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?\n\nIf you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always ""in"" the market.\n\nThey say ""Buy and Hold"" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of ""long term"" is. \n\nThe Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit.\n\nIn my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.\n\nThis is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.\n\nIf you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles.

"What is the death tax and who does it affect?

The 'Death Tax' is a more accurate term for 'Estate tax'.  Technically it is paid by the estate (remaining assets of the deceased).  Those most affected are heirs of small business owners.  The value of the business often causes the estate to owe taxes without providing sufficient cash to pay them.  In this case, the business may have to be sold to pay taxes.\n\nSomeone mentioned the inheritance tax.  This is a separate tax imposed by some states, but not the federal government, on the heirs who inherit the estate."

I'm not a christ so i dunno what is all about?\nDoes Jesus married with Maria or mary Magdalena? who is she? \nDoes Mary Of Bethany, Maria the sinner n' maria magdalena was the same person.\n\nDoes Ocpus Dei really exist?
Here is some facts for you.  Although the book by Dan Brown was fiction there was alot of research behind the events they describe in the bible.  As for the marriage although the bible does not come out and say Jesus married anyone the fact remains the he was a Rabi. To be a Rabi you needed to be married. If he was not married it would have been very odd in that time and alot of people would have wrote about it.  Lets also not forget that the bible is a collection of books that man wrote.  The fact is that there were thousands of people that followed Jesus around and the Roman ruler constantine only chose the books that made Jesus appear to be the son of ""God"".  He had a bunch of other writings burned if they showed Jesus to be more man like.  Also Mary would have not been allowed to follow Jesus around unless she was family with someone that did follow Jesus.  It still is a strict policy today in the middle east.  To top that off the bible says right out, I think it was Matthew that says it....he asks the other people ""Why does Jesus love her (Mary) more than us.  It also states that Jesus kisses Mary unlike any other.  Try this book on for size its not fiction it is historical research.....called ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" very interesting read and it talks about the possible bloodline of Jesus."

"can sum1 explain the religion scientology to me and its customs?

It is a CULT. Despite what a few fanatical members may say, it IS a cult. The church harasses & bullies anyone who they deem an ""enemy"" (basically anyone who has anything negative to say about the ""church""). They will RUIN YOUR LIFE if you speak out against them long enough.\n\nThe founder is L. Ron Hubbard, the science FICTION writer who once told a friend that the best way to make lots of money is to start your own religion. Though being a very outspoken critic of psychiatric drugs, it was discovered upon Hubbards death that the anti-anxiety drug hydroxyzine (Vistaril) was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric & pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. (visit this link to read about the uses of hydoxyzine: http://www.drugs.com/mtm/v/vistaril.html )\n\nScientologists believe the evil alien ruler Xenu killed a lot of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by bringing them to earth & blowing them up inside volcanoes. They believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are ""Body Thetans"") have attached themselves to us & cause many of our mental & physical ills. Members who know about Xenu will attempt to deny it or pretend like it doesn’t matter.  They are required to sign a contract binding them to silence on the matter.  Lower level members don’t know about Xenu & accordingly deny everything because they honestly don’t know.\n\nTo rid ourselves of ""Body Thetans"" & also “engrams” (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind) so that we can become “clear”, we have to go through ""auditing"" with a member of the “church” who uses an ""e-meter"" to measure our “reactive mind”...... & we have to pay lots & lots of money for “auditing” (purchased in 12.5-hour blocks, costing anywhere from $750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions) & to take courses on Scientology to advance to higher “levels” in the “church”. The “church” has also taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional in everyday life. They deny the reality of chemical imbalance & profound mental disturbance & accordingly do NOTHING to effectively stabilize the dangerously unstable. The “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from member (with deadly results).\n\nScientology is undeniably a cult. For more information on what a cult is & what their damaging effects are, please visit the link provided at the bottom of the sources. Just know that Scientology DOES qualify by meeting these 5 criteria:\n\n(1) It uses psychological coercion to recruit, indoctrinate & retain its members. (2) It forms an elitist totalitarian society.

(5) Its wealth does not benefit its members or society."
"Taxes on CD,s?
I have a 5 year CD paying a very low interest. I am thinking of cashing it in and paying the  penalty of about $400. How is this amount handled on my tax return?
You get to deduct the penaltly from your total federal income (I believe line 30 of the 1040).  All states are different so you'll have to check into that. The penalty you need to report on your return should be on the 1099 when you receive it."
"I have a 2nd mortgage I can't pay. Husband died. 1st is current. What will happen?
The loan is in his name with me as co-borrower.  Due to his illness we filed for bkruptcy three years ago before he died.  The loan has been 'sold' or transferred twice since then.  I am receiving a VA pension from his wartime service that barely covers the bills.  I have cleared up most of my financial problems from his long-term illness and am rebuilding my credit with small available balance credit cards.  Can they take my house away even if I am up to date and current on my first mortgage plus taxes and insurance?  Damnit.  Last hurdle...
The holder of the second mortgage could in theory foreclose on your home, even though you're up to date with the first mortgage and the taxes.  It's conceivable that your situation (widow of a veteran) might give you some extra protections, but I think that's a long shot, and you would have to ask an attorney about that.  The suggestion some other folks have made to refinance is certainly worth looking at.  If the interest rate on your first and second mortgages is relatively high, it's possible that by refinancing (that is, getting a new loan to replace both old loans) you could afford the payments on the total amount owed. A call to the first lender or to any mortgage broker could answer that question.\n\nOne other thing to remember is that the second lender probably would like to avoid foreclosing, as it's expensive and time-consuming, and if you don't have much equity in the home, the lender may not get his money back.  So he may have an incentive to negotiate with you--that is, to take a smaller monthly payment or to agree to some other terms that would work for you.  There is no harm in contacting the lender and talking to him."
"Do Sine, Cosine, and Tangent have any specific value?? For instance the number pi have a value approx. 3.14?

Yes, but their values are dynamic, meaning their values changes in respect to the arguments passed to them. (well, you can also say that they don't have values)\n\nsin cos tan is a function, they takes an argument then return a value, they don't have a fixed value, but rather their value is determined by the argumnet given to them. This values is determined by the ratio of the sides of a right angled triangle\n\nPi is a mathematical constant, thus it have a value, i.e. 3.1415...\n\nAnother example of other mathematical function is log (logarithm). Log doesn't have a value\n\nAn example of other mathematical constant is pi and e\n\nTo Popkin: sorry, for the wrong ""dynamic"" mistake, English is not my first language. And dunno, please make an answer of your own, don't just copy others."

"Why are homosexuals so offended by being called queers?
Queer has traditionally meant 'strange' or 'unusual', but is currently often used in reference to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities.
I'm gay and I'm not offended by the word itself. When it is used as a descriptive term for my sexual predisposition I am not bothered by it. When it is used as a derogatory insult then I am bothered, but I also consider that the person using it that way is an uninformed individual who probably has some serious insecurities concerning his/her own sexuality. I feel sorry those people and their sexual partners. \n\nSincerely,\nTerry"
"I need help with a research project?
What are the ways someone can contract HIV?\nHow long does someone live with HIV?\nWhat are some of the stereotypes of people who are infected with HIV?\nWho is at risk for contracting HIV?\nWhat are the risky behaviors?
You contact HIV usually through unprotected sex, sharing needles, or blood transfusions, basically body fluids and open wounds.  Anyone is at risk for it because people who have it might not know at first and be spreading it to others, the stereotypes are usually hookers, gay people, drug users, street people but that's not really true because anyone can get it or be born with it, we just all like to think it won't happen to us.  Risky behaviors are unprotected sex, sharing needles, and open wounds that bleed and anyone else with an open wound touching something can pick up germs.  It depends on the person as to how long they live.  Some believe saliva can spread germs, others don't. I would just be all around careful if I was around someone I knew that could possibly be infected."
"what effect  of ozone  in  water  treatment  when  dosed  in  high  concentration.?

Depends on how you set it up.\n\nThe result will range from a more complete oxidation of waste to ozone saturating water and start to leave water phase.\n\nOzone is a toxic gas, - avoid ozone release.\nTreated waste will qualitatively not be more harmful than for a ""normal"" ozone dosis. The quantities of ketones, aldehydes, acids and carbon dioxides will increase and harmfullness depends on quantity."
"Does God really love me, or even like me?
I cant understand why, if He does love me, i go through so much pain on a daily basis.  And its like im forced to live my life alone.  I have a little speech problem, and for that no one wants to be with me.  I look at that as though He screwed me for life when i was born.  Im the nicest guy you'd ever wanna meet, but it feels as if im cursed.  Its so bad that i wish i were dead.  I dont understand how He can let me go through this when i live right and do eveerything like im supposed to-go to church every Sunday, and still he spits it all back in my face.  Does he love me, or does he like torturing me every day of my life?
He loves you.  He tests his most loved.  Why was prophet Jesus tortured and nailed to a cross and all that?"

"what is quaternary?

With respect to proteins, it is a structural term. Primary structure is the amino acid sequence. Secondary structure is the way amino acids locally shape up (alpha helix, beta sheet). Tertiary structure is how the overall protein unit is shaped (how the loops, turns, helices, sheets, etc. all come together to form the whole protein unit). Quaternary refers to how several separate protein units (sometimes called subunits) come together to form a unique protein. Most large proteins are made up of 2 or more subunits. So the overall shape of these multi-unit proteins is the QUARTERNARY structure."
"Why do people from india sway there head when you talk to them?
head swaying i think is the most anoying thing they do, are the nodding yes or no.....
In India it is consider as a mark of respect to nod when some one is telling you something.It is to acknowledge the speaker.If one does not do anything it means one is not interested in listening to the other person.\nIn case the speaker is an elder or a very respected person there is only nodding and not even a yes, the listner simply gets to work after the conversation is over."
"That picture from space of the comet Temple 1 being hit by the spacecraft Deep Impact.  That kind of looked?
like a nuclear detonation. Is NASA testing weapons in space?
The image depicts the first moments after Deep Impact's probe interfaced with comet Tempel 1. The illuminated -- and possibly incandescent -- debris is expanding from the impact site. The rough-hewn edges at the top and bottom of the flash are a result of light given off at impact saturating some of the pixels in the camera's imager. The pixels ""bleed"" excess electronic charge onto adjacent pixels in the same column. \n\nProbably not testing weapons, at least no in this scenario."
"What makes Glass break?
in idiot terms PLEASE!
On a recent camping trip, we put an empty glass bottle into the fire to try to melt it.  It half melted into an interesting shape.  We fished it out and allowed it to cool.  After it had completely cooled it had micro cracks all over it.  The next day, with no outside influence, the bottle broke from the internal stresses that it got in the fire.  Glass is an amorphous material.  It is actually a supercooled liquid.  A plate glass window will get a wider thickness on the bottom and a thinner thickness on the top.  It takes a very long time for the thickness to be noticeable.  but it will eventually flow down into a puddle.  This will take about 200,000 years.\n\nGlass, basically, is very brittle.  Brittle materials break easily."
"Food labels??? English and Spanish info . . .Do you think that???
this is to 'teach' the North American the Spanish language?\nOR\nto 'teach' the South American the English language?\nPerhaps French will appear also, soon?
a-mazed, \n\nHere is my take. Anyone who is multi-lingual is also likely to be a more rounded, more tolerant, person. So the Spanish I pick up from reading food packages helps me in many ways.\n\nI know that Canadian packaging includes French and English. Most electronic instruction manuals have several languages. I like that, as simply seeing that other cultures exist helps me with my tendency to think of my way as superior - which is not reality.\n\nAll of this is written by a guy who flunked Latin in the seventh grade and learned only a dozen or so Spanish words during 27 years of intense exposure to the Spanish culture - but thanks for the opportunity to vent, and for 2 points.\n\nSo, IMHO, the bi-lingual food labels ""teach tolerance"" to those who object, and ""teach language"" to everyone -  we have the Rosetta Stone on a soup can!"
"Which brand of telescope is the best?
Hello,\nI'm a beginner at using a telescope and I'm planning on buying one within the next week.  I want to find something fairly cheap (about $100.00 to $200.00).  I plan on using it a lot so I don't want something too cheap, something that will be good for looking at planets.  Also, when choosing a telescope I know I have to think about where I will be using it, I will be using it in an suburban area with moderat light and pollution.  Please let me know what you think would be a great telescope for me.  Thanks!
Sky and Telescope reviewed under $200 telescopes in the December '05 edition, and their well-rated telescopes (in order of preference) were:\nOrion SkyQuest XT4.5 Dobsonian\nOrion StarBlast Astro Telescope\nOrion SpaceProbe 3 Altazimuth\nOrion Observer 70mm Altazimuth Refractor\nScientifics Astroscan\n\nThe two at the top of the list have the largest apertures, at 4.5"", and will therefore show you more than the others. The next two on the list are smaller, and the Astroscan won't take enough magnification for planets.\n\nDon't listen to people who will try to tell you that a small telescope is better for light polluted skies - bigger is ALWAYS better.\n\nStay away from Walmart and other discount stores, sporting goods stores,  science stores, camera stores, and eBay.

"How to complete the message of life if a person dies sooner than expected?

What does it mean to die sooner than expected?  Fact is, our time on Earth is predestined from the time of our birth.  Thus, there's no such thing as dying 'sooner' than expected.\n\nIf a message is interrupted, then it wasn't meant to be delivered by the deceased.  If the message is meant to be continued, it may do so through another vehicle.\n\nAnd God only knows best."

"Why are some people gay?
I think it is because they are all emtionally distressed. What do you think?
God gives us human desires but we are told to keep them in check.  We may have a desire to have multiple partners but we are warned against that.

But we are warned agaisnt acting on those desires.  \n\nSo it doesnt really matter to me whether they were born that way are not, they should not act on those desires.

If it was never rolled over or withdrawn, normally all you need to do is contact the HR department at the company.  They will give you information about what's in the account now, including his account number, and then you just need to decide who you want to roll it over to.  I'd recommend rolling it into an IRA but if he has another 401k at his new work, he also has the option of rolling it into that account.\n\nI have to admit that I'm a little worried that he hasn't gotten any statements or anything over this time.  Even with the company shut down, the 401k should still be in existence.  Did your husband keep his address updated?\n\nI'd suggest trying to reach someone else who worked in the company with him to determine who is administering the 401k plan, and then contact them.  Surely he can remember the name of someone who he worked with, and find them in the Asheville phone book.\n\nBest of luck."
"For Medical people: Do you believe in miraculous healing? Have you experienced/seen one?
Have you experienced/ seen someone who's been miraculously healed? What do you think about it? Do you believe in God?
I believe that it exists though I cannot say I have seen or experienced one myself.\n\nI would have to say though, that I believe that such miracles are generally NOT associated with people who are literally on their death beds with their doctors saying they will die very shortly.  They generally are not associated with people who are brain-dead or dependent on respirators/ventilators for survival.\n\nToo often it is the case that families insist on maintaining such heroic efforts to keep patients ""alive"" in the name of holding out for a ""miracle"".  I have seen this countless numbers of times, and as I have said before, I have NEVER seen such a ""miracle"" take place.  If everything was free and our resources were endless, then that is fine, but unfortunately this sort of practice costs American society (presuming you are American) MILLIONS of healthcare dollars a year, which is causing a huge strain on our economy.\n\nAgain, I do not doubt that they can occur (both miracles in the strict sense or the word, or whether mind over matter or other methods as previous posters have alluded to) but they are extremely rare."
"I'd like some advice on MS (Multiple Sclerosis).?
My grandmother had it and consequently passed away from it, hers was unfortunately the very advanced kind. My mother was diagnosed at age 35 I believe.. she is 47 now. I have exhibited symptoms, but wonder when is a good time to get tested for it? I am 25. How do they test for it? I've brought it up to my PCP ( Primary Care Provider) but most doctors are hesitant to test for this as I've found, since it is a very tricky disease which is hard to diagnose until it's nearly too late to do any good about it. I've also heard mixed results about whether or not the medical community agrees on if it is hereditary or not. I think my family would be a prime example that it IS possible. If you have this, or have family with it I would love your thoughts and insights and any advice you can shed on the subject. Thank you!
I am female and now 49, and was diagnosed w/MS when I was about 24.  At the time I was diagnosed, there was no 'proof positive' test for MS.  I believe the best test now is the MRI.  \nDepending on your relationship with your PCP, I would try to explain about your concerns and possible sysptoms and that you would like to talk to a Neurologist; who would be the doctor to be treating you if you did in fact have MS.  \nThough, remember there are literally thousands of diseases connected to the nerves, and a lot of the symptoms are the same as MS.   \nAs for your concern about being diagnosed '...until it's nearly too late to do any good about it...'  there are no preventative drugs for MS.\nThere are 4 types of severity of MS, and each person can differ from one to another. Also even if family memebers have MS, it doesn't mean they will all have the save 'type' of MS.\nThe newer medications now on the market have been proven to 'keep' the disease in remission for longer and longer periods of time.  (It's been over 5 years for me now, and I contribute it to the new medication - so there is almost always 'something' the doctors are able to do to help with the symptoms.\nThe only real advice I will offer is not to get 'stressed' out by thinking about it. Talk to a Neurologist and get some information from the Hospital Library.  \nI really haven't heard of anyone actually 'dying' from MS, more from commplications of the disease.\nWhen I was diagnosed, I was told the 1st requirement for MS is: a sense of humor! And trust me that piece of advice has helped me through the years..."

"what came first, the chicken or the egg?

Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first. \n\nSo it is Egg technically.

"What was yoga ?

Yoga literally means ""union"", between the individual conscious mind and the higher, universal consciousness, that most people call under different names - God, Allah, Brahman, Ahura Mazda etc. \n\nDifferent sets of practices that have been developed in India in order to attain this goal are also known as Yoga. Some of them have been exported in the West in a fairly simplified form and consist mainly of breathing and stretching techniques. Some others focus on completely other objectives and can be actually harmful for spiritual evolution (and for health too, by the way). \n\nThere is one method that I know that still focusses on the original spiritual goal and actually delivers what is promised. It is called Sahaja Yoga and it is based on meditation and clearing of energy centres using natural elements (water, fire, earth). It has the potential to bring the practitioner physical and emotional balance and to really put a person in touch with themselves. \n\nIt is at present available in almost every country in the world, I think you should really give it a try. Good luck!"

"What is tissue fluid? And how is it formed. Detail please?

Each cell must have the ability to get oxygen, nutrients, get rid of waste products like CO2. This is accomplished by the fluid in the tissues and the fluid around each cell. When blood goes through a capillary fluid can leak to the tissues, this is where it comes from. Now through the process of osmosis some of this fluid must go back into the circulatory system, but not all of it does. The fluids left over makes up the lymphatic fluid and is carried in lymphatic vessels."
"Is it okay too... when your a Christian?
I'm new to Christianity and I had a few questions. My mom says that I'm not allowed to swear (I can see that...), eat chocolate, drink alcohol or anything with caffiene, and I can't watch horror movies or listen to my rock music!! She's Catholic... and I am not... I go to a non-dem. church. Is she just missing with me? Or is she serious?
Your mother is mistaken on some of those things.  You can help her to see that.  \n\nWhat she is correct on is that swearing is not what true Christians would want to do.  If you meant swearing as in saying bad words, Ephesians 5:3-5 says that obscene things should not even be mentioned among you.  Certain types of music are filled with obscene lyrics.  Not always is a type of music all bad, though, and I don't think all rock songs are bad.\n\nHorror movies are objectionable to a Christian conscience because it is a very serious thing to being involved in any form of spiritism.  \n2 Chronicles 33:6 speaks of wicked King Manas'seh.  It says about him: ""And he himself made his own sons pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hin'nom, and practiced magic and used divination and practiced sorcery and made spiritistic mediums and professional foretellers of events.  He did on a grand scale what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah to offend him.""  So this scripture shows that it offends our Creator and it is a great badness to have anything to do with spiritism or demonism.\n \nEven when horror movies do not contain spiritism, they usually contain gross violence.  Watching horror movies, can erode our capacity to sympathize and empathize with the suffering of others.  The apostle Paul condemned those who ""because of the insensibility [literally translated ""dulling""] of their hearts"" came to be ""past all moral sense.""   He encouraged Christians instead to ""become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate."" (Ephesians 4:18,19,32)\n\nAbout chocolate and caffeine: Nowhere in the Bible does it say that there is anything wrong with chocolate or caffeine.\n\nFinally, alcohol is not prohibitted in the Bible, it is something that many of God's servants enjoyed in the past.   In fact the first miracle that Jesus Christ performed, as recorded in the Bible, \nwas at the marriage feast in Ca'na where he turned water into fine wine.  He added to the enjoyment of the wedding celebration by doing this.  (John 2:1-11).  Jesus also used wine as a fitting symbol of his blood when inaugurating the Lord's Evening Meal. (Matthew 26:27-29)\n\nIt was even recommended for medicinal purposes at 1 Timothy 5:23; Luke 10:34\n\nPsalm 104:15 says: ""And wine makes the heart of mortal man rejoice.....""\n\nHowever, drinking a lot of wine, or getting drunk is condemned in the Bible.  Jewish priests were free to drink in moderation when off duty.  However, they were forbidden to drink any alcoholic beverages while engaging in their priestly duties. (Leviticus 10:8-11)  \n\nFirst-century Christians were warned that drunkards ""will not inherit God's Kingdom."" (1 Corinthians 6:9,10)\n\nUnrepentant drunkards were also expelled from the Christian congregation. (1 Corinthians 5:11-13)\n\nAt Proverbs 20:1, the  Bible also says that ""wine is a ridiculer""  meaning that excess alcohol weakens your inhibitions and impairs your judgment so that you do foolish things.  (and sometimes dangerous things.)\n\nI'm sure your mother means well, and is trying to protect you but if she does tell you something is wrong and you are not sure, ask her to show you in the Bible.  Maybe it will help her think about searching for the truth about things in the Bible."
"Why does water in toilets flush counterclockwise in the Eastern hemisphere?
I recently visited Ireland, and realized that. I would like to know why b/c my science teacher made this a grade! It flushes backwards from us, (U.S) and i cant figure out why.
Actually, the ""science fact"" that toilets, tubs, and sinks all drain in the same direction in the Northern hemisphere and drain in the opposite direction in the Southern hemisphere because of the Coriolis Effect (which does cause weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere to go clockwise, and weather patterns in the Southern Hemisphere to go counter-clockwise). The Coriolis Effect is caused by the rotation of the earth.\n\nThe effect of the Coriolis Effect on a body of water the size of a regular toilet, sink or bathtub is nearly negligible. The most common reasons for the direction that water will take in going down the drain have to do with small currents in the water from either filling or other moving objects in the water, and the shape of the basin. In the case of toilets, generally they also put a slight spin on the direction of the flushing water to help it create the whirlpool.\n\nWhile you can divide the world into Western and Eastern hemispheres (usually culturally - the American continents are considered ""Western"" while Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia are considered ""Eastern"", the Coriolis Effect only matters for Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nSo as to answer why it might appear that a toilet in Ireland flushes differently than a toilet in the US, don't blame the rotation of the Earth - the Coriolis Effect on such a small body of water is insignificant to the design of the toilet - the shape of the bowl and where it fills and drains, and any motion created by this shape."

"gall bladders?
my dad is in the hospital because his gall bladder is full of stones and he is gonna have surgery to get the gall bladder taken out...what does a gall bladder do? and what happens when you dont have one in you anymore??
Bile is a product of red blood cell broke down in the spleen which then is stored in gall badder. The main use of Bile is in digestion of fats. When food enters your duodenum (first part of small intestine), if it is fatty, gall bladder secrets Bile into the intestine. What bile does is that it mixes with fat droplet and break them into smaller drops so it is easier for digestive enzymes to break down the fat into triglycerides and other fatty acids so that the body can absorber them. \nHave you ever noticed the droplets of fat in a salad dressing? they seem to want to get together and form a big drop. Bile prevents this to happen in intestine so that body can absorb the fat."
"This is a question mostly for non-christians but anyone can answer.?
I'm just curious. I've been answering questions about religion and spirituality on yahoo questions and one thing always gets me. Why are you all so hateful and rude when you answer questions partaining to Christianity? Why do you use vulger language and suggestive remarks? Even though I am a Christian and proud of my faith, I would never dream of belittling any of you for yours. God gave us all minds of our own, so why bash those whose opinions differ from yours? Please tell me so I can understand.
I am not a Christian but I consciously try not to belittle any religion.  My husband is a Christian as is most of my family.  I believe that each religion is valid to the worshiper and even if it is not yours it should still be given respect."

"i heard that harvard took the average IQ of several religions, what r the results? i remember christians 98?

IQ tests are a bunch of crap and don't reflect in any way how successful someone will be, whether they will be a good lover or parent, or whether you will acheive a certain level of education.  It is interesting though that most serial killers have a high IQ.  I think the biggest thing to come from a high IQ is over thinking and superiority issues."

Many guys don't like to waste semen when they are having non-procreation sex, many practice ""kegels"" to get control over ejaculation so that they can have orgasm without ejaculating, you are one of them, if you don't do kegels then I recommend you to start kegels that way you can have orgasms without ejaculating and you can also become a multi-orgasmic man that way."

Through my experience it has always benefited me more to buy from a private sale that way you don't have monthly payments to make.

However if you have bad credit and a good and steady job history I recommend talking to someone at JDByrider or a place similar to them. They help you reestablish your credit and there payments/down payments aren't to high."
"What progressed the influence of Medical Assistants? All nurses or doctors answer.?
I'm in school and I have something to do for a project but I need to know what first influenced the first Medical Assistants to get the positions they had?
Hope this information is more than enough n helps u in yor project:\n\nPeople could obtain medical help from a large number and variety of practitioners. Poor Christians could ordinarily get relief from their local parishes, sometimes including visitors to the sick poor, and quite a few larger towns and cities supplemented, oversaw, or supplanted these forms of charity with their own systems of poor relief, which sometimes included payment for practitioners who treated the poor. But in most cases, the sick first looked to domestic medicine for help. Many people (mainly women but sometimes men) undoubtedly had favourite recipes and rituals for such purposes, and these were passed on from generation to generation. When problems were too difficult for the family alone, other neighbours could be called upon: strong men such as blacksmiths might set broken bones and dislocated appendages, for example, while other people had special reputations for their knowledge or treatment, often being known by vernacular terms such as “wise-woman” or “wise-man”. They cast spells and used special potions, ointments, and other medicines, often keeping the ingredients secret. Given that most such help remained part of oral traditions, it is very difficult for historians to gain a knowledge of such practices, except where complaints were registered in local courts or otherwise recorded. The early modern period experienced the height of the so-called “witch craze”, and many wise-women and wise-men became its victims (see Witchcraft). Another group of medical assistants were midwives, who sometimes might also happen to be wise-women. As skilful as they often were in helping to ease delivery, midwives sometimes also used various beliefs and practices that would today be classified as “folk” medicine or superstition, such as opening windows and untying knots in order to open all passages. In large communities, some midwives could make a good, regular income from their practice; in such places, many of the best-regarded midwives took apprentices, who paid them for their training in the safe delivery of babies.\n\nAt the same time, many hospitals, which had been places of resort for the poor, aged, and displaced, became increasingly oriented towards caring only for the sick, discharging them when they were well. In England, for instance, after Henry VIII appropriated all church revenues, and in so doing cut away the financial support for most hospitals, five hospitals continued in London with support from the City of London but became more particular in the kinds of people cared for: orphans (Christ’s), the mentally ill (Bethlehem, often shortened to “Bedlam”), the unemployed (Bridewell), or the sick poor (St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’s). In Catholic countries, too, hospitals became increasingly distinct from hospices. In Paris, for instance, the Hôtel Dieu developed into a major institution for the care of the sick, adding four new wings by the end of the 17th century. For those institutions concerned with the sick and mad poor, especially, bedrest and diet remained the bedrock for helping people back on their feet, but medical treatments came to supplement, and in some cases supplant, religious services. Hospitals for the sick poor therefore usually had nurses, apothecaries, and surgeons on the staff for daily assistance, and physicians who visited regularly. Medical personnel began to use the hospitals in the teaching of their apprentices or students, and sometimes they used the inmates of the places as subjects on whom they tried new treatments or surgical methods. Paris had a particularly large number of hospitals and patient beds, and therefore even in the later 17th century attracted many aspiring medical practitioners who wanted to see many examples of illness and treatment at once."

"In a corporation, what's the difference between a president, a secretarty, a CEO, and an owner?

It depends on the corporation.  The CEO is typically above the President of an organization, usually works with the Board of Directors.  A secretary is typically very far down an organizationla list, and aides the white and blue collar workers in their tasks.  (some firms use the term Secretary instead of Vice President, but this is rare).  For a corporation, the owner is not a single person, but several people.  When you hear about a person having stock in a company, that person essentially 'owns' a piece of the company.  So the owners are a primary source of financing for the corporation because they supply the money (through stocks), but owners have actually very little to do with the day-to-day operations of the firm."
"Two years ago i had a divine experience and i was meditating on my heart and focussing on what I was listening
to.  I was so focused on listening and opening my heart that i when i listened to my mother and myself I heard a divine ringing in the voice.  I immediately thought of centurians. Not to drag my question on too longer, but i had an experience with a fish where a man was reeling it in and then i tapped the waters surface.  The fish came to my hands and i picked it up. We threw it back in the water and then the fish came back to me and looked at me with emotion.  Has anyone else had experiences like this, or am i cursed?
Jesus talks about being fishers of people.  People are searching for the truth and a genuine sense of community. Alot of organized religious groups will claim to be fishers but in a sense toss folks back out to the waters because they refuse to accept them.  In your instance it would seem to me that the man is some kind of legalistic person (religion with all the rules).  The fish represents a person seeking the truth, maybe its a relationship with you.  But then for some reason you reject them and then they respond with emotion.  But its not too late to ask for forgiveness from that person and move on in a new friendship with them."

"can some one tell me what exactly masterbating is? just wondering?
i kinda know already
Sigh.  I guess I'll try to answer this the best I can so you don't get some horrible other answer.  Masturbation is the touching of one's own genitals for pleasure, often (but not always) to sexual climax (orgasm).  Men generally do it by rhythmically moving a hand up and down on the penis; women by doing a similar rhythmic motion with the fingertips on the clitoris.\n\nMy recommendation for learning what it is: give it a try!"
"can u love me?...i really need a true love...im 20, girl, mba in finance.. a person who loves me not my body..

The first thing is sight. If you are looking for companionship the other person is going to make an assessment based upon what one sees. Are you worth the time that it takes to say Hello? You must first cross the line of sight obstacles. Love has to start somewhere even if it is in cyberspace. You paint a picture based upon what you read and hear. Love comes very slowly, lust is spontaneous and friendship can be awkward and treacherous. Do not cut yourself in half between the Body and the Soul."

"Why does injecting air into your veins kill you?

This is sort of a myth, with some exceptions.  I remember as a kid hearing that a single bubble of air would kill you.  This is simply not the case.  A small bubble in your vein is not harmful.  Now if you send a large bubble of air back to your heart, you create an air embolism.  Air takes up space and in an enclosed area, like a blood vessel it can get lodged and can prevent blood getting past it.  Even then it may not kill you, but it could cause an infarct (lack of blood/O2 supply causing cellular death)"

Consider starting a journal and include the following.  Write down 3 statements each day that are true about you, that are wholely positive, and that are about things that you are, or things that you can do.  Such as - I can read.  I am a helpful person.  I can change the oil in a car's engine. (These are true - about me.)  Try to write down 3 new things each day - but if you can't think of anything new, re-read your prior pages and write ones you have already written.  It works to help you understand yourself, and since it is true, tells you stuff about yourself that you knew - but don't think about.

"how is the process of homeostasis blood pressure and homeostasis of calcium and phosphate?

They are controlled by hormones. Parathyroid gland controls calcium level of your body by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). Blood pressure is controlled by adrenal glands. It secretes adrenaline, aldosterone and cortisol. The body regulates phosphate levels in the blood through the controlled release of PTH from the parathyroid gland and calcitonin from the thyroid gland."

Hi! I noticed that this question was asked by a ""Miss Mysterious"" some months ago. I really want to know what the replies were to that question...is there a way I can find that question again here?\nPlease help!!!
A study reported in a recent issue of the journal Cancer Research suggests that eating a diet full of beans, nuts and cereals may help prevent cancer. This is because these foods contain an active compound that inhibits the growth of cancers.\n\nScientists found the anti-cancer agent called inositol pentakisphosphate at the University College London. The scientist were cited by Reuters as saying the substance, also found in lentils and peas, may direct researchers to develop new drugs against cancer.\n\nThe compound, as explained by the scientists, acts upon an enzyme called phosphoinositide 3-kinase and inhibits tumor growth.\n\nIn the current study, the scientists proved the anti-cancer properties of inositol pentakisphosphate in mice and cancer cells in the laboratory. It was found that this compound killed tumor cells and boosted the effect of drugs used against cancer cells such as ovarian and lung cancer cells.\n\nAccording to the study, the compound is non-toxic, which allows it to be used at high concentrations to aid chemotherapy.\n______________________________________________\nThe second link lists the top ten anti cancer foods as well...

"Does anyone know any home remedies for dry sockets (wisdom teeth)?
I just recently had my lower wisdom teeth pulled. I have stitches in the back of my mouth and one side kinda hurts but it's not too bad. The other side however (over the past 12 hours) has been increasing in pain. the pain seems to be running down into my jaw. I think it's probably a dry socket, being as there is a blood clot covering the side that doesn't hurt (which is normal), but the other side doesn't look the same. I can't see a blood clot. So I was wondering, if there is anything I can do right now. My dentist office isn't open yet, and it's really becoming painful.
i don't know any solution for your pain but mabye a quick trip to the ER. Can you think of anything that you did that could have been a result of your possible dry socket?

A. independent gametophytes\nB. pollen grains\nC. fruits\nD. roots\nE. leaves
Here's what I learned:\n\nBoth gymnosperms and angiosperms have vascular tissue and both produce seeds. However, the seeds of angiosperms are surrounded by the wall of the ovary of the flower which forms the fruit, whereas gymnosperms do not possess this structure. Their seeds are described as naked (Gymnosperm from the Greek: gymnos - naked, sperm - seed).

I closed a checking account at a bank about 4 years ago.  Between now and then that bank was purchased by another institution who then basicly shut its doors.  Does the purchasing bank have to keep the records of all closed accounts the original bank had?  And if so for how long?
Record retention depends on the law of land and differ from country to country and type of the record. So you have to check out in your country whether these records are required to be kept for so long. \n\nOn debt, there is law of limitation which states that someone cannot claim debt after certain period if you have not acknowledged that for specific period.

It's really fun and i do really enjoy it. Which direction shall i go for? Shall i stay in the Marketing or shall i try to re-apply to the UN. since working with the UN has been my dream since i was a little girl. I don't want to be one of those people who spend 4 years studying what they want and in the end they end up working something else and convince themselves that they like what they are currently doing.\nShall i keep on applying for the UN? or shall i continue what i am doing and build up my career?
work on the 2  ;)\n\nkeep ur work in the hotel ...and enjoy ur time ...\n\nand by thats time try to apply for the UN jobs ... so could one day had thats job , thats were ur dream ...\n\ngood luck for you"
"Is it bad that I live at home at the age of 26 if I pay all my own  bills and rent?
I am also in a relationship that is heading towards marriage one day soon.
no, it's not bad as long as you are responsible and pay your bills and your parents don't have a problem...If you haven't already finished college I would definately take advantage of that before you get married you want to be financially set before you start a family."
"What is the explanation for the emerging of a black hole (in space) -> what are the causes?

I believe there are two kinds of black holes. One I'm sure everyone will explain to ya, a great mass so large that light can't even escape it's gravity. But the other kind is theoretical: What if everything in THIS universe came from somewhere else? That is the only way I can explain it, except that somehow we are all headed for it again, to be sucked into it and expel ed into another place which right now is completely void, and this universe would be turned inside-out again."
"can someone PLEASE PLEASE help me with these math problems!!!!...?
Problem 1: Find an equation for the line with y-intercept 3 that is perpendicular to the line y=2/3x-4. & Problem 2: If P(4,-5) is a point on the graph of the function y=f(x), find the corresponding point on the graph of y=2f(x-6).
Problem 1: Find an equation for the line with y-intercept 3 that is perpendicular to the line y=2/3x-4\n\nto find a line perpendicular to another line, use the opposite reciprocal of the slope\nin this case, the slope is 2/3, therefore the opposite reciprocal of the slop is -3/2\nnow you know the slope and you also know that the y-intercept is 3\nuse the equation y = mx + b\nif m is the slope and b is the y-intercept, then your equation is\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 3\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nProblem 2: If P(4,-5) is a point on the graph of the function y=f(x), find the corresponding point on the graph of y=2f(x-6)\n\ny = 2f(x-6)\ny/2 = f(x-6)\ny = -5\nx = 4\nplug them into the equation\n-5/2 = f(4-6)\n-5/2 = f(-2)\nx = -2\ny = -5/2\n\nthus the answer is\nx = -2\ny = -5/2\nhaving trouble with this one myself... sry... dont know the answer"

"What to do about sleeping problems???
If you are 14 could ADHD cause sleeping problems. This boy is not sleeping at night. Could part of still be from losing his father in Dec. 05? What can I do to help him sleep normally again??? Thank you for any help. He already has enough problems without being able to sleep too.
What you can do to help him is be a friend. Let him know he can talk to you and listen to him if he decides to tell you his feelings. \n\nI don't think the ADHD is causing the problem as much as the grief over losing his father.14 is an age that is very hard to lose a parent. He may not feel normal for a whole year. \n\nHe needs to discuss this with his doctor. His doctor will tell him if he needs to visit with a therapist or if he needs medicine to help with sleep or with his bad feelings.\n\nSince he's a guy, he may not have told his mother yet. She can help him figure out what to do, but if she doesn't know, here's what you do. \n\nWait until all three of you are in the same room and all discussing something together and turn to your friend and ask him in front of her, while she's listening if he is still having trouble sleeping at night. She will find out. He won't have to talk about it and you won't be in trouble for telling her behind his back. He might be irritated with you at the moment, but the important thing is his mom finds out so she can help him."
"Is diabetes a genetic disorder?

Type I diabetes is caused by genetic susceptibility alone. No one who has the type got it through being lazy or having a bad diet. There was no way to prevent it.\n\nType II is a lifestyle disease caused by susceptible people not taking care of themselves, eating a high carb/sugar diet and not exercising properly. The susceptibility is inheritable; however, the lifestyle choices belong exclusively to the individual.\n\nThe short answer is that, yes, diabetics can be a genetic disorder."
"I hear about alot of people asking about female problems.?
Everyone that ask about female itching is told crab. First why and second is there a cure for crabs?
I suppose the reason you see that answer so often is that some people don't realize how many causes there are for genital itching.  A yeast infection is a very common cause of vaginal itching.  Most women get at least one yeast infection in their lives.  This problem can be cured by over-the-counter medication, although you should consult a doctor to make sure you really do have a yeast infection (see second link).  Yeast infections are rarely sexually transmitted.\n\n""Crabs"" are actually pubic lice.  They are treated in exactly the same way as head lice--washing with special shampoos, then removing the dead nits with a fine-toothed comb and making sure to wash all clothing and linens in order to prevent reinfestation."

"what is a monohybrid?

Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a single characteristic. The different forms of the characteristic are usually controlled by different alleles of the same gene. For example, a monohybrid cross between two pure-breeding plants (homozygous for their respective traits), one with yellow seeds and one with green seeds, would be expected to produce an F1 (first) generation with only yellow seeds because the allele for yellow seeds is dominant to that of green.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monohybrid"

"Bipolar w/ panic/anxiety attacks?
Hi, how many of you out there are Bipolar and have severe panic and anxiety attacks and cope without medication? I am bipolar and suffer from serious panic/anxiety disorder but can't stay on the meds. Too expenisve!!! I am a mom of 3 lil ones and a script for $300 a month is just not in the plan!! Any of you cope with out meds? there are times I try. All i hear from everyone is "" its all in your head"" and so I try to focus and deal and calm myself and there are times I jsut feel so out of control and lost and scared and just basically in adownward spiral.
First and foremost pray and then start looking for information to help you with anxiety attacks because the Bible says Seek and you WILL (not may) find .Believe me, having been through anxiety attacks I know how motivated you are to get help. I believe you will get help and I am on your side in the battle.\n\nIt is very important to do this with the guidance of a trained Psychologist or Psychiatrist but there are ways to cope with this problem without medication in many instances.\n\nOften panic attacks are the result of some kind of psychological trauma. In my case I almost died from a heart problem. Most of my life I have not had them but when I did they were doozies. You must guard against incompetent Medical people. In my case the Dr. prescribed enough of a drug in the same class as Valium (can't remember the name now) to sedate a horse. These drugs do not address the underlying problem although in some severe cases may be necessary. The benzodiazapenes such as Valium and Xanax are addictive. The only drug I take now is a drug that regulates the heartbeat.\n\nBe particularly careful about the Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors such as Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. Again in extreme cases they may be necessary and regardless always go with a Doctor's advice(just make sure they are competent). What I am stating is my own opinion derived from personal experience but it is well founded since I am well now and was at one point a basket case. I had a very bad experience with Zoloft, promptly quit and don't need it.\n\nHeres what I found:\n\nDon't laugh, but many times anxiety attacks are caused by hyperventilating. When you hyperventilate you are actually changing the chemical composition of the blood. It is a vicious spiral because the more you get anxious the more you hyperventilate which makes you more anxious ad infinitum. I am not talking about conciously hyperventilating but rather hyperventilation you are not necessarily aware of, basically improper and shallow breathing. A good site that explains it is http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/anxiety/christine/treatment_breathing_techniques.htm\n\nSometimes if you will slow the rate at which you breathe and breathe from your diaphragm, you can mitigate your anxiety. Babies breathe from their bellies, adults and sometimes even children breathe in a shallow manner not extending their bellies out as they take in a breath.  Due to the excessive levels of stress all around us we become desensitized and don't even realize how much we have been affected. I remember going out into the country and for awhile the extreme quiet got on my nerves until I got used to it and then what an incredible good feeling came over me.\n\nThere is another technique for dealing with the acute portions of an anxiety attack. There is a book by Dr. Claire Weekes called Hope and Help for your Nerves. She talks about the 4 stages (1 Facing 2)Accepting 3) Floating \n4) Letting time pass . I highly recommend that you purchase her book . For me, the facing part is acknowledgeing that even though you feel as if you will die and it is extremely uncomfortable , you will not likely die. The accepting part is just acknowledging that since you will not likely die you can accept your condition. This becomes easier as the severity of the attacks begin to lessen. 3) Floating for me was a process of stepping outside of myself and observing objectively what was going on 4) Letting time pass is facilitated by realizing that the attack will diminish over time . This realization allows you to become occupied doing something else. I am by no means  a trained Psychologist but the techniques worked for me and I am definitely well now and I think it is possible you will be too. \n\nOh and be sure to get a complete medical workup. Sometimes anxiety attacks are realted to a thyroid condition or mitral valve prolapse."

"whats the difference between wheel alignment & wheel balancing in a car? how does one go about it?

Wheel alignment is how aligned wheels are with respect to each other. For example, you wouldnt want your front wheels to point away from each other.... they would rub themselves off as they rolled.  \n\nWheel balancing is balancing the weight of the wheel on its center. If one side of a tire was to weigh a few ounces heavier then the other side, it would vibrate when you drive at higher speeds.\n\nJust take your car to a repair shop."

"Why are the questions in the GLBT section so limiting?
It seems that you always see the same questions over and over..\n\n""How can I tell if someone is gay""?\n\n""How do I know if I'M gay""?\n\n""Should gays be allowed to marry""?\n\n""Are all gays going to hell""?\n\nIs that REALLY all the GLBT community is about?  Or is that all that people feel belong as ""appropriate"" questions in this category?  Why can't people see us as real people with brains that think about ALL kinds of things, rather than just focus on a few things that ALWAYS come up over and over and only relate to our sexuality? Haven't we given the answers to these questions the FIRST million times they were asked? Also, some of these questions have been asked repeatedly in the news (like gay marriage) so do you not watch the news? Or do you just feel the need to be the million and ONE person to ask the same question?
It is not that we are so limited ourselves, rather we are being limited by Yahoo!  Many people have asked questions that we may find intriguing, but some others have found them offensive in some way and reported them.  The result?

Also, what is the quickest way possible to get a debit card?\n\nThank you in advance.
Debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo is one attached to a checking account.

"Can you fire a revolver pistol after it fell in the water and is wet?
Can you fire it under water?
Gun ammunition holds explosive charge INSIDE the cartridge.  When the hammer on the firearm hits the rear of the cartridge, the charge is ignited, and the bullet is propelled forward.\n\nAs long as the cartridge is waterproof, the pistol should fire fine if it got wet.  Here are two sites that mention that [seem to imply] that cartridges are generally waterproof:\nhttp://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/425/425lect06.htm\nhttp://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/bullets.htm\n\nAs for firing underwater, it would probably depend on the gun.  They're not specifically designed for the resistance that a gun barrel filled with water would give, but remember that bullets are designed to create force primarily along the forward axis, not sideways.  I'd imagine that modern gun barrels are strong enough to handle an underwater shot, though you'd get an enormous kickback from the resistance.\n\nNote that I'm no gun expert, but I think the notions about guns not firing when wet and exploding underwater are based on older-style weapons.  When you pour dry gunpowder into a musket, it's exposed to the weather, and wouldn't ignite if it got wet.  And it's explosive force is outward, and so if the barrel has slight resistance, it might just explode.\n\n\nEdited To Add:\n[Here's a cool explanation of some testing of underwater shooting.  In short: the guns fired fine, no damage to the guns, though the cartridges jammed after firing.  Your mileage may vary.]\nhttp://www.loadammo.com/Topics/May02.htm"

"Scientists: If you were a Coca Cola bottle...?
...and you were air-tight and vaccuumed and ready to be shipped to your vendor, what would happen if you experienced an extreme range of temperatures?  Ex.  You start out in a refrigerated truck at about 38 F, and you land in your new owner's car in the Texas sun at about 99 F.  Then you're opened.  Are the contents unaffected by the changes in temperature, e.g. does condensation ever play a role inside the bottle?\n\n(This question came about during Chinese takeout.  A packet of soy sauce lay on top of steaming hot egg drop soup, and the packet was noticeably warm.  I wondered, will this be spoiled because the soy sauce got warm?  I know that there are a lot of bottling/canning rules that come into play here... probably stuff my grandmother knew in her plum preserves making days...)\n\nTHANKS!
First of all, there cannot be a vacuum inside a bottle of Coke.  Coke is largely water with CO2 gas dissoved in it, under pressure.  If you were to try to make a vacuum inside, the CO2 would simply bubble out, until the soda became ""flat.""  If a sealed bottle of Coke is heated up, the pressure inside rises.  That's because the solubility of gases in water decreases with increasing temp.  More of the CO2 is forced out of solution, which increases the pressure inside the bottle.  If it gets hot enough, the cap could blow off, or the bottle could explode.  If you heat it up, and it doesn't blow up, then cool it back down, it will be unchanged.  As for whether the Coke will still taste OK, it will, unless it's subjected to high temperature long enough to cause the kola flavoring to decompose.  That would take a long time."

"Should children, 14 & younger, who commit violent crimes be treated as adults in court?

Wow, this is a hard one.  First of all, all kids are not the same.  Some have learnig diasbilities and really have no idea what the consequences are for their crimes, and even if they are puniched as adults, still won't understand what is happening to them.  The ones who are fully capable of understanding what they are doing at the time of the crime, if violent, should be treated as an adult.  To do things they know are wrong just for the sake of dong them is wrong.  So, in answer to your question, I guess you would have to take it case by case and see who knows what and if the mentality is that of an adult."

"What causes heat rash and what (if anything) should be don to get rid of it?

The rash is caused by a blockage and inflammation of sweat ducts during times of exposure to heat and high humidity. These blocked sweat ducts cause sweat to escape into adjacent tissue thus producing the itching and prickling sensations associated with the condition.\n\nTreating heat rash is simple and usually does not require medical assistance. Other heat-related problems can be much more severe.\n\n    * Wear light, loose-fitting soft clothes. Avoid clothing that traps heat and moisture. Natural fabrics such as cotton are best.\n    * Stay in cool or air-conditioned, or well-ventilated environments. Use a fan if necessary.\n    * Take frequent cool baths or showers. Dry yourself thoroughly and dust bland types of powder (such as unperfumed talcum powder) on body creases and affected areas.\n    * Apply calamine lotion or prickly rash lotions to soothe the affected areas, but avoid using ointments or creams — they keep the skin warm and moist and may make the condition worse.\n    * Do not scratch."

"Why does a star clock work?
I need a very simple explanation for a third grader.
The Earth turns one time around in 24 hours and as it does the whole sky seems to turn around the North star. Of course the sky is really not moving at all. The Earth under our feet is turning, but it really does LOOK like the sky is turning! The North star never rises or sets because it is right above Earth's north pole, so as the Earth turns it just stays there in one spot while the whole sky seems to turn around it. Stars close enough to the north star can go around without ever rising or setting. So the sky looks like a big clock, but a 24 hour clock. You may have seen special military clocks that have 24 numbered hours and the hour hand goes once around in a day. It is kind of silly anyway having 12 hours on the clock and making the hour hand go around twice a day. Who made that up?\n\nAnyway, you can use the stars in the sky as your dial and the north star as the center of that dial. Only the dial turns and the hands stay still. Oops, we have no hands! We will just imagine a hand always pointing up and let the dial turn behind it. And there are not really numbers, you have to draw a picture of the stars and write numbers on it so you can compare the sky to it and tell time.\n\nClick the link below for instructions."
"Is H. pylori a normal flora of the stomach?
or it is pathogenic bacteria?
There is not really any normal flora of the stomach, though a little over half the world's population has H pylori in the stomach.  This does not mean that they all have ulcers, though.  The immune system will attempt to defeat the infection, but it is usually unable to reach the H pylori due to its odd location.  It is possible that some of what causes an ulcer is not the bacteria itself but the body's inflammatory response."
"How does eye color change over time?

All eye color can change over time because of age or, unfortunately, disease. \n\nEye disease is a cause of color change. So, ask a doctor to examine your eyes if you notice a slow loss of color. The change could be due to Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis, Horner's Syndrome, and pigmentary glaucoma, says Brian DeBroff, ophthalmology professor at Yale University. \n\nAging, however, is the usual cause of color change over time. So, yes, Emily. Color can change as we age. It does so for 10 to 15% of the normal Caucasian population. These people's eyes change slowly over many years after they reach adolescence. \n\nHow and why eye color changes - Pigment in the stroma (the connective tissue of the front layer of the iris) gives the iris color. Iris color can lighten if the number of pigment granules in the stroma decreases or if the granules produce lighter pigment. (See figure.) The iris can also lose color if the stroma pigment degrades. \n\nEyes, unlike skin and hair, do not synthesize color pigment continuously. Instead, eyes retain the pigment granules and accumulate them in the iris stroma. So, if the pigment degrades, the eye color lightens.\n\nLikewise, eyes can darken if the number of pigment granules increase or if the granules make darker pigment.\n\nThat's how the color changes. Why does it change? Genetics is the key as experimenters learned by studying twins. They observed the eyes and skin of identical twins and non-identical twins of American Caucasians between the ages of 3 months to 6 years. \n\nBoth sets of twins showed a ""darkening with age of both the hair and eye colour,"" says Sturm. The identical twins changed color together, at essentially the same rate. The non-identical twins changed color but at different rates, which indicates a ""strong genetic influence in the timing of these colour changes.""\n\nEye color probably changes for the same reason we have one head instead of two: genes. Genes determine all body characteristics — including changing eye color as we age."

"How do horses sleep?
Do they sleep standing up? I've never really seen a horse on it's side.
Horses sleep standing up they will rest one leg at a time.kinda taking the weight off of it..I have owned several horses and you will never catch one sleeping! Horses can and do lay down but not for long periods they may lay in the sun abit after a cold night and they love a good roll in a sandy area..mostly after you wash them......(Go figure!) But if you ever see one down who keeps rolling and doesnt want to get up it generly has colic which is very serious and can twist their intestines killing them..You gotta get them up and walk them till the Vet gets there..Horses arent built to lay down long their body weight is too much..It just isnt meant to be!!!"

if u drop ur mobile in the water the keapad will be affected and the battery may short. if u drop it to ground with force, assuming the screen has not broken, the only thing that can happen is that the SIM card may be released. the IC chips are airtight and cannot be broken easily. the screen is airtigh as the screen will be hermatically sealed. the parts prone to damage is the battery and the keypad."
"What happens to the size of the metal ions as you go down group I? Why?
What happens to the size of the metal ions as you go down group I? Why?
This applies for all groups.\nThe general trend for atoms as you move down a group is for the size of the atoms to increase.\nThis is partially accounted for by the shielding of outer electrons by inner electrons. Also because atoms further down a group have more energy levels creating more distance between the nucleus and valence electrons."
"Is race and ethnicity real?
Or just a socially constraucted mechanism used to divide us?\n\nIs the difference in skin colour and hair texture down to mutations or is there another explaination?
The reason why people have problems with this concept is simply because they fail to understand the difference between a BIOLOGICAL reality and a CULTURAL reality.\n\nLook, if we wanted to we could group people by shirt colour couldn’t we? People with blue, green or purple shirts in one group, red yellow and orange in another and blacks, whites and greys making a third group? Do you agree that we could do that? We could then choose as a SOCIETY to teat those groups differently. We can tax them at different rates, throw them in prison whatever we like. \n\nWhat we have here is an example of a CULTURAL reality. The division of people by shirt colour is indisputably real. It indisputably has real effects on the real lives of real people. By any standard you like it is real. But do you also accept that such a division by shirt colour is not based in BIOLOGY? Do you accept that there is no common genetic thread amongst all the people in the green shirt group? Do you accept that it is perfectly possible for two people who are very closely related BIOLOGICALLY to be placed in totally separate shirt groups?\n\nWell, race is no different in any way at all. We have traditionally grouped people according to certain racial features. Those features were chosen at random, they are just as random as shirt colour. And they tell us no more about the person than shirt colour does. \n\nThat is what we mean when we state that race has no BIOLOGICAL reality. Black people are not closely related to one another. A random black person has a greater chance of being related to a White person or an Asian person than to another Black person. A White person has the same chance of being related to a black person as to another White. The only common feature held by Black people is the feature that we used to define them in the first place: black skin. That’s it.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes race is real. Nobody has ever denied that race is very, very real. How could you anyone possibly deny that race is real?  But race is CULTURALLY and HISTORICALLY real. It is not BIOLOGICALLY real.\n\n>>>>> Is the difference in skin colour and hair texture down to mutations\n\nIf you go back far enough, yes. But what  you need to realise that it isn’t just one mutation. There is no common skin colour gene found amongst all black people or all white people.  Heck, there isn’t even a common skin colour found amongst all the people we define as Black or White. That is precisely why race has no biological meaning."
"looking for a blank business note to fill in the spaces?

Ooooh, not a good idea!\n\nCanned business notes can be purchased in kits at Staples and or OfficeMax.\n\nBut you should not use one unless you can fully understand the legalese involved and what the consequences are if there is a breach.  If you don't understand the canned note, you can still get shafted -- and maybe even worse.\n\nYou're better off:\n\n1) documenting the loan using a common sense letter which you sign and the borrower signs (you keep the original)\n\n2) making the loan with a check never in cash (you'll want to fill in that Memo line at the bottom with something like: ""loan to Jack to be pd on 3/3/2006"". \n\n3) keeping the cancelled check;\n\n4) requiring payment using a cashier's check or money order (never cash and never with a personal check)."
"When people are mean on YA does that reflect poorly on them or more on the people?
who laugh and agree with them?
Usually reflects on them but sometimes the questions really are dumb and then it reflects on both parties. It's still tiresome and annoying to hear rude and mean answers regardless of how dumb the question is. It also seems like a lot of people forget that their are people on YA that are immersed in different cultures and have an entirely different value system. When people don't realize this or just don't care and put the questioners down that really, really, ticks me off. I wish people showed off their good/tolerant/intelligent nature more often.

fair trade is where farmers who make the product in third world countries get a fair price for there goods instead of three or four pence per eg 100 bars of chocolate. the whole reason is to ask people who here buys these products and if not WHY ?????
I do occasionally chocolate and cereal bars and a few other things.... but they are expensive, although they don't need to be the supermarkets still make the same profit on these items as they do on the standard produce all the expense is passed on to the consumer.\n\nToo much greed from the big chain stores as if 100+% profit isn't enough.

"My friend is suffering from retina degeneration.  Is there any any permanent solution for this?

Retina Degeneration is very dangerous 4 eyes. And in the medical science there is no parmanent solution. On the occurance of retina degeneration patient should have 2 go 4 a laser treatement, it is a simple 2 minutes operation, but it can't stop the future occurance of the same or related problems. In the retina degeneration the retina becomes very thin campared 2 the normal thickness, due to this the patient have to face eye weekness.\nAnd according 2 medical science they have no solution.\n\nBut nature have solution 4 this problem.

"help with Algebra?
i am having a hard time understanding how to subtract in algebra.it's confusing the heck out of me.\n\nfor instane   +2   -   -5=???   so it turns to   +2   +  +5=  +7??\n\nor when it's  \n\n-2 - -5=     =   +2 + +5=  +7\n\n\ndo i just turn them into addition problems indiscriminantly???\ni am kinda lost..
I'll just explain the rules, and then go on:\n\nMinus a negative is ""addition.""\nThink about it:  You are taking away a negative amount:  What does that mean?  You are adding it.  It sort of makes sense conceptually, you just need to ""ponder"" it, if you will.\n\nPlus a negative is ""subtraction.""\nYou are adding a negative amount.  What does that mean?  You are taking it away.  For all of these, just think about what they mean and you'll probably have an easier time.\n\nMinus a positive is ""subtraction."" \nThis is fairly simple.  It means that you are taking away a positive amount.  That's all you're doing with this one.\n\nPlus a positive is ""addition.""\nYou are adding a positive amount to the other number/variable/etc.  This should be straightforward as well.\n\nOn a technicality, +2--5 = +2-(-5) = +2+5=+7\n\nAlso, -2--5=\n-2-(-5)=-2+5=+3\n\nYou don't randomly add plus or minus signs.  You need to sort of ""combine"" them when you run into a positive or negative, or two negatives.  Just follow the rules I outlined.  Don't touch ones that are alone (like the - in front of the 2).\n\nHope this helps."
"If someone in your family needed a kidney?
Lets say that this person had sexually abused you as a child, would you still give them one of your own kidneys? (Most healthy people can live with one kidney). Would you do it?
If someone in your family needed a kidney? \nLets say that this person had sexually abused you as a child, would you still give them one of your own kidneys? (Most healthy people can live with one kidney). Would you do it?\n\nYes...you are definitely correct! Healthy people can live with one kidney.\nBut not every healthy people can right away donate kidney. As a donor, you need to undergone a series of examination test such as HLA compatibility test to identify the degree of rejection probability by recipient to your kidney. As FYI, every single individual is unique, even identical twin can reject the kidney of his/her sibling twin.\n\nThat is why doctors uses immuno suppresant drugs and steroids after surgical operation to minimize or delay the rejection time of the tissue implant.\n(If you are familiar with the movie film ""THE ISLAND"", they used the technology of clonning to solve the issues of tissue implant problem.)\n\nAs for the question of family dilemma...that is the hardest part. It will took me a couple more time before i answer your question. Because of considering i was sexually abused by this person....it is very traumatic!! Maybe after i finally agree to donate my kidney, he/she is lying 6 feet under the ground.\n\ni hope this one is helpful to you!"

"melting glass?
Is it possible to melt a hole in glass with a normal blow torch.
No\nNot only does the torch not get hot enough (by ""normal"" I'm assuming a propane torch) but the flame isn't concentrated enough.  Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.  Stick with a specialized glass drill bit for that hole."
"When two lines become parallel and perpendicular to each other at the same time?
Give the equation of the pair of lines.
Here's a quasi-logical answer:\nBy definition, two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (s1=s2) and they are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1 (s1*s2=-1)\n\nSo we have s1=s2 and s1*s2=-1\nTherefore s1^2=-1, so s1=s2=i=sqrt(-1)\nIn conclusion, any two lines y=ix+a and y=ix+b are both parallel and perpendicular at the same time."

Then I started reading web site after web site. Wow! Who knew? Anyway, one web site had this info I thought informative towards your question:\n \nThe period that will start from 24th November is called the 5th Day of the Galactic Underworld. 5th day is known to be the brightest of the 7 days of creation. These 7 days of creation that takes place according to the Mayan calendar, are also mentioned in three monotheist religion's books (Old Testament, New Testament and Quran).\n\nThe 5th day brought about in the previous levels of the pyramid:\n·5 billion years ago our Solar System was born. (In the 5th Day of that level-of-time) \n·300 million years ago, Reptiles came into existence. Breakthrough of animal life from water to land. (In the 5th Day of that level-of-time) \n·800,000 years ago, humans discovered fire. (In the 5th Day of that level-of-time) \n·2,000 years ago, Jesus came and brought a message that went around the world. (In the 5th Day of that level-of-time) \n·100 years ago, Einstein discovered the theory of relativity; the theory that explains our world. (In the 5th Day of that level-of-time).\nWhat do you think the 5th day will bring at this time? \n\nAlso another site had this info: \n\nBetween 2011 and 2012”, there will be “the return of an energy system that existed here a long time ago”, and it will culminate in an “electromagnetic polar Earth shift” between 2012 and 2014.\nHope this helps. :}"

"How does chromatography work?

What Is It??\nHello, everyone, and welcome to the wonderful world of chromatography! What is chromatography, you ask?? Well, quite simply, it is a broad range of physical methods used to separate and or to analyze complex mixtures. The components to be separated are distributed between two phases: a stationary phase bed and a mobile phase which percolates through the stationary bed. \n  \n  \nHow Does It Work? Like Magic!\nA mixture of various components enters a chromatography process, and the different components are flushed through the system at different rates. These differential rates of migration as the mixture moves over adsorptive materials provide separation. Repeated sorption/desorption acts that take place during the movement of the sample over the stationary bed determine the rates. The smaller the affinity a molecule has for the stationary phase, the shorter the time spent in a column."

it depends onthe type of snacks your looking for.

Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.\n \nLet’s talk about metabolism. What is all this media hype about the metabolism? Why is it worthy of grabbing front page headlines in every fitness magazine? \n\nThe term metabolism, derived from the Greek language, simply means change or transformation. Our metabolism is what turns foods into energy. The higher the metabolic rate, the higher the caloric output. It is a necessary function that allows our bodies to use food and other resources to maintain the working parts, repair damage, heal injury and rid the body of toxins. In other words, metabolism is a necessary process, without which living organisms would die.\n\nMetabolism aids in digestive function as well as absorption of nutrients. It is most affected by nutrition, hydration and physical activity. Each of these items is an imperative aspect of optimum metabolic health. When any one of these is lacking, the metabolic rate decreases. Consequently, weight loss and weight maintenance are directly related to healthy metabolism.\n\nWhen does our metabolism work? Well the truth is it’s always working, even when you are sleeping. A well designed fitness program will elevate the metabolic rate. Below are nine closely guarded steps to increasing your metabolic rate.\n\n1. Eat protein at every meal, including breakfast.\n\n2. Eliminate wheat- and flour-based products for the time being. And yes, that definitely includes bread and pasta. \n\n3. Eat unprocessed foods. Ninety percent of what you eat should be a combination of (in this order of importance) raw vegetables, steamed vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and a few fruits. \n\n4. Reduce starch to one portion a day, and don't eat that portion during your evening meal. Best choices of starches are beans, sweet potatoes, and oatmeal. \n\n 5. Reduce or eliminate dairy for the time being, especially cow's milk. Exceptions: reasonable amounts of low sugar, fat free yogurt. \n\n6. Lose the booze. Despite what the ""studies"" say, you lose no health benefits by giving up alcohol (including wine). There is nothing essential in al"
"what does it mean when you taste metal in your mouth?

Blood cells contain hemoglobin which carries oxygen. When blood breaks down, iron is released and causes a metallic taste in mouth. Bleeding can be from the gums, sinuses or nose. The taste can get especially bad when someone has post nasal drip and the dried blood sticks to the back of the throat. If bleeding gums are the cause there is often bad breath associated with the bad taste.\n\nAnother uncommon reason for a metallic taste in mouth is due to small electric currents in the mouth. When two types of metals are used in two different dental fillings a battery can be created. Some believe that it's due to the mercury leakage from dental silver/mercury fillings.\n\nMany oral or IV medications such as thyroid medicine, penicillin, and lithium can give a metallic taste in mouth. When someone is allergic to a specific food, the food can often be detected even in extremely small amounts. Food allergies, such as with sulfur dioxide, can also cause this. Some gastrointestinal disorders can be aggravated by food allergies and cause burping, dry mouth, thirst, rectal itching and a metal taste. High protein diets can cause benign dietary ketosis. This has also been associated with a metal taste.\n\nChemotherapy, radiation therapy, or cancer itself can cause a metallic taste in mouth. It has also been associated with B 12 deficiency, zinc deficiency, Bell's palsy, Strep throat and Sjogren's disease along with anything that causes dry mouth. \n\nhttp://www.atlantadentist.com/metallic_taste_in_mouth.html\n\nAND:\n\nA metallic taste in the mouth can be caused by infections of the mouth or teeth, skin conditions that affect the mucous membranes in the mouth such as lichen planus, or other problems, such as Crohn's disease.\n\nA metallic taste also may be caused by a substance present in the mouth. Medications that are chewed, rather than swallowed, may cause a temporary metallic taste at the back of the tongue. Other medications, such as Flagyl, tetracycline, penicillamine, Biaxin, ethambutol, biguanides, or allopurinol, can cause a metallic taste because they get into the mouth through salivary secretions or directly from the blood. \n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/not257897.asp"

"How can a God fearing christian vote for elected officials who support abortion?
I was once registered as a democrat. After I saw every democrat official supporting abortion, I had to ask how would Jesus vote. Then I went out and registered republican.

"Do you enjoy enacting the 'silly' in public?
I'll explain my question with a possible anecdote of my own:\n\nI go grocery shopping with me kids.  In order to make things interesting I have previously obtained walkie talkies and we separate up into two separate covert groups with our list of objectives divied between us.  We (both separate groups)are very careful around corners and utilize our coverperson to check to ensure the coast is clear and subsequently to cover us whilst we obtain the items in question. Etc.\n\nIn short, we turn a mundane shopping trip into an adventure.  We get more than a couple odd looks. :)  Does anybody else participate in similar activities?
Yes. This activity is also great stress relief. Every year for Christmas, I travel home and meet up with my brother (both of us are in our 30s now) and we have sooo much fun just being ""silly"" in public. He was singing his loudest at the mall Christmas songs and turning the shopping carts making noise with them... just attracting attention from everyone. It is sooo much fun, especially when you know you probably won't see these people again.\n\nWe also went on a cruise a few years ago and did some ""silly"" things there. Pushing all the buttons in the elevators, regardless of who was watching. He got the waiters to cut up his food for him during the meals. Some people were talking extremely loud and annoying, so we started doing the same thing (and they shut up).\n\nDuring the family reunions, we do the walkie talkie things. We usually meet up in a small town somewhere and then the entire family (usually over a 100 of us) spread out and go shopping and what not. That's when we break out the walkie talkies... trying to talk in code and attract attention...\n\nThis is really fun to do and such a great stress relief. Some people are just embarrassed by the whole thing, but I look forward to it everytime we get together."
"how to stop creditors wage garnishment?

The laws and procedures vary by state, so I encourage you to consult a local attorney for further advice.  As an attorney with experience setting up wage garnishments, I can offer a few comments.\n\n1.  Creditors are almost always willing to listen even if they have a judgment.  Try negotiating a payment plan you can live with.\n\n2.  If you are appealing the judgment, most states will require you to put up collateral for an appeal bond.\n\n3.  You might be able to file a claim of exemption.  Some states have laws that allow judges to reduce the amount of garnishment due to economic hardship.  If you live paycheck to paycheck and need every dime to pay rent, the judge my reduced or stop the garnishment.  You should see a local attorney or maybe the court clerk to get the necessary forms.\n\n4.  Bankruptcy is an option to consider.  Filing bankruptcy will stop garnishment right away.  Consult a qualified bankruptcy attorney."

"Why don't people remove their hats when dining (in or out)?
What is happening in our society?  Too many people ignore or disregard this long held tradition.  As the popularity of NASCAR increases, traditional values decline.
Its not just Nascar. It is society in general. Parents grew lazy and uncaring. They wanted others to teach protocols to their children without teaching them morals. It is just too much effort to spend quality time with children when giving them a $20 is much easier.\n \nThis also falls under the statutes of Liberalism. That mentality, as I have explained several times, is, ""Whats in it for me?"" Liberals seem to think that ""EVERYTHING"" is owed to them and they have to pay for nothing. Liberals seem to think they can go into a restuarant and do as they please, offend anyone they please, and be allowed to get away with it. And this is fine with them provided no one is allowed to offend them.\n \nDerekledoux, it appears to me that you are the one that needs to get friends, learn some manners and protocol. The guy asked a question and explained his reason for asking it. He singled out Nascar (obviously your passion) get over it. They are often called ball caps, would that have offended you as well?

Some universities in the US have claimed to cause human female eggs to under go this process, if such is the case and a female egg is developed into adult hood is such a being still considered human?
I doubt a woman can give birth through parthenogenesis. It would require significant genetic manipulation which is a form of mutancy in itself. \n\nThe child I think will have an exact replica genetic material as the mother which is human but inhuman in its moral consequences. HOWEVER! The child would be missing half the chromosones needed to create what we deem human. This would have significant mental or physical defects I believe  which would make it not completely human."

"Please Help me solve this relativity problem?
Suppose that there is only two point masses in the universe. They are positioned far from each other at rest and at distance d and are identical. How much does it take two masses to meet together?\nWhat is the relative velocity when they meet?\nDon’t make any extra simplification on problem.
Your experimental model is corrupt in terms of current known information about matter and energy in a space-time continuum.  No prediction or calculation can be applied.\nWith two point masses, the only force in the system would be do to gravity.  This is an assumption based upon multiple moving masses in what we would call the normal physical universe.\nIf the distance between their centers (d) was sufficiently small, the points would be touching one another and no force would be exerted on the masses.  If the distance was sufficiently large, then it is possible that the force would be so small that the masses would not move.  Only in a finite range of distances would any gravity possibly exist.\nOne can make no assumptions about G as a gravitational constant, since G assumes that one of the masses is the earth.  One would need additional information about the masses to solve the problem."

"how do you get rid of blackheads?
i have a ton of blackheads on my face and i want my face to be more clear....what should i do?
The key to skin care for acne is consistency. An overnight cure has not been found. But using good skin care methods aids in the daily, steady improvement of follicle health. Since acne is not caused by eating certain foods, restricting the diet is not helpful. Since it is also not caused by ""dirty"" skin, excessively scrubbing does not help and can even make the skin more irritated. The best skin care for comedones consists of once-a-day cleansing with a mild soap or facial scrub to aid in the removal of excess sebum and dead skin cells. Oil-based makeup should not be used since these can contribute to the buildup of oil in the follicles. Water-based makeup labeled as non-comedogenic can be used safely."

"what can you eat after you have had bariatric surgery?
suggested meals after rouen x bariatric surgery
Understanding Bariatric Surgery Diet\n\nSurgery will help you lose weight, of course. You'll lose plenty of excess weight during the first year after your operation. But you'll have to change your eating and exercise patterns to ensure that weight stays off. And you'll need to alter your eating anyway to prevent pain and vomiting, protect your surgical procedure (e.g., staple line), and prevent food from blocking the opening from the stomach to the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHere are the guidelines for your new way of eating.  Eat slowly and chew foods until they are mushy.\n\n    * Allow 30 - 60 minutes for each meal\n    * Aim for 30 chews for each bite, chewing thoroughly to mush\n    * Explain to people why you must eat slowly\n    * Take small bites. Try a baby spoon. Cut food in the size of a ""pea"" to make it easier to chew\n    * Savor each bite, noting its taste, flavor, and texture\n    * Sit down and be focused on eating, not other activities where you can become distracted\n\nStop eating as soon as you feel full.\n\nIf you eat too much you'll get sick. Because the amount of space in your stomach is so small, do not eat and drink at the same time.\n\nAt first, you'll only be able to eat 1/4 cup of solid food (2 to 3 tablespoons of each item on your plate). Over time, the amount of food your stomach can hold will increase from 1/2 to 1 cup per meal. Your new, tiny stomach will not hold more than 1 cup of food at a time.\n\nHow to tell when you've had enough?\n\n    * Pressure or fullness in the center below your rib cage\n    * Nausea\n    * Pain in your shoulder or upper chest\n\nWhen you get the feeling of fullness, stop eating, even if you have not finished your meal.  Set aside three meals a day when you only eat solid foods.\n\nThis will help you eat nutritious meals rather than endless snacking. Snacking could prevent you from losing weight. It could even cause you to gain weight.  Sip slowly in between meals all day.\n\n    * We all need liquids to stay hydrated. We suggest you drink water, skim, low fat or soy milk (up to 24 ounces per day), low calorie beverages, or tea.\n\n    * Don't drink anything for 30 minutes before or after each meal. Your stomach isn't big enough for both food and liquids!\n\n    * Sip beverages slowly. Carry a bottle of water at all times.\n\n    * Avoid high calorie drinks like milkshakes, soda, fruit juices/fruit drinks, beer, alcohol, meal substitutes. They can sabotage your weight loss efforts by adding calories without making you feel full.\n\n    * Avoid carbonated beverages. They can cause bloating.\n    \n    *  Eat a balanced diet\n\nYou're not going to be eating much, so what you eat needs to be high quality and packed with nutrients—the biggest nutritional bang for the calories. You'll also need to take a multivitamin every day to make up for the nutrients no longer being absorbed in the bypassed areas of your stomach and intestines. Your long-term diet will be low in fat and sugar and high in protein.\n\nWhat happens if I don't follow the diet?\n\nWeight loss surgery is successful 80% of the time. The number one reason it fails the other 20% of the time: not following the post-surgery diet. You must be disciplined and committed to sticking to the program. That includes changing eating behaviors and exercise habits.\n\nIf this feels overwhelming to you, turn to a support group for strength."

"were white people slaves before black people?

All races have had theier periods of slavery. Many American Whites came here as slaves. They were pulled from debter's prisons or came here as endenured servents. Not quite the same as African's who came to America but pretty close. The British until the war of 1812 swiped Americn sailors and impressed them. That is enslaved them forcing them to sail as British sailors.  Some native tribes in America kept slaves. Many native tribes in South America did so. In Aftrica is was and even today continues to be an institution. In the middle east slavery was common until recent times. In Asia it was also common until the last 500 years. However the Japanese reinstituted it heavily during WWII. In Europe Jews, Catholics, Intellectuals, Communists were enslaved and some sent to concentration camps. \n\nSo slavery has a long sordid role in human history.

Whereas the GSR was traditionally used to teach relaxation it was overlooked as a tool to teach relaxed concentration being dwarfed by the popular and successful neurofeedback. \n\nMeasuring electron flow in a circuit the body operates largely by a series of electrical impulses which have been shown to follow certain pathways and measure changes in the electrical resistance or the ability of the tissue to conduct electricity. The GSR activity marker is positive in the majority of ADD clients tested. Once tested, then the GSR biofeedback may be used to improve the stress result with different techniques. A protocol using this valid objective physiological marker has just been published in a video- ""Guide for GSR Biofeedback Techniques for the Natural ADHD Practitioner"" (Amazon.com). \n\nUsing the GSR protocol only takes 10 minutes to perform. The test is valid for children as well as adults and helps parents determine if their ADHD children need intervention. The measure may then be used to match a personal technique protocol to the client depending on what type of technique helps improve the GSR from lability to stability during rest. \n\nThe GSR is measured as labile and steadily increases in amplitude when the ADHD child tries to sit quietly for 2 minutes. The GSR is then increasingly more labile during an eyes closed condition. This is in contrast to the GSR in anxiety where there is usually a decrease during a relaxing eyes closed baseline condition. In some instances- the GSR in ADHD is stable - however, will not return to baseline after prompted with a mild stimulus like noise. This shows that a symptom of ADHD when trying to sit quietly and concentrate -is acting like a stress-or for him her. This is not unlike the ""disorientation"" experienced in dyslexics when trying to read. \n\nMany ADHD clients- upon producing a stable GSR after a biofeedback assisted relaxed concentration technique - will claim when asked-that this is the first time ever they felt what relaxation /concentration is. This may be compared to someone not having ever tasted a tasty food like an orange. You can't describe it to them. However, once they taste it- they know what it feels like. So too, it turns out, with the sense of relaxation, focus in ADHD. When asked to compare this sensation with the sensation of an ADHD medication- the majority of ADHD people will say that the natural biofeedback induced sensation is better than medication- and medication does not ""feel well"" even though it does help them concentrate. This shows that medication like Ritalin has a different mode of action working to help ADHD than natural and behavioral methods. \nThe relaxation and relaxed concentration response is natural and seems to be lacking in many people with ADHD. These responses might have been lacking at birth or were compromised with an unbalancing childhood medical problem (Ears nose and throat, asthma,-sleep disorder-medical operation). However, once re-learned or acquired - the ADHD person can re-produce this \n""sensation"" upon need. Like learning art or music- some are born with it- but all can learn to be artists or musicians with the proper instruction. This objective physiological test is easy to replicate only with the most sensitive /graphic GSR biofeedback equipment."
"What percentage of aspirin tablets is acetylsalicylic acid?

Kind of depends on the Aspirin tablet. If it is coated or bufferend, it will have less. But generally, the percentage that is acetylsalicylic acid is quite high. Other ingredients may include corn starch and cellulose.\n\nSorry. I don't have the actual percentage. However, if you have an accurate (and precise) scale, weigh a 325mg pill and calculate the percentage."

"How does one leave Scientology when they are a staff member ?
I live with someone who is a staff member.  This person wants to leave but still wants to be a Scientologist. They want to do the right thing by this organisation but improve on their life as well. Yet the organisation is preventing them from leaving with BS courses to try and change their mind (we will call this delay tatics), insinuating they are following down the path of a suppressive person (lets call this threats) and not providing a routing form which is something required to find out how to leave. So far my friend has been trying for 4 months to leave.  So you all have a clear picture.  My friend is leaving because Scientology is mostly volunteer and believe it or not people need money to live in this world. As a staff member who isn't paid  you sign a contract which dosen't begin till you finish your training. But in this person case training hasn't finished even after 4 years being a staff member.  Constructive answers appreciated,not interested in people trashing Scientology
Hi there,\nI can help you with this. I am a Scientologist myself and also have been a Church member of staff.\nThere is a standard routing form which your friend's organisation\nshould be providing. The fact that who ever your friend is dealing with\nhas not provided it is totally against Church policy , since if he needs or wants to leave staff, he should not be prevented from doing so, or made to feel wrong in any way.\nI suggest that your friend write an Ethics Report on who ever is responsible for this problem and make sure he sends a copy to this persons senior, or as high up the Church channels as he needs to go to get this quickly resolved.\nThe policy reference for how to write this report and correctly route it is: HCO Policy Letter 1st May 1965 "" Staff Member Reports""\nYour friend should read this reference which will be found in the Basic Staff Hat  OEC Volume 0. Pick which ever  type of report applies and then write up the situation fully and route the various copies as instructed on the communication channels that should be in place in the organisation.\nIf there is still no quick resolution, and he then leaves on his own determinism. ( which is in fact his basic right anyway)\nThis report will be on file for his future defence, should he need it.\nI advise him to make an additional copy for himself and keep it, incase\nhis report does not make it into his own staff ethics file."
"What changes should you look for after a lupron injection?

I was on this for 3 months (couldn't make it the 6 months) and had numerous problems.  Some people have little to no issues while others experience a lot.  Below is what happened to me.\n\n1. Continous migraine-like headaches.\n2. Dry heaves after eating anything.  It was very diffult to keep food down.  I lost 16 lbs in 3 months.\n3. This one's obvious - hot flashes and night sweats.\n4. Anxiety.  I felt like I needed to crawl out of my skin sometimes.\n5. Heart palpitations.\n6. I would get a fluttering that started near my heart and then expanded out just a few seconds before a hot flash.  It was really weird.\n7. Memory loss and difficulty concentrating.\n\nThese were the main issues I had.\n\nI was on this for endometriosis.  It stopped my periods but there was still some pain.  The side effects were so bad though that my doctor put me on hormones which caused the period to start back up!!!  Anyway, based on my experience I wouldn't recommend this as a first drug of choice.  There may be better options.\n\nThe other GnRH agonists similar to Lupron are Zolodex and Synarel.  Synarel is a nasal spray and Zolodex is a subcutaneous implant.  My doctor said that Zolodex is painful and he didn't recommend it.  Synarel may be a good option because if there are lots of problems you can stop taking it.  You can't squeeze out the injection if you have problems.\n\nGood luck."
"Give a tip for alcohol?
My cousin told me that when you get your bill you should deduct the alcoholic beverage portion before calculating the tip. Is this customary?? If it is, do you know why?
I have never heard of this.  Often the drinks are the most expensive part of the bill... and they require the wait staff to run back and forth from the table to the bar.  So I would always include the drinks when I am figuring out the tip."
"Which religion (if any) is the truth?
Please provide evidence as to why you think so. Is there anything that supports your particular religion not being based on man-made ideas or previous religions?
A lot of religions share similar themes. Most have taken ideas from past religions and sort of reformed them.  It can be confusing with so many religions out there.  I take a anthropological mostly agnostic view on religion.  I know there is something, but who knows what, and who knows which religion is the one to follow."
"im 23 2 kids n married is there a chance of gettin my life back?

NO there isn't a way to get your life back because now you need to keep your kids' welfare in mind for every single decision.  BUT that doesn't mean you cannot still enjoy yourself.  A lot of it is getting your priorities in order and making decisions WITHOUT worrying about what other people think.  Of course, that's as long as your marriage is going well and your kids are healthy, happy, and safe.  If you are the type that doesn't mind leaving your kids with a sitter/caregiver so you can go shop, work, get your nails done, hang at the beach, party - whatever - then find someone you trust and do it.  If leaving your kids with someone while you go somewhere makes you feel rather guilty or just not right, then don't do it.\n\nYOU decided what your life will be like, to heck with critics.  If you are taking care of yourself, your husband. AND your kids, then you have got things going well.\n\nI have 3 kids and I am married.  I admit I chose to give up a lot to stay at home with the younger 2 b/c we can't afford for me to go back to work!  But I did keep my volleyball playing - which I NEVER intended to give up.  People tell me all the time I should be home with my kids instead of v-balling and others tell me I should go back to work b/c that's what should be done.\n\nAs long as you remember you're a mom and do not go overboard, you should be fine and happy.  Good luck!"
"How do I go about starting a community service project?
I want to do something for my community and I'm not really sure how to go about it. My question is basically for those who have volunteered for a cause and know how it's constructed. What I want to do is plant some trees in an area. I want to get local nursuries and businesses to sponser it. Do I go through a non-profit agency or would it be easier to conduct it myself? Are there any agencies for this kind of thing in the Florida panhandle?
It's easy either way, but I would say handle it all yourself.  That way you can say that it was your idea and your planning instead of someone else's.  \n\nGo to your town council, meet with them and ask permission first of all.  Especially about planting trees.  Get with other people in your community for support and help if you need it.  Go around in local businesses and explain what you are trying to do an ask if they will sponsor you.  If not you can talk with the town council, the county seat, or even the state about helping out with the project."
"Is this considered cheating?
If i have a girlfriend, and then i go and do somthing with a guy is that cheatin with her, or is he like another person to go out with so i can have two?
You have to keep in mind that ""cheating"" is defined by the people involved. A better question would be ""does she consider it cheating?"" or ""Based on what I have told her regarding the status of our relationship (whether or not we are exclusive, or exclusive to the sex of the person - no more than 1 gf or 1 bf, or whatever you all have discussed) would she consider it cheating?"" She may or may not. She is who you should be asking, only she can decide. By definition monogamy is one person, not one person - per sex. So if she feels you are in a monogamous relationship, you may need to redefine what your relationship is. Your relationship, both of you could decide, is really where you all do whatever you want with guys however are faithful to each other. It is, what you both can agree that it is. Honesty is always the best policy."
"Billard Ball Question HELP ASAP?
A billiard ball is moving in the x-direction at 30.0 cm/s and strikes another identical billiard ball moving in the y-direction at 40.0 cm/s. As a result of the collision, the first ball moves at 50.0 cm/s, and the second ball stops. In what final direction does the first ball move?
inverse tangent of ( y / x ) = atan(40/30) = 53.13 degrees from the horizontal.\n\nEdit: the answer is not the y-direction because if it is, then the original momentum in the x-direction would have disappeared from the system."

"Has anyone tried l.a. weight loss because I want to know if it works as well as it has been advertised to be?

I did it and man, is it expensive.  The commercials are misleading. It is not just $5 a week or 7 or whatever they are trying to sell you at the time.  The end of the year is $3 a week.\nYeah, right.  Wait til they sit you down and tell you all the other fees. And you have to purchase a program at that time and pay up front!  And the bars they push on you are so so expensive and their supplements. So be prepared!!!  I lost at first and then got discouraged by all the money.  I ended up leaving the program.  You can do that if it isn't working out.  They keep a certain amount, which they tell you about the first visit, then for the weeks you didn't use up yet and any bars you might want to a refund for. (Yes, they get you to buy a certain amount , hundreds of dollars worth, of bars up front, or you pay full price-like $14.99 a box each time you need a box. It's one box a week you ""need"".)\nThe plan is decent.  According to your weight, you get a certain color plan .  Drink lots of water and there is food on the plan.

"What is the best way to help diabetic neuropathy, other than watching your blood sugar levels?
I have been a diabetic for 32 years, and I just have been told I have diabetic neuropathy in my legs.   Does anyone know any  good exercises, lotions etc that will help, besides some meds from the doctor?
Diabetic neuropathy is not curable.  Of course the primary med prescribed is neurontin.  However, it is often thought that over the counter vitamin b-12 and vitamin e benefit the nerves.  Wear good socks and shoes...check your feet often and keep them lotioned with any unscented lotion (just make sure alcohol is not in the first few ingredients listed as alcohol is a drying agent).  It's also a great idea to see a podiatrist for any nail cutting.  One small wound, cut or nik can cost you your foot as neuropathy consists of numbness and tingling of the foot and you could have a sore there but not feel it.  As far as exercises that help...haven't heard much out there that benefits neuropathy..but exercise in general is a good idea to promote blood circulation as circulation is decreased in diabetics.  Hope this has helped you somewhat.  Best wishes."

"Chest/abdomen pain in female teenager?
Last year sometime I started having these really quick, but really sharp heart pains.  The started out very rarely and became more frequent.  I had an EKG, and everything was finally.  Gradually, they went away.  Lately however, they've been coming back again.  I'm not sure if it was like this last time, but I've noticed that when I start to feel them, the deeper I breathe in, the more it hurts.  Today and yesterday I've been feeling some pain on both sides of my chest, but they aren't as sharp, nor as quick as the ones before.  Also, the deeper I breathe in, the more they hurt. I guess the closest thing I could compare it to would be after you run for a while, and before and asthmatic takes their inhaler. (I also have asthma, but I'm pretty sure that isn’t connected. (It hurts just on the inside of my ribcage just under my breasts, and partially toward my sides).\n\nMy question is should I get another EKG just to be safe? It seems sort of pointless to me since the last one turned out just fine, and I don't really think it's my heart since the right part of my chest has been hurting as well.  Also, the pain is starting to feel…different than it did last time.\n\nKeep in mind that I’m only 15.  I also am a tad bit overweight if that affects anything. (I’m 5’4” tall, and about 145-155lbs). I know some of you are going to tell me to see a doctor, but I personally think my doctor’s a quack, and I don’t really trust what he says. \n\nI’m just looking to see if any of you have had any past experiences like this or anything.  I mean it’s not like I’m going to die in agony on anything like that, but it gets in the way.
well chest pain regardless of age sex you should really see a doctor. \n you mentioned asthma and said you didnt think that was the cause . i say dont rule it out . when asthma is flarring up muscles that dont normally work at making the lungs go kick in so we call then auxiarly muscles. the pain and place you mention is just the right place for the aux. muscles to be working . \n you might have a silent weez that is a big deal dont panic but it is sighted as the main cause of asthma deaths for people that have medication for asthma. \n if you have this you have a swelling on the inside of the chest tubes and not on the outside. the ventolin puffer often now called a resuce inhaler treats the asthma only in part . it does not treat the swelling of the tubes. after a time without additional drugs most often a steriod med the tubes just fail and the person often will die from this . \n so even though you dont hear a weez dont think asthma is not in play infact without complete treatment of asthma and just the use of ventolin asthma is very deadly. this was noted after ventolin first became so widely used . all of a sudden asthma deaths shot way up. its only in the last 5 years or so that doctors  have become fully aware of the silent weez . \n what ever the case is if this does not go away now then see the doctor and if it gets worse or your using more of the puffer then you normally do go to the emergency room and skip waiting for an appointment. \n good luck and try to relax"
"Need health insurance now have a medical condition please help?

If you are already ill, health insurance will be more expensive. Although that might not be true if you have not yet been treated for your medical condition. If you’re interested in health insurance, you should probably talk with local health insurance agents (link below). Here are a few quick thoughts. I’ve included links in the “Sources” section for each number.\n\n1.Free clinics or county health departments. You might have to pay, but it will be much less than if you go to the emergency room.\n2.Medicaid\n3.Organizations that sponsor people with your condition. I’ve linked below to Needy Meds. Just look up your condition and see if they have links to support groups.\n4.Health insurance through work: if you have been insured within the last two months on a group health plan, such as one through work, then a new group health plan would have to accept you even with your medical condition.

I am a 37 year old male who is an insulin dependent type 2 diabetic. I am also taking lithium and abilify for bipolar disorder. I had a severe heart attack last November 4th 2005 and a 6-way bypass open heart surgery on November the 9th. After the Heart attack I lost 30 percent of my Heart Muscle's ejection factor
Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor\n\nFirst of all the bipolar disorder should have no impact on your lifespan, unless you get suicidal.\n\nThe only thing that would concern me is being diabetic, since it effects so many parts of your body. Having Heart bypass surgery only prolongs your lifespan. My grandmother had a triple bypass and lived to just shy of 90.\n\nWith the advances in medicine, I'd say your chances of being alive ten years from now are rather good.\n\nThat said, healthy or not, live everyday like it's your last."

Rebuke the spirits that are coming against you in the name of JESUS CHRIST.  We are told that we have been given power to do such, and many times the only reason we are tormented is because we don't stand on what the WORD says.\nWe are not to rejoice in that power, but to rejoice that our names are written in heaven.\n\nyou are in my prayers, but also know that you have authority in the name of JESUS CHRIST."
"need help on this physics problem?
An 85.0 kg astronaut is working on the engines of a spaceship that is drifting  through space with a constant velocity.  The astronaut turns away to look at Earth and secons later is 30.0m behind the ship, at rest relative to the spaceship.  The only way to return to the ship without  a thruster is to throw a .0500kg wrench directly away from the ship.  If the astronaut throws the wrench with a speed of 20.0m/s, how long does it take the astronaut to reach the ship?
Apply conservation of momentum. MV + mv = 0. Initial momentum is 0, call M the mass of the astronaut, V his velocity, m the mass of the wrench, v the velocity of the wrench, all after the throw. Now we know the wrench is thrown in the exact opposite direction, so we can say v is negative making the formula: MV - mv = 0. Now rearrange to get V = mv / M and put in the numbers to get V = (0.5*20) / 85 = ~0.118m/s. So he is moving at a constant velocity of 0.118m/s and needs to travel 30m. To find the time just divide the distance by the speed:\n\n30/0.118 = 254 seconds."

"I need health insurance. I need INFO about Medicaid please?
Hey im a college student and I dont have health insurance. I used to have one from my parents but the health insurance company took me out of custody because im old enough. By the way, my college dont support health insurane, only BS offers. I need a real one.  I heard about Medicaid, I think thats a health insurance. Please I need info.
You probably don’t fulfill the age requirement in your state for Medicaid, especially if you are a dependent and your parents have their own health insurance. Here are few ideas (links are in Sources section):\n\n1.Check again with your college. Even if they don’t have a student health plan for all full-time students (and they really should), they should be able to point you in a good direction.\n2.Your parents: If you can’t afford $65 a month for health insurance, ask your folks. Insurance companies are targeting people in your situation with plans with low monthly premiums, high deductibles. Tonik, by Blue Cross Blue Shield, for example, has rates typically lower than $100 a month with several doctor visits a year, vision, and dental coverage.\n3.Medicaid: Like I said, you probably don’t qualify, but you can check it out by calling your state Medicaid office.\n4.Call your state insurance department. They might have state-sponsored insurance for residents. Again, unless you are already disabled or severely ill, you may not qualify.\n5.Local state-licensed health insurance agents. They’ve helped people like you before and should be able to quickly tell you what to expect from getting insurance on your own (link below).\n\nGood luck. Hope this helps.\nBarnes@MostChoice"

"how are non current assets depreciated?
This is an accounting question
Goodwill is no longer depreciated or more appropriately, amortized.  Non-current assets can be depreciated in any manner that accurately models the recovery of the cash flows.  The most common methods are straight line, X% declining balance, and units of production.  If your question is ""how,"" then you need to look up the methods.  If you meant ""why,"" it is to model recovery of the cash flows.  It isn't to model decay.  If the object breaks or becomes obsolete, then you write it down.  Certain non-current assets, such as raw land, are not depreciated.  Likewise, certain assets, such as minerals are depleted rather than depreciated, although it amounts to the same thing in practice.\n\nGoodwill is now the fly in the ointment.  It is tested annually for value and can be writtend own as necessary."
"what is MAT tax ? where it is applied? where will the sensex market go?

You have asked two different questions:\nA) What is mat? Well MAt means Minimum Alternate Tax. The provision is applied on Companies. It says that even if a company may not have taxable income under I T Act , it still have to pay tax on the profit computed in prescribed manner if the company has profit under companies Act. The tax has to be paid at the rate of 10% now (7.5% )on Book Profit.\n    You should also understand why this MAT came into being. Reliance Industries is a very good example. In late nineties, RIL was having huge profits even then it was not paying taxes because the total income computed under I T Act was always a loss. That was because of high Depreciation on plants and machinery on ongoing projects.\n    So that became a too; in many a profitable companies to lower the taxes. The govt then brought MAT.\n\nB) As far as the Sensex rise is concerned, only God knows where will it go. But as the market and world thinks, it will go higher and higher."

"can women with polycystic syndrome develop cancer in the long term?

Women with PCOS can be at an increased risk for developing several other conditions. Irregular menstrual periods and the absence of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not the hormone progesterone. Without progesterone, which causes the endometrium to shed each month as a menstrual period, the endometrium becomes thick, which can cause heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding. Eventually, this can lead to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Women with PCOS are also at higher risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Getting the symptoms under control at an earlier age may help to reduce this risk."

"Who can tell me more about vampires!?!?
I would like to know all kind of informations about Vampires!!!!!
Vampires are mythical or folkloric creatures, typically held to be the re-animated corpses of human beings and said to subsist on human and/or animal blood (hematophagy), often having supernatural powers, heightened senses and physical abilities, and/or the ability to physically transform. Some cultures have myths of non-human vampires, such as demons or animals like bats, dogs, and spiders. Vampires are often described as having a variety of additional powers and character traits, extremely variable in different traditions, and are a frequent subject of folklore, cinema, and contemporary fiction.\n\nVampirism is the practice of drinking blood from a person/animal. Vampires are said to mainly bite the victim's neck, extracting the blood from the carotid artery. In folklore and popular culture, the term generally refers to a belief that one can gain supernatural powers by drinking human blood. The historical practice of vampirism can generally be considered a more specific and less commonly occurring form of cannibalism. The consumption of another's blood (and/or flesh) has been used as a tactic of psychological warfare intended to terrorize the enemy, and it can be used to reflect various spiritual beliefs.\n\nIn zoology and botany, the term vampirism is used to refer to leeches, mosquitos, mistletoe, vampire bats, and other organisms that prey upon the bodily fluids of other creatures. This term also applies to mythic animals of the same nature, including the chupacabra.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nEnglish vampire comes from German Vampir, in turn from early Old Polish *vąper' (where ą is a nasal a, and both p and r' are palatalized), in turn from Old Slavic *oper (with a nasal o) or Old Church Slavonic opiri. It is similar to Serbian verb piriti, ""to swell"", and to Greek apyros, ""not undergone by fire"". The Slavic word, like its cognate netopyr' (""bat""), comes from the PIE root for ""to fly"". The word Upir as a term for vampire is found for the first time in written form in 1047 in a letter to a Novgorodian prince referring to him as 'Upir Lichyj' (Wicked Vampire).\n\n\nVampires in ancient cultures\n\nTales of the dead craving blood are ancient in nearly every culture around the world. Vampire-like spirits called the Lilu are mentioned in early Babylonian demonology, and the bloodsucking Akhkharu even earlier in the Sumerian mythology. These female demons were said to roam during the hours of darkness, hunting and killing newborn babies and pregnant women. One of these demons, named Lilitu, was later adapted into Jewish demonology as Lilith. Lilitu/Lilith is sometimes called the mother of all vampires. For further information, see the article on Lilith.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptian goddess Sekhmet in one myth became full of bloodlust after slaughtering humans and was only sated after drinking alcohol colored as blood.\n\nIn Homer's Odyssey, the shades that Odysseus meets on his journey to the underworld are lured to the blood of freshly sacrificed rams, a fact that Odysseus uses to his advantage to summon the shade of Tiresias. Roman tales describe the strix, a nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Roman strix is the source of the Romanian vampire, the Strigoi and the Albanian Shtriga, which also show Slavic influence.\n\nIn early Slavic folklore, a vampire drank blood, was afraid of (but could not be killed by) silver and could be destroyed by cutting off its head and putting it between the corpse's legs or by putting a wooden stake into its heart.\n\nMedieval historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded the earliest English stories of vampires in the 12th century.\n\nMany vampire legends also bear similarities to legends regarding succubi or incubi.\n\n\nFolk beliefs in vampires\n\nIt seems that until the 19th century, vampires in Europe were thought to be hideous monsters from the grave. They were usually believed to ri"

"how does caffeine wake up your brain?

As adenosine is created in the brain, it binds to adenosine receptors. The binding of adenosine causes drowsiness by slowing down nerve cell activity. In the brain, adenosine binding also causes blood vessels to dilate (presumably to let more oxygen in during sleep).\n\nTo a nerve cell, caffeine looks like adenosine. Caffeine therefore binds to the adenosine receptor. However, it doesn't slow down the cell's activity like adenosine would. So the cell cannot ""see"" adenosine anymore because caffeine is taking up all the receptors adenosine binds to. So instead of slowing down because of the adenosine level, the cells speed up. You can see that caffeine also causes the brain's blood vessels to constrict, because it blocks adenosine's ability to open them up. This effect is why some headache medicines like Anacin contain caffeine -- if you have a vascular headache, the caffeine will close down the blood vessels and relieve it.\n\nSo now you have increased neuron firing in the brain. The pituitary gland sees all of the activity and thinks some sort of emergency must be occurring, so it releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline (epinephrine)."

"what is the chemical in bees stings?

(m)\n\nStingers are effective weapons because they deliver a venom that causes pain when injected into the skin. The major chemical responsible for the pain of a honey bee sting is called melittin; it stimulates the nerve endings of pain receptors in the skin. The result is a very painful sensation, which begins as a sharp pain that lasts a few minutes and then becomes a dull ache. Even up to a few days later, the tissue may still be sensitive to the touch."

Seattle has outdoor activities, music, theatre, art, sports, education, lectures, museums, and lots of great places to eat many kinds of food."
"how do i treat a burn on the roof of my mouth? (it's been hurting for about a week now)?

Sounds like a pizza cheese burn or you ate something microwaved. Oh yeah I totally agree about going to the doctor if it's been a week. From my experience wounds inside the mouth, even burns, should heal very quickly. Perhaps you've got an infection? (OMG Nicole, you cracked me up! I hope your mouth feels better soon - I'm sure it will - that's not too serious)"
"does magnetic field affect light?

""Can light be bent by electromagnetic (EM) fields? The short answer is\nno, “but” with an explanation.\n\nEM fields bend the path of moving particles such as in the Solar Wind,\nor simply in a TV tube which uses EM fields to deflect (bend) electron\npaths.\n\nSince light is both a wave and a particle at the same time, you might\nthink that this would cause light to be bent if only you had a strong\nenough field.\n\nAfter all, light is bent by gravity, so what’s the difference?\n\nThe reason EM fields can bend the path of many particles is because\nthose particles are carrying an electrical charge – the EM field is\nactually affecting the charge associated with the particle.\n\nPhotons (light) have spin (1) but do not have an electrical charge so\nthey aren’t affected by even very strong magnetic fields."" to read more click on the link below \nhttp://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=430345\nall credits to siliconsamurai-ga at GAnswers\n\nResources dug up by me - \nhttp://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/kids_space/qphy_grav.html\nhttp://www.nobeliefs.com/light.htm"

I am using charles's law and just need to have it told to me in laymens terms. \nI think my head has stoped workng :)\nThanks for the help, I just need help with the steps I can find the answer if I have all the steps.
V1T2 = V2T1\n147mL * (57+273K) = V2 * (28 + 273K)\nV2 = (147mL * 330K)/ 301K\nV2 = 161mL\n\nTherefore, volume at 57C is 161mL. Its logical since when temperature rises, volume increases."
"physics problem .... I need help please ?
a U-shaped tube containing a quantity of mercury of density 13600 kg/m3 . water of density 1000 kg/m3 is poured in one branch of the tube , then oil of density 800 kg/m3 is poured over the water .. the height of each of the water and oil columns is 50 cm ..\n\na) find the height of mercury in the other branch over the interface .\n\nb) find the height of water to be poured on the surface of mercury so that its surface in the two branches becomes the same level ...\n\nI really need help with that ... thanks.
The weights of the liquids inside 2 branches must be equal, therefore:\n\na) m_water + m_oil = m_mercury (the amount of mercury that raised in the other branch to keep the balance)\n\nm_water = D_water * V_water = D_water * h_water * Area\nm_oil = D_oil * V_oil = D_oil * h_oil * Area\nm_mercury = D_mercury * V_mercury = D_mercury * h_mercury * Area\n\nSubstitute this in the balance of weights above, we have\nD_water * h_water * Area + D_oil * h_oil * Area  = D_mercury * h_mercury * Area\n<-> h_mercury = (D_water * h_water + D_oil * h_oil) / D_mercury\n\nb) To bring mercury's surface two the same level again, the weight of the to-be-added water must be the same with the weight of both oil and water in the other branch.\n\nYou can do the same as above to find:\nh_water2 = (D_water * h_water + D_oil * h_oil) / D_water"
"Where are most Cinder Cone Volcanoes usually located?

Cinder Cones build up when tephra erupts from a vent and falls back to earth around the vent.  The accumulated tephra, which are cinders, forms a cone-shaped mountain.  Paricutin, in western Mexico is well known for its cinder cone.  It began in 1943, when a crack opened in the ground of a cornfield.  When the eruptions ended in 1952, the top of the cone had grown to 1,345 feet (410 meters) above its abase."
"why does lipid peroxidation take place in our body and what impact does it have on causing cancer.?

Oxidants (oxidative stress) can cause lipid peroxidation.  Oxidative stress is a natural byproduct of the use of oxygen by biological systems.  It is also caused by various biological processes such as inflammation, immune reactions, and detoxification processes.  Unsaturated fattys acids (especially in cell membranes) are very susceptible to damage by oxidative stress.  This damage results in lipid peroxidation (literally - 'fat oxidation').  Antioxidants (especially vitamin E) work to prevent excessive levels of oxidative stress in cell membranes and therefore, help prevent lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxides can lead to damage to DNA.  DNA damage can contribute to the risk of developing various cancers."
"why should distilled water be used when making chemical tests?

Water from the tap has several ions in it.  Some are added by people (like fluorine) and some arent (like sodium).  Also, water from the tap has several impurities.  \n\nWhen water is distilled, it is purified.  This water is deionized (some people call it DI water).  The water is free of impurities.  Without impurities, chemical ""tests"" can be run very efficiently and effectively with water."
"as a single mom and college student how can i earn extra money?
i'm a single mom that's in college. i work for a cell phone company but the thing is i only get paid $6 a hour. i like my job because of the flexibility, but the pay is horrible when there is rent to pay and other bills. so what can i do to earn an extra income.
I am trying to think of something to do as well because i'm in the same boat. I have sold food on the weekends. Funny I know, but its an extra couple hundred in my pocket. I think maybe you could try some work at home. Maybe even start off little, if you can bake, make some goods and start selling that or other kind of crafts you can make. I know that may be timely but think of taking a weekend off of school and work and cleaning out old household items and having a yard sale. I know these may seem like chump change but its money. Another thing is to try and look for jobs that pay you a good wage and help you even pay for college. I know that when I worked at Bank of America, they even paid for your schooling. I think the best solution is to change jobs. There are alot of jobs now that offer programs for people who need a job and also want to continue their education."

"where does the one sock of at least one pair of socks, per load of laundry go?

From what I remember, one sock in every wash absorbs so much heat that the sock molecules actually lose their bonds, and the sock becomes, in fact, gaseous.  This phase phase change is similar to sublimation, in which a solid transforms directly to a gas.  Many people mistakenly use this term, sublimation, when referring to the phenomenon.  The true scientific term, though, is 'socklimation.'  \nThe now-gaseous sock particles begin circulating and mixing with the hot air in the dryer, and are expelled with the humid air through the dryer vent.  The sock particles then rise to a little-known boundary layer of the earth's atmosphere (the sockmosphere).  The sockmosphere is a protective layer of the earth's atmosphere which protects us from the harmful ""JS"", or ""Jockey-Speedo"" rays of the sun.  Unfortunately, the sockmosphere has been thinning in recent years, accounting for the resurgence of people (primarily overweight men) being affected by the harmful JS rays.\n\nHope this helps!\nMM"
"What is the safest way to propose to a girl(without getting hurt)..?

There is no safe way. If she wants to marry you, she'll say yes.  If not, then you will be hurt.  Upping the cost to her to reject you will not gain you any benefit.  For example, if you take her to a ball game and propose to her on the stadium scoreboard, she may say ""yes"" to save embarrasment.  But, then she'll dump you later and you will be even more hurt."

You apparently know what the diagonal rule looks like, but the link below gives a quite nice picture of it.\n\nBasically it is a summary of the order in which electron shells will be filled up. Follow the arrows round to discover where the electrons will go, starting at the 1s level.\n\nSo for 15:\n2 electrons will go into 1s, filling that up\n1s2\nthe next electrons will go into 2s2, 2p6, 3s2 and then the remaining 3 electrons into the 3p orbital, giving us a structure of:\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3\nRemeber, on your diagram, the first two characters (2p, 4d etc) are the names of the orbital, and the final digit is the number of electrons in that orbital. On your diagram the final digit shows the maximum number of electrons on the orbital; when you write out the structure the first few orbitals will be full (1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2) and the last one will be part full of however many electrons you have left (3p3.)"

There is really little difference except for the type of projects a statistician and a biostatistician work on.  Typically a biostatistician analyzes epidemiologic information such as clinical trials or case-control studies after an infectious disease outbreak.  However, I am a statistician (not a biostatistician) and I work on these projects as well.  A biostatistician is simply a more medically-specialized analyst.  Rarely would you see a biostatistician doing brownian calculation statistics, etc.  They usually stick to logistic regression and categorical data analysis."

The CT Scan and MRI image structure not function.  Positron Emission Tomography (PET Scan) images glucose uptake.  In 1980 we all assumed that this would 'see' exactly what you are interested in knowing but by 1995 efforts in this regard were largely abandoned.

I went to my pcp and she said it wasn't gout. I might go to ER tomorrow because it's very painful to walk and I stand on my feet all day at work.
If you haven't changed your shoes anytime recently (which might account for this discomfort) it's possible you're having an allergic reaction.  Since it seems to be localized to your instep, it's possible you've been bitten or stung by something.  Monitor the swelling, make sure it doesn't spread.  If it does, take an antihistamine (benadryl).\n\nChances are this is a bite of some kind if you haven't experienced an injury in this area.  Keep an eye on it and see the doctor, he/she may be able to give you something for it."

"Why does Chaos usually work unfavorably for humans as apposed to favorably.?
Lets say there was one room in a house in which everything was chaotic. Everything apart from the things that make it a room. Walls, floor and ceiling.

Does this room sound appealing to you? Probably not unless your Jeffrey dahmer.

"where in the holy Bible Did any getbaptist father,son & holy ghost??

After his resurrection, Jesus Christ gave flashes of light regarding an obligation resting on all his followers. Most likely it was to the 500 disciples assembled in Galilee that he said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. \n\nThereafter, all followers of Christ were to be preachers, and their preaching commission was not to be limited to “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (Matthew 10:6) Nor were they to perform John’s baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins. Instead, they were to baptize people “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.”\n\nJesus commanded his followers to baptize new disciples “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (Matthew 28:19) What did Jesus mean? Baptism “in the name of the Father” indicates that the person being baptized wholeheartedly accepts Jehovah God as the Creator and the rightful Sovereign of the universe. (Psalm 36:9; 83:18) Being baptized ‘in the name of the Son’ means that the individual acknowledges Jesus Christ—and particularly His ransom sacrifice—as the only means of salvation provided by God. (Acts 4:12) Baptism ‘in the name of the holy spirit’ signifies that the baptismal candidate recognizes Jehovah’s holy spirit, or active force, as God’s instrument for carrying out His purposes.\n\nJesus commanded, it is to be carried out “in all the nations.”  To Jesus’ Jewish followers, that must have been a startling commission. He was telling his Jewish disciples that they would now have to go out to the “unclean” Gentiles of all the nations and teach them. It took some readjusting for them to absorb the impact of and act on that assignment. (Acts 10:9-35) But there was no getting around it; Jesus had told them in a parable that “the field is the world.” \n\nWhen we examine texts offered by Trinitarians as evidence that the Bible “implies” a Trinity, what do we find? An honest appraisal reveals that the scriptures offered do not speak of Christendom’s Trinity.   \nAn example of such texts is found at Matthew 28:19, 20. There the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit are mentioned together. Some claim that this implies a Trinity. But read the verses yourself. Is there anything in those texts that says that the three are one God equal in eternity, power, position, and wisdom? No, there is not. It is the same with other texts that mention the three together."

ok, first of all u do not need dairy products, they are bad for your bones if u are no longer a child, exchange those for rice milk, and rice milk ice cream if u must: not soy milk b/c it has more cholesterol than non-fat milk.\neat lots of grains, like brown rice and grain bread with vegetables (preferably raw or slightly boiled/steamed).\nAlso, if u have access to a Japanese or Asian food market get some ""Soba noodles"" and boil them, they are delicious, and u dont need to drain the water after, u can just make it into a soup with veggies.\nAlso it would be good to get yrself addicted to sushi, preferably sashimi actually (just slices of raw fish).  So maybe u have some sushi-loving friends to help you out to make your own or maybe go out for some! :) I included a link (the 2nd one) of how to make your own sashimi, and note than u should exchange the white rice with brown rice or none at all.\nAlso:\nOmega-3 fish oil tablets to wonders for lowering bad cholesterol\nGarlic extract supplement (liquid)\nCayenne Pepper supplement (pills)\nthese are all perfectly safe and help reduce cholesterol as well as maintainng a healthy heart.\ncheck out the link below for some more cholesterol lowering foods.\nmy father has really bad cholesterol and has had 2 heart attacks in his life, but this new diet has been saving him."
"If i suspect I am anemic, should i just buy an over the counter iron supplement?
I have been anemic before, but i bleed alot during periods. ( at least for the first 3 days) I had blood taken at least 2 mnths ago(for an anxiety attack I had) The Drs. never came back and said anything was wrong, so I suspect that everything was okay. Its just that I have been having pains in my legs and ankles before I start my period(also the usual pain in the back/lower abdoemen)And a lady said maybe Im anemic, but I usually have plenty of energy.Does that matter and are there any serious complications with being anemic, I hear is the most common blood disorder. Although when Im going to ""start"", I feel tired, but isnt that normal when women are menustrating? Thanks.
My dear, please consult your doctor if you're not sure. I doubt it that you're anaemic. The symptoms that you felt before and during your periods are quite normal, really. If you're anaemic, you can usually see certain signs (for example, pallor of your palms and at the inside of your lower eyelids). You would also likely be experiencing lethargy, palpitations or worse, fainting spells.\n\nHeavy flow on the first 3 days of your periods are normal. Usually, it's consider heavy bleeding if 5 pads or more are fully soaked. \n\nPlease consult your doctor if you want further peace of mind :)"
"How does one keep from going crazy?
What is the glue that holds a person together?\n\nHow do you explain those people who have completely lost it?
Hmmm...the glue that holds a person together...would that be...crazy glue?! I would say that if you can fill your life with lots of positive activities & people, you won't have time to throw a pity party and feel sorry for yourself because you're so out of it. Those who have completely lost it maybe never had it. Or maybe they lost their focus and are too focused on themselves. If you can get involved in your community, or with a project that benefits someone or something else, you don't have the time to lose it. And when it gets down to it, everything is temporary. Holding anything so tightly that it hurts when your fingers have to be pried away from it shows that you are depending on that thing way too much to function properly. And that's what makes some people lose it, emotionally. When you consider all this, it all seems like small stuff, so why waste time going crazy? <*)))><"

Sure I am sad at many times and there are a lot of times when I think people don't love me, but I just want to see a better world someday. I think everyone has a purpose in life, for example a teacher's purpose is to teach, Mother Theresa's purpose was to help the poor, it really depends on what you find makes you and others happy. Everyone has a purpose in life, it's just that sometimes it may take longer for some people to find what their purpose is. If you have not found your purpose, keep looking, don't give up, there's a purpose out there for you. ;0)"
"I really find tough waking up in the morning :( what do I do?

I am a primary care psychologist who also interned in a sleep clinic.  Here are a few tips for good sleep hygeine that improve the quality of sleep and help people wake up feeling more rested.\n\nGet into a regular sleep schedule that you keep even on the weekends.  Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.\n\nDon't use the snooze button.  ""Snoozing"" is very poor quality sleep and only helps you feel more tired when you actually do get up.\n\nExercise is good-- not right before bed, but any other time of day works.\n\nLimit caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol as all interfere with sleep quality.  \n\nUse the bed only for sex and sleep.  No watching tv, no reading, no clipping your toenails :)  If you need some noise to help you sleep, use a fan or a white noise machine-- not the television.\n\nOne of the previous posters mentioned depression-- hypersomnia (sleeping too much) is a symptom of depression.   Here is an online depression screener that you might fill use: http://www.med.nyu.edu/psych/screens/depres.html"
"what is coefficient of skewness?
Please give the formula to calculate it and any links related to it
When working with data, skewness is the average of ((x_k-mu)/sigma)^3, where x_k are the elements of the data set, mu is the sample mean and sigma is the sample standard deviation.\n\nWhen working with random variables in probability, skewness is the mean (expected value) of ((X-mu)/sigma)^3, where X is the random variable, mu is its mean (expected value) and sigma is its standard deviation. The two definitions are analogous.\n\nThe normal distribution has skewness 0. In fact, all symmetric distributions have skewness 0. A positive skewness means that the distribution has a heavy tail to the right from the mean and it bends to the left and a negative skewness means the opposite.\n\nI'll give you a Wikipedia article although it wasn't written very well in my opinion, and I don't know if you can figure out anything from it."
"Is it ever appropriate to ask your boss if you'll be getting a bonus?
My boyfriend's company gave bonuses last year around this time, he is not sure if they will be giving out bonuses again.  Would it be tacky or ill-responsible to ask if the company will again be giving bonuses? He is quite underpaid for his job scope and is counting on the bonus to to bring his pay up to par with his responsibilities.  He has been given a whole host of new duties without a pay raise, and he is also hesitant to ask about that.....
As an employer, I would like to say that it is VERY appropriate for an employee to ask if you'll be getting a bonus.  Shame on the company for not making sure the employees know where they stand, and where the company stands as far as profitability for the year (what most bonus's are based on).\n\nAn employee should never be hesitant to discuss their income with their boss.  Bosses are human, too, and it is natural to want to know what your income is to be.  Don't be afraid to discuss future raises, or an increase in compensation for increased responsibilities.  Employers aren't dumb enough to think you work there ""just for fun.""  On the other hand, if you haven't been keeping up your part of the bargain, don't be surprised if the answer is ""sorry, no pay raises in the immediate future."""
"Would you vote for a Religion-Free world? A place with only one religion i.e.""Love, Peace and Brotherhood""?
How cool would it be to have no disputes over religion?\n\nNo hurt feelings?\n\nNo lives taken?\n\nJust peace and brotherhood (and sisterhood)?
Like communism, it sounds great IN THEORY. However, there is the small detail of how could anyone convince people that the things that they've held in such high regard their entire lives to be false. And keep in mind these aren't just theories about what COULD be to them, they are FACTS. Like gravity or mathematics, for some people belief in some higher being is just as constant and valid. But if you can think of a way for it to happen, I'm right with ya."

"Did you get the June issue of ""The Gay Agenda?""?
It's the one with Fred Phelps on the cover, and the article talks about how much good he's doing towards furthering the Gay Agenda (the concept, not the magazine) with his anti-gay rhetoric.  I'd never looked at it that way before, but basically, it says he's so vile and disturbing, he turns middle America against the ultra conservative platform he spews.\nI see what they're saying, but I can't imagine making him a grand Marshal of a pride parade.
""The Gay Agenda"" ? Have not read it nor have I ever seen it...interesting though. However, I am Gay and have been with my Partner, registered as we live in California,  for 10 years. Our agenda is to raise our 9 year old son, who is, by the way,  an honor student for all of you right wing crackpots out there,  and be a happy family. We work, do laundry, homework, take vacations, cleanhouse, spend time with Grandmas, Grandpas, cousins, Aunts and Uncles...not really exciting as far as an ""agenda"" goes. I'd say it's pretty much the same agenda a heterosexual family would have...I was raised in one you know."
"What does this verse mean to you?
Jesus said in Matthew 10:38 and 39- "" He that takes not his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of Me. He that finds his life shall lose it. and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it..
One of my favorite verses, and actually one of the two verses that I try to live my life by.  The other being ""seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all things will then be given to you"".\n\nThe verse ""he that seeks to keep his life shall lose it, but he that loses his life for my sake, shall find it"" means to me....that the more I give up my ""rights"" in life, the less I go after what I think I want for myself, the more I give up pursuing the things of the ""world"" and the more I give up my life for Jesus to do with as He pleases...the more ""myself"" I truly become.\n\nI never have felt more at peace, more my true self, then when I have given up my own will and choices and asked Jesus to guide my every step, thought, word.  Funny, isn't it?  You think by serving yourself you'd get what you want in life.  I've found by serving Him first (which means, putting others first), that's when I've found true happiness and fulfillment."
"What is freedom? Can I find it by jumping on other people's roofs?

Freedom is the liberation of captivity. It can be physical, mental, emotional, and/or many other things. For example, a good movie can captivate your attention. So captivity is not always as harmful as the word may denote. However, examples of graver captivity can be slavery or battered wives. Freedom can come from many different things, even something so little and yet so precious as a thought. After all, freedom starts as a thought."
"Very worried, need serious help.?
I cant get to a doctor for a while, but Im very worried about the inside of my mouth, it is a little red and sore right now, I did have acid reflux bad last week aswell. And on the side of my mouth, above my tonsils, down the side from where my uvula is, it looks like theres a hole? Im not sure if thats what it is, or if the skin just over laps? I just looked again.. and the skin actually does over lap, but on one side it looks like its deeper. And its kinda freaking me out, Im not sure if its infected or what? I also have bumps in the very back wall of my mouth, is that normal? or from the acid reflux?.. I took pictures of the inside of my mouth, where the ""hole"" is. And Im really looking for someone who can help me with this, maybe look at the picture and have an idea. I know that sounds retarded, but omg im scared.
I'm no Dr,,,but seems obvious you've got a throat infection.\n\nThe acid reflux certainly could have initiated rawness>inflmation,and let a ""bug"" get hold.\n\nStandard Drill is to gargle with Hydrogen Peroxide ,and then with an alcohol-based mouthwash,,such as Listerine.\nBoth are anti-septics,kill germs,etc.\n\nThings like Chloraseptic Spray or Lozenges are both pain-killing AND antiseptic.\n\nI'd suggest using all 3.\nEspecially if you've gotta wait till seeing a Dr.\n\nNo sense letting an infection Grow & spread,,and risk it becoming systemic when Peroxide & Mouthwash \nare so Effective,cheap & readily available.\n\nUsing it cannot make any condition worse.\nAnd it Might save you a trip to the Dr.\nMillions of people use it everyday for same symptoms.\n\nGood Luck!Hope it's nothing serious,and all better soon\n\n\n*** When You have acid reflux,,gargle with a Strong solution of common Baking Soda and water.\nMight have to do it a couple times.\n\nIt neutralizes the stomach acids in your throat,,,which are incredibly strong acids.\n\nYou can even swallow  a little of it,,,it's actually an old home-remedy ""antacid""."

"ive been grinding my teeth my whole life my teeth are all but gone i cant afford copays dental in what can i?

If you are eligible for medicaid, and the way your teeth are affect your ability to speak or eat, I think that having them fixed would be covered.  I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled out and medicaid covered it because they were causing my teeth to croud and become crooked.  Call your local clinic.  There is usually a clinic for low income people in most cities.  Quite possibly, if they cause you to be depressed and you can get a diagnosis of depression, insurance may cover it for that reason too... I think you should look into it."

"What is the max. mass of a neutron star?
I've heard the 1.4 solar mass number thrown around, but I thought the Chandrasekhar Limit applied to white dwarfs - electron degenerate matter - not neutron degenerate matter
It isn't an issue of  knowledge of neutron degeneracy; it depends on the degeneracy of various particle soups that result when you squish neutrons.  Different hadrons and even quarks (if you can have free quarks.) You are right in essence;  we don;t have a good enough understanding of the states of matter inside of a neutron star to understand its limit well.\n\nI remember seeing a number of 2.44 M_sun in some book on black holes I had in grad school for a class.\n\nJust now I found a couple of papers that touch on this topic (and none entirely ABOUT this topic, which probably means no one trusts their structure models well enough to make predictions). They are linked to below and both have mass estimates of observed neutron stars.  Nothing like empiricism in my mind! \n\nAnyway, doesn't look like anyone has seen one more massive than around 1.8 M_sun .  That doesn't mean they don't exist, but since a lot of these are x-ray systems (and so it isn't a matter of them being so close to their Schwarzschild radii that no light like a pulsar hotspot can escape) this could be meaningful. It could also mean more massive ones are never in short period binary systems. . . maybe to be bigger, the starting star is so darn massive that its companions are always ejected after a supernova.  Who knows."
"Who were the people that were here before Adam and Eve?
Plz dont say nobody, because if you read GOD created man during those seven days and then afterwards created adam and eve
The correct answer IS no one.  However, I understand where your confusion comes from.  In Genesis 1 we read an overview of the entire creation.  In verse 27 we see that God created man and woman, but are not given any names.  However, this doesn’t mean that they are not Adam and Eve.  The end of chapter 1 concludes the brief account, or summary if you will, of creation, and chapter 2 then elaborates on some important details.  These include how God created man and woman and their names.  Chapter 2 verse 7 describes the creation of Adam, but we know that it is an elaboration on the creation of man given in 1:27, because in 2:5 it specifically says that there was no man on the earth.  \n\nHope that clears it up a little.\n\n_______________  EDIT _______________\n\nTo James,\n\nI'm afraid you are mistaken about the meaning of the word ""man"" as it applies to Genesis 1 and 2.  I encourage you to look at the original Hebrew words as it makes it clearer that both chapters refer to the same ""man"".  It is understandable that some confusion is introduced when translating into English, so it is helpful to look at the original words to determine their meaning both individually and in the context of the surrounding scripture.  For example, the word for ""man"" is the exact same Hebrew word in both chapter 1 and 2, AND it is essentially the same word as the man's name! ADAM!  And it is a form that is used much more often as a singular form, while a different word (Alef + Yod + Shin) is used more often to indicate MEN - plural.  The word in Genesis 1 & 2 in Hebrew is Alef + Dalet + Mem.  \n\nCheck it our more for yourself -- you'll be surprised how consistent it is with the rest of the Bible's idea that Adam WAS the first man!"

"wil someone just please pray for me?  i'd like to know that today someone else is praying with me.?
I'm nowhere near perfect and sadly contend with an ongoing drug problem.  More recently though I've been sincerely alone and struggling while caring for my two toddlers. In a nut shell, I was arrested and by the time I was released without ever seeing a judge, my two boys had been separated between the paternal grandmother and my mom.  I've already flunked this part with my two older children. With all my heart I want to prove myself sincere and able without the distractions and lack of confidence in myself that I had in the past. Today I just want a prayer while I am in ACTION. Thanks.  Have a great day. I'm off to be screened and God willing, accepted into treatment. Yes, I have to believe that this miracle is possible...and at best, I'll be busy and away from where I don't need or want to be.  God Bless
You are not alone. I will pray for you to find the strength to be the kind of person you know you can be, loving, caring and giving. I pray that you can overcome your addiction to drugs, that are clouding your vision of being a loving mother. Remember God is with you at all times. Please pray for me also. God Bless You and keep you safe."
"What will happen if you go in to a black hole?

The mathematics of black holes shows that they might be able to transport you to another region of space or possibly another universe. However, the mathematics also shows that the connection only lasts for a fraction of a second at a time, and that the link to other universes depends on a specific set of conditions which scientists do not believe to exist. Even if it were likely, however, the strong gravity field of the black hole tears apart any material falling into the hole so it would not come out the other end of the Black Hole looking anything like how it went in, so in other words you would  have to really want to make this discovery because you’re going to die trying."

"What is the avg monthly/annual (1) travel expense and (2) cell phone expense for sales reps in US and India?
Trying to compare sales rep expenses in India vs. US.  If you have this data only for India (or US), that would be okay too.
I guess it would depend on the industry. In the Information Technology industry in Industry (pan India travel) would be about US $ 30,000 a year. Cell phone expense may be about US $ 900 a year."
"What is the best way to lose weight really fast, before a graduation?
I need to lose wieght befor graduation because i do NOT want to be the fat girl at grad
Be VERY careful when trying to lose weight fast.  It is terribly bad for you to lose any more than 4 lbs a week.\n\nTo lose weight, you must exercise a LOT!  In addition, you should eat more than 3 times a day, but only tiny portions.  Maybe a half a fruit and some nuts.  Stay away from high fat items like mayonaise, cheese and fatty meats.  Eat fish, lean chicken or turkey, and PLENTY of vegetables.\n\nDon't forget to exercise every day.  Don't overdo it or you will burn yourslef out."

"If you have an UTI is it a wise idea to get oral??
Im just wondering if a guy gives a girl oral and she has a UTI will he catch it?? Is it grose??
UTIs are not contagious. They are contracted through bacteria entering the urethral opening, and if someone performs oral sex on you and you have a UTI, the person giving the oral sex will not contract the UTI. If you are the receiver of oral sex, it is possible for bacteria to enter the Urethra during this act and create or worsen a UTI. Often times, a UTI can be uncomfortable and painful, and anything inserted into the Vagina may cause irritation and the further need to urinate. Also, a UTI may leave a person feeling weak and fatigued. If you suspect that you may have a UTI, however, you should see your doctor immediately as a UTI can lead to a kidney infection."

"whats the quickest way to loose weight?

The quickest way isn't always the best way or the right way for you.  Here are 3 different approaches that work:\n\n1) The quickest by far is surgery, of course.  Liposuction is fast and works wonders- but actual stomach reductions (stapling, bypass etc) have not only been proven effective for weightloss but also in reducing the chances you'll develop adult onset diabetes.\n\n2) Next fastest is to eat a diet of 80% natural fats and 20% protein, in 5 small portions, with a target of 1000 calories a day.  This is like eating a 2 oz bag of macadamia nuts, or 2 oz of egg salad or tuna salad as a complete meal, every meal.  It works- and for any significant amount of weight it's better than starvation.  More importantly the high fat content of the diet ensures that your body continues to produce the hormones you need to retain muscle tissue- so you lose fat pounds and not muscle pounds.\n\n3) Probably the best long term solution to lose weight and improve your health is to follow a light excercise routine several times per week, and to eat a diet that is high in fiber and has a low glycemic index (that is- eat foods that are low in processed sugar and grains, preferring when you eat carbohydrates to try whole grains and natural sugars)."
"Is gravity the only force that keeps the moon facing the earth.?
We never see the far side of the moon! Does this mean the moon is not a satellite, but is really a sister planet?
The asymmetric nature of this gravitational interaction is also responsible for the fact that the Moon rotates synchronously, i.e. it is locked in phase with its orbit so that the same side is always facing toward the Earth. Just as the Earth's rotation is now being slowed by the Moon's influence so in the distant past the Moon's rotation was slowed by the action of the Earth, but in that case the effect was much stronger. When the Moon's rotation rate was slowed to match its orbital period (such that the bulge always faced toward the Earth) there was no longer an off-center torque on the Moon and a stable situation was achieved. The same thing has happened to most of the other satellites in the solar system. Eventually, the Earth's rotation will be slowed to match the Moon's period, too, as is the case with Pluto and Charon. \n\n Actually, the Moon appears to wobble a bit (due to its slightly non-circular orbit) so that a few degrees of the far side can be seen from time to time, but the majority of the far side (left) was completely unknown until the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 photographed it in 1959. (Note: there is no ""dark side"" of the Moon; all parts of the Moon get sunlight half the time (except for a few deep craters near the poles). Some uses of the term ""dark side"" in the past may have referred to the far side as ""dark"" in the sense of ""unknown"" (eg ""darkest Africa"") but even that meaning is no longer valid today!)"

A native or resident of North Carolina\nPerhaps from the tar that was once a major product of the state\n\nWhat is a Tar Heel?\nThe University not only uses the nickname ""Tar Heels,"" but the entire state does as well. One version of the nickname's origin has the name first being applied to North Carolinians during the Civil War. One record talks of a battle in Virginia, where their supporting column retreated, but North Carolina troops fought alone. The victorious troops were asked in a condescending tone by some Virginians, who had retreated, ""Any more tar down in the Old North State, boys?"" The response came quickly: ""No, not a bit; old Jeff's bought it all up."" The Virginians asked: ""Is that so? What is he going to do with it?"" The reply: ""He is going to put it on you'ns heels to make you stick better in the next fight."""
"I have been smoke free since Jan.1st why is it harder now then when I frist started and I am ready to go back?

First off...Congratulations! Let me tell you what good you have done for yourself and your loved ones...\n\n20 minutes after a smoker quits: Blood pressure drops to a level close to that before the last cigarette; Temperature of hands and feet increases to normal\n\n8 hours after a smoker quits: Carbon Monoxide level in blood drops to normal\n\n24 hours after a smoker quits: Chance of heart attack decreases\n\n2 weeks after a smoker quits: Circulation improves; Lung function increases up to 30%\n\n1 to 9 months after a smoker quits: Coughing, sinus congestion, fatigue, shortness of breath decrease; Cilia regain normal function in lungs, increasing ability to handle mucus, clean the lungs and reduce infection\n\n1 year after a smoker quits: Excess risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker's\n\nAre you going through some stressful times that you feel a cigarette will help ease the pressure? I am experienceing the same thing with pop. I do so good, then BAM, the urge to have a pop, any pop, is so intense I want to pull my hair out. I can feel for anybody stopping smoking.\n\nThe ""experts"" say that it takes 3 weeks to make, break, change a habit, but I feel that cigarettes and pop are beyond a habit. They are a crutch, and sometimes a ""good"" crutch, even though they are bad for us.\n\nTry this...everytime you want a cigarette, drink grapefruit juice...better yet, brush your teeth then drink grapefruit juice. Or put a rubber band on your wrist and snap it. As long as you can think of something else besides the cigarette, you should pass the craving easier. \n\nYour time frame is also like losing weight. You lose a lot at first and are happy, then you hit a plateau and can't lose any. You get discouraged. This is when you must try harder to keep on track.\n\nGood luck and again congratulations. Also add up the money you saved from not smoking. At an average of $5.00/name brand pack/day = ~$150.00/month."

"what company won the contract to widen the Panama Canal?

If you are referring to the Gaillard Cut widening, a project that began in 1992 and was completed in 2001, there were a number of contractors hired by the Panama Canal Commission and later on, by the Panama Canal Authority, to do all kinds of works, dredging, land removal, explosions, and so on.  Among those companies there was CUSA, a Panamanian company.  However, most of the work was carried out in house, including supervision of contractors.\n\nIf you are referring to Canal expansion with a new set of locks, there are no contractors considered yet, as the decision to go ahead with the project has not been made and requires of a national referendum for its approval."
"How/Where do I invest money with the safest or zero risk of losing my investment?

This is your money back guarantee.\n\nInvest the other 20$ in an Stock Index ETF. Returns in six years will vary, but you have a good chance of winning a healthy percentage and a extremely small chance of loosing more than a third in six years.

Application of science is technology. This is fundamental fact.

how can i whiten my teeth to 100% white w/o cosmetic dentistry ,bleach trays or whitestrips(r)?  (i hear witestrips r bad, but y?)
I use Chrest Whitestrips and I absolutely love them!  Ok, but besides what I like, here's what I can tell you.  Most whitening toothpastes don't work andt he ones that do work...they take too long to make a difference.  Cosmetic whitening can be expensive.  Chrest whitestips WORK!  After using them about two times, you can tell a difference.  They are kind of expensive...about $25-$35 depending on which kind you get, but they both work great.  If money is your concern, try the less expensive one.  It's kind of weird at first to feel something stuck to your teeth for 30 minutes.  And I suggest that when you take them off you have the toothbrush with toothpaste ready.  Don't lick your teeth after you take the strips off cuz the gel is NASTY!  Plus...some people, not all, experience soft teeth after using it.  It just feels like your teeth are soft and weak.  But I never experienced that.  I still use them, not everyday though.  Just when I'm going out and I want my teeth to look good.  Because let me tell you...yellow teeth is a BIG turn off.  Good luck with whatever you choose."
"Atheists: Is morality socially contructed?

Most morality is socially constructed, but some are so evident (do not murder, do not steal) that they are universally accepted. However, even these are open to question during certain circumstances (killing during war, stealing food to feed starving children).\n\nThe social construction of morality allows for a social contract that is vibrant and meets the needs of society as it changes. The religious foundation of morality creates a rigid, unyielding moral structure that leads to culture wars and ultimately the rejection of the religion. (See how England became Anglican instead of Roman Catholic.)"
"Could you abstain for life if you were taught heterosexuality was wrong?
This question is for heterosexual christians.  If religion taught hetersexuality was wrong and homosexuality was right, could you abstain your entire life or would you try to love homosexually or would you love hetersexually even though you were taught it was wrong?
Good question. don't know for sure til it happens. I plan to wait until marriage to have sex, and if I never marry, I may remain a virgin for the rest of my life. So I suppose I could, but is it really fair to expect that? I am sure that is part of your point. Why should homosexuals be expected to do something heterosexuals are not expected to do? I don't believe homosexuality is wrong, just different from society's definition of the norm. It might make reproduction difficult, but not everyone wants to have kids anyway. only God knows someones heart and the decision should be made between the people involved and God. don't worry about the opinions of others."

"I am 17 years old. My height is only 136cm. I am very thin too. Am i really normal?

First of all, don't worry about a perfect match, as we say in Mexico ""siempre hay un roto para un descosido"" translated would say ""there's always a broken for a unswed"" or something like that. Second, you need to know exactly what your genetical status is, if your family is of same complexion, then it is ok. Sometimes a gene remains hidden for a long time. Then, if you really have a growth problem, 136cm is not bad, there are a lot of people who like short people. And by the way 136cm is 4.45ft for those who want to answer also."

"Where can i get some free marketing plans for a juice bar?
Maybe some samples of free juice bar marketing plans, to get an idea of ho to make my marketing plan.
If you have to ask this question, you have no business making your own marketing plan. I apologize if this sounds harsh, but there's a good reason why the majority of food services fail. Most owners go into business thinking good products and service will make them successful when it's just not true. Effective management systems and marketing make a business successful, not products and service. Products and service must meet the expectations of a customer once they get in the door, but they will not be the reason for a customer's buying decision. People buy to fulfill emotions. Successful marketing campaigns are based on promising customers a certain feeling when they come into a business, then developing a unique selling point that helps deliver that feeling to the customer. This unique selling point and the feeling is then incorporated into every aspect of the businesses marketing. In a food service, that could include the food selection, menu design, store interior/exterior design, signage, advertising, letterhead and any other item that represents the business. Successful businesses do not sell products, they sell feelings.\n\nSome examples:\nMcDonalds does not sell hamburgers. McDonalds sells convenience to adults and fun to children.\nHard Rock Cafe does not sell food. They sell nostalgia.\nHooters does not sell wings. They sell sex.\nBurger King does not sell burgers. They sell accomodation (Have it your way).\nTavern on the Green does not sell gourmet food. They sell stature.\nSubway does not sell sandwiches. They sell health.\n\nThe SBA is a good resource, but even with the best ""samples"" in the world, an inexperienced marketer cannot develop a solid marketing plan. Even most marketing companies don't have a clue about solid marketing plans. They specialize in negotiating good prices on advertising, then reselling the advertising to clients for a profit.\n\n\nBrandon O'Dell\nO'Dell Consulting\nRestaurants/Retail/Bars\n(316) 361-0675\nbodell1@cox.net\nhttp://www.bodellconsulting.com\n\nFree initial consultations"

If you are depressed at the moment some of the following symptoms may sound familiar: \n\nYou feel miserable and sad.\nYou feel exhausted a lot of the time with no energy .\nYou feel as if even the smallest tasks are sometimes impossible.\nYou seldom enjoy the things that you used to enjoy-you may be off sex or food or may 'comfort eat' to excess.\nYou feel very anxious sometimes. \n\nYou don't want to see people or are scared to be left alone. Social activity may feel hard or impossible.\n\nYou find it difficult to think clearly.\n\nYou feel like a failure and/or feel guilty a lot of the time.\n\nYou feel a burden to others.\n\nYou sometimes feel that life isn't worth living. \n\nYou can see no future. There is a loss of hope. You feel all you've ever done is make mistakes and that's all that you ever will do.\nYou feel irritable or angry more than usual.\n\nYou feel you have no confidence.\n\nYou spend a lot of time thinking about what has gone wrong, what will go wrong or what is wrong about yourself as a person. You may also feel guilty sometimes about being critical of others (or even thinking critically about them).\nYou feel that life is unfair.\n\nYou have difficulty sleeping or wake up very early in the morning and can't sleep again. You seem to dream all night long and sometimes have disturbing dreams.\n\nYou feel that life has/is 'passing you by.'\n\nYou may have physical aches and pains which appear to have no physical cause, such as back pain.\n\nIt's this wealth of depression symptoms, and the broad scope that confuses many people as to what depression actually is.

Its just courtesy to say hi!you never know when you might need them to pick up your mail or whatever or visa versa.The thing is having a balance.The last thing you want is annoying neighbours who come over all the time.Just be brief!They probably arent saying hi to you because you arent saying hi to them.Be bold and make the first move.Its liberating.If they say nothing,then screw them and try another neighbour.See how you go.You could ask them a question like ,what day does the trash get taken out or what time does the mail arrive or where is the nearest gas station etc etc.........just as an ice breaker"
"If an employee is denied a stress claim by work comp. but still has orig.diag. from her Dr. is FMLA an option?
I am trying to determine whether or not to allow use of sick time to recapture time loss costs expended by our workers comp provider.
FMLA only applies to companies with 50 or more employees within a certain mile radius so you may not even be eligible. You also get time off with your position preserved for you, but no pay while you are on leave :-( You may however, appeal the denial of your claim and win. Most cases that go to hearing resolve in favor of the claimant,not the insurance, although adjusters may not necessarily want you to know that. I strongly suggest getting a worker's compensation attorney to represent you. You have many many rights and payments are pretty hard to deny, particularly with a diagnosis from your doctor which carries more weight than one from one of their hired MDs (independent medical examiners(IME) )although often times adjusters will and people give up without a fight thinking that the laws are in favor of the insurance. They are not. I worked for the insurances, and specifically worker's compensation,hence I am truly not steering you wrong. You need an attorney to deal with these people though. They are aggressive, don't want to pay, and you need a lawyer that will be equally  aggresive on your behalf. Many of these attorneys can be found under disability law in your phone  book.  Fight for your money! If you do, you are likely to get it :-)Best of luck"

"What is exercise physiology principles?
I have to write a brief statement of the application of exercise physiology principles. I have no idea what it is!
exercise physiology principle relate to how the body responds to different types of exercise related principles; such as resistance (strength) training, endurance(cardiovascular) training, and range of motion (flexibility), in other words how does the body respond in regards to these types of training. Some examples are hypertrophy (increased muscle size) with resistance exercise, increased oxygen utilization by tissues such as muscle and increased cardiac output with endurance exercise, and permanent elastic changes with flexibility exercises. \n\nHope this helps!"

"What can happen if I stop paying credit card bills that add about $16000?
I am flat broke, my car is getting repo and I lost my job.  I want to know the bad part of not paying off credit card debt.
File for bankruptcy instead. You'll end up paying a much smaller percentage of what you owe and then creditors constant calls will be on hold. While your looking for a job try to get a temp job. You'll have money in your pocket, new references, and an inside chance at jobs that open up at the place you are temporairly working. Good luck."
"Getting bigger muscles?
Is the best way to gain more mass, increasing the amount you lift each week, and getting good sleep (8hours) and diet? am i missing anything else? I never do deadlifts, but  i do squat.
If you want more mass continue alternating every other day the lifts that you're doing.  chest and shoulders on Monday, arms on tuesday, legs on wednesday, chest & shoulders on thursday, etc.  Also incorporate cardio in your workout, it'll increase the bloodflow to your muscles.  Eat WHOLE WHEAT pasta several times a week, NOT enriched wheat pasta but whole wheat pasta.  Also, and this is super important, knock out the trans fats in your diet.  When I knocked that stuff outta my diet I noticed a very definitive difference in my strength and stamina.  Not sure why, but I guess that crap is as bad as they say it is.  \n\nAlso, alternate the order in which you do your weights.  For example, if you always start with flies, then move to bench, start with bench, then go to incline bench, then hit your delts, then incline flies, etc.  That helps as well.  \n\nMost important, have fun and enjoy the results!"
"how do bees fly?

According to Law of Aerodynamics, bees cannot fly but bees do not follow such law. So how do bees fly? It is one question which science had not given a concise explanation thus anyone can say : ""Because God designed them to have the ability to fly"".  \n\nOne of the scientific answers how bees fly correlates it to bees  vestigial pair of wings. Scientists who has claimed to finally figure out how bees fly said that ""as insects get smaller, their aerodynamic performance decreases and to compensate, they tend to flap their wings faster. The much larger honeybee flaps its wings 230 times every second."" ""They do extra work (like carrying large loads) by stretching out their wing stroke amplitude but do not adjust wingbeat frequency.""♥"

Tell them YOU will pay THEM and they MIGHT come in.\n\nIt is almost impossible to find a guy that gives massages to women who does not do SOMETHING creepy.\nEven my yoga instructor, a really nice guy, who give massages very cheap to women who take his classes, sticks his fingers in the women's ears I am told.

"what are the reasons for unemployment in japan?

I'd have to say there are a number of factors, starting with the economy. Once the economic bubble collapsed companies resorted to restructuring to survive. Employment adjustments centered on middle-aged and older office workers. In particular, white-collar managers who fit these age categories and were considered redundant became a prime target for restructuring. Faced with unemployment these people simply CANNOT get another job. If you look at the job listings in Japan they are VERY CLEAR about the age limits. There are FEW jobs for those 40+ people. (Sad, isn't it?) \n Another serious issue, however, is how the latent unemployment rate is affecting young people. With dismal recruitment conditions for new graduates becoming the norm, a growing number of discouraged coeds are withdrawing to domestic work and the like. Many simply settle for any part time job they get and end up quitting. (A few of the young Japanese people I meet with are currently in this situation.)\n The future of the Japanese economy is not necessarily promising. Problems related to a strong yen will not be alleviated in the near term, and industrial hallowing out is accelerating, with many production facilities moving overseas, resulting in forced unemployment. \n These are just a few reasons and the other answers name others as well. Hope this helps!"
"I'm really confused about capacitors:?
I undrestand the charging up part, but don't know what happens when they discharge, is the circuit disconnected or does it just discharge when its full up? I'm very confused, thanks for any help!
they discharge when there is no longer anything charging them. they charge because a voltage is put across them, which causes charges to collect on opposite sides. when the voltage is removed (or short cicuited) there is nothing forcing the opposite charges to opposite sides. the capacitor discharges because opposites attract, and these opposite charges are now free to cancel each other out."

Here are some great weight dropping tips!\n\nEating Tips\n\nGood things come in small packages. Here's a trick for staying satisfied while still keeping portions under control: Cut high-calorie foods like cheese and chocolate into smaller pieces. It will seem like you're getting more than you actually are.\n\n\nDon't give up dips. If you love creamy dips and sauces, don't cut them out of your diet completely. Just use low-fat sour cream or mayo instead of the full-fat stuff.\n\n\nGet water-wise. Make a habit of reaching for a glass of water instead of a high-calorie snack. It will help your overall health as well as your waistline. Add some zest with a twist of lemon or lime.\n\n\nHerb it up. Stock up your spice rack, and start growing a small herb garden in your kitchen window. Spices and herbs add fantastic flavor to foods without adding fat or calories.\n\n\nSlim down your soup. Make a big batch of soup and refrigerate it before you eat it. As it cools, the fat will rise to the top. Skim it off the surface for reduced fat content.\n\n\nDoggie-bag that dinner. At restaurants, ask the server to put half your entrée in a doggie bag before bringing it to your table. Putting the food away before you start your meal will help you practice portion control.\n\n\nListen to your cravings. If you're craving something sweet, eat something sweet — just opt for a healthier nosh, like fruit, instead of a high-calorie one. The same goes for crunchy cravings — for example, try air-popped popcorn with soy sauce instead of high-fat tortilla chips. It's just smart substitution!\n\n\nEase your way into produce. If you're new to eating lots of fruits and veggies, start slowly. Just add them to the foods you already enjoy. Pile veggies on top of your sandwiches, or add fruit to your cereal.\n\n\nLook for high-fat hints. Want an easy way to identify high-calorie entrees? Keep an eye out for these words: au gratin, parmigiana, tempura, alfredo, creamy and carbonara, and enjoy them in moderation.\n\n\nDon't multitask while you eat. If you're working, reading or watching TV while you eat, you won't be paying attention to what's going into your mouth — and you won't be enjoying every bite. Every time you sit down for a meal, sit down. Chew slowly and pay attention to flavors and textures. You'll enjoy your food more and eat less.\n\n\nTaste something new. Broaden your food repertoire — you may find you like more healthy foods than you knew. Try a new fruit or vegetable. (Ever had jicama, plantain, bok choy, starfruit or papaya?)\n\n\nLeave something on your plate at every meal. One bite of bagel, half your sandwich, the bun from your burger. See if you feel satisfied eating just a bit less.\n\n\nGet to know your portion sizes. It's easy to underestimate how much you're eating. Don't just estimate things — make sure. Ask how much is in a serving, read the fine print on labels, measure your food. And learn portion equivalents: One serving of pasta, for instance, should be around the size of a tennis ball.\n\n\nMake a healthy substitution. Learn to swap healthier foods for their less-healthful counterparts. Find a substitution that works for you: Use skim milk instead of whole milk; make up a batch of brownie mix with applesauce instead of oil; try a whole-grain bread instead of white.\n\n\nBring lunch to work. Packing lunch will help you control your portion sizes. It also provides a good alternative to restaurants and fast-food joints, where making healthy choices every day can be challenging (not to mention expensive).\n\n\nHave some dessert. You don't have to deny yourself all the time. Have a treat that brings you pleasure, but this time enjoy it guilt-free — be sure you're practicing portion control, and compensate for your indulgence by exercising a little more or by skipping your afternoon snack.\n\n\nAsk for what you need. Tell your mother-in-law you don't w"

"How can I comfort and provide support for my bestfriend who's going through a rough time?
My bestfriend (20, Male) goes to school across the country away from home. We're childhood friends, and he confides in me. Things were going great until a year ago when his mom was diagnosed with cancer in her nose. Due to the horrible news, his GPA went down and was almost suspended from school. Recently he found out that his mother fell down the stairs and has broken both her legs and is now bed ridden, and that the cancer has spread to 5 different parts of hre body, 2 out of the 5 are in her brain. Plus, his long time girlfriend dumped him on valentines day. We talk a lot and he tells me that he may not pass his courses this semester, and that all he wants to do is to be at home because his mom is dying. How can I give him support, and what can I do and say to make him feel better?
All I can tell you is to continue to do what you are doing...being there for him. When my mother passed away suddenly, without the forewarning your friend has been given, it was someone like you who helped me through it, even though she didn't know how much she held my broken heart together.\n\nYou may never know your healing effect upon your friend, sweetheart, but just be there for him...a rock, a shoulder to cry on (when men aren't supposed to be allowed to show such weakness), the one he can call in the middle of the night when it gets really tough. Even if he never comes out and says it, you will have made all the difference in the world.\n\nAnd isn't that all that each of us wish to do at least once in our lives for someone else?"
"why dont my kids listen to me?

I would say, based on the little information given, the biggest problem why kids don't listen is a lack of consistent parenting. If you are going to be a strict parent which doesn't allow anything you don't approve of, then be that. If you're going to be a parent who is lenient and allows them a longer leash, then so be it. But don't be one today and the other tomorrow. Set down consistent rules and stick to them. And when you tell them there are going to be consequences for not doing as they are told, stick to them.\n\nFor example let's say you tell them to be home by a certain time. If they don't they are to be grounded for 1 week. Now let's say they are 5 minutes late- you do nothing. Eventually, they will start being 10, then 30 minutes, then an hour late. Now let's say you do ground them for week and then you decide to let them out of it after 3 days. Doing this kind of thing as a parent only encourages kids not to listen.\n\nIt's not a matter of being mean. It's a matter of showing kids that life has rules and in the real world, consequences are much more serious than they are as a kid. You do them a favor by being consistent in your parenting."
"What are the advantages/disadvantages of running and walking on a treadmill as opposed to sidewalk?

Pros of treadmill: Treadmills are padded so they are better for your joints, you dont have to worry about the weather or crime, you can watch tv. You can control the incline which can give you better exercise at lower speeds (which means even less stress on your joints).\n\nCons: You end up watching more tv rather than getting outside and enjoying the fresh air and the real world. Treadmills are notorious for breaking, you should expect no more than 1 years worth of regular use before you throw it away. I cannot stress this last point enough. Expensive treadmills feel more natural but will not last any longer. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR SERVICE CONTRACT UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO THROW THE THING AWAY.\n\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM."
"What should I or can do?
What my problem is is that prior to signing my lease, I asked if I could sign a month to month lease.

Well I messed up and I didn't have him write that on the lease, and shortly after  new management took over, which I didn't know was gonna happen and now they are saying that there is no way out of my lease and that I have to stay there for the remainder of the term of the lease, which would be July 31st.  I just lost my job so I can't afford to live thereuntil then.  I am currently on a waitung list for low income housing. Can I get out of it? Can someone please help me and give me some suggestions? Should I talk to a lawyer?
Sweetie I hate to tell you this but unless it is in writing then there is really nothing you can do. You really have 2 options:\n\nOption 1: Stay there until the end of your lease\n\nOption 2: Break the lease and make payment arrangements (if the landlord allows for that) or have it go on your credit.\n\nGood Luck"

Add the pork rinds and the RC Cola, and the hissy fit actually adds 36 calories. \n\nRecommendation: a good hissy fit, accompanied by some plain old fashioned butt kicking is the very best.

"What is the best way to get rid of hiccups?

I don't know the duration of your hiccups and your age, as both are very important information for what you're asking.\n\nHiccups usually stop within a few minutes to a few hours.\nHiccups that last longer than 48 hours are called persistent hiccups and those that last for days are called intractable hiccups.\nIt is not often but intractable hiccups can cause exhaustion, lack of sleep, and weight loss.\nSometimes, although not always, hiccups that persist may indicate the presence of another medical problem and require an exam by a health professional.\n\nSo in case your hiccups are persistent and before you do any amateur remedy, I would suggest you visit a specialized doctor.\n\nI'm really not trying to scare you, but in my case persistent hiccups were a symptom of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) that was in progress."

"Is it healthier for women to take an hour long shower, or should we get in, get out, and be done?
I had a friend tell me that girls should take hour long showers, because it's healthier, but I can't decide wether this is true or not.
I don't think it makes any difference as long as you get the job done well.  I'm not aware of anyone who has a hot water tank that will last through an hour long shower, but even if you do, the hot water will dry out your skin.  A moisturizing bath however is a different matter.  It will not dry your skin as much.\n\nI think your friend is feeding you a bunch of bull.  Staying in the shower longer will not make you any healthier.  On the other hand, there is no need to rush either."

Depends how long do you plan on staying in your house.\n\nA better option is to pay off a little more than you owe every months. The extra money will go towards your principal. (usually you take 1 paiement divided by 12 and add that to your monthly paiment).\n\nDoing that you will not only payoff your mortgage earlier, but you will build equity on your home faster."

"The God of Christian and god of Muslim are one?

no way i quote 700 club.,\n     Under no circumstances is Jehovah, the God of the bible, and Allah, of the Koran, the same. First of all, the God of the bible is a God of love and redemption. who sent His Son into the world to die for our sins. Allah tells people to die for him in order to get salvation, but there is no understanding of salvation. Allah was the moon god from Mecca. that is why Islam has the crescent moon.The flag of Turkey has a crescent with a star in it. Well, the crescent moon is because Allah was the moon god. and that's the deal. But we don't serve moon god. We serve the God of creation, the Creator of everything.\n     They are not the same. To translate Allah as God is wrong. When you see something in there and it says Allah, you translate it Allah, don't call it God because its different. God is Elihim. He is the Creator, the Jehovah God, Yahweh. Yahweh of the old testament was the Father who brought forth Jesus into the world.\n         P.S don't kill the messenger it is my job as a server of the true living God to spread the truth."

"How is the converservation of energy maintatined with a campfire?
Log goes on fire, fire consumes log produces heat, heat and ash, heat is dissiapated and equalized by the atmosphere, thereby adding some infintesimal amount of heat to the steady state bio system.  Since the beginning of time there have been a lot of camp fires.  So where's all the heat going.
Well part of it is absorbed by the oceans which are giant heat sinks and of course a lion share is used up condensing water out those cold clouds to make rain.  If you follow this train of thought out the rain gets absorbed by trees which grow up to become fire wood for people to burn in their campfires.  And round and round we go."

"How is it that people have their own language and how do they make these languages and understand them?
For example, the Philippines originated a language called Filipino. There are dialects like Tagalog, Ilocano, Visayan and more. SO to make it clearer, how do they know what that word means and how they created the dialects.
It all started waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back to biblical days\nBabel is mentioned in Genesis 10:10 as the home city of Nimrod.\n\n[10] And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. [11] Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, [12] And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. (KJV) \nAccording to Genesis 11:1-9, mankind, after the deluge, travelled from the mountain of the East, where the ark had rested, and settled in 'a plain in the land of Shinar' (or Sennar). Here, they attempted to build a city and a tower whose top might reach unto Heaven, the Tower of Babel.\n\nThe Origin of Languages\nThe all-wise Creator, Jehovah God, has employed language in the heavenly angelic realm. (Job 1:6-12; 1 Corinthians 13:1) When he created humans, he implanted in them a vocabulary and the ability to expand it. There is no evidence of any primitive human language consisting of grunts and growls. On the contrary, consider what the Encyclopædia Britannica explains about Sumerian, the oldest known written language: ""The Sumerian verb, with its . . .various prefixes, infixes, and suffixes, presents a very complicated picture.""\n\n\nAt Babel, God confused the language\nof rebellious humans\n\nAbout the 20th century B.C.E., contrary to God's command to spread out and ""fill the earth,"" humans made an effort to control all society at the Plains of Shinar, in Mesopotamia, and began building the religious Tower of Babel. Language diversity originated when God confused their common language, thwarting their dangerous and hurtful plans.—Genesis 1:28; 11:1-9.\n\nThe Bible record does not say that all languages descended from the original one. At Shinar, God introduced many new vocabularies and thought patterns, resulting in a variety of languages. Thus, efforts to trace a parent language from which all others developed have been in vain.\n \n\nLanguage is a divine gift. (Exodus 4:11) The fascinating process of change in language shows how flexible this gift is. We may also learn from language that no one group of people is superior to another, for there is no such thing as an inferior language. Just as with other divine gifts, language is equally available to all people, no matter what their culture or the place where they live. Since the very beginning, languages of all peoples have been complete enough to serve their purpose. Each one of them is worthy of respect, regardless of how many people use it.\n\nHistorical and Social Factors\nThe gregarious nature of mankind is reflected in language. Thus, when there is contact between cultures—a common occurrence—the languages of those cultures retain evidence of such contact for generations.\n\nFor instance, through its many words of Arabic origin, Spanish, considered a modified version of Latin, retains a record of the eighth-century Muslim conquest of Spanish territory. The influence of Greek, French, English, and other languages on Spanish can also be traced. Moreover, in the Spanish spoken in America, traces remain of the ancient inhabitants of the continent. For example, Spanish there contains many words from the Nahuatl language of Aztec Central America.\n\nJust as a mother tongue identifies individuals with a certain nation and even with a region, language usage can identify people with a group, such as a profession, a trade, cultural and sports groups, or even criminal organizations. The list is practically endless. Linguists call these special variations jargon or slang or sometimes even a dialect.\n\nHowever, when there are animosities between nations and ethnic or cultural groups, language ceases to be a bridge. It can become a wall that adds to the divisions between people.\n\nThe Future of Languages\nCommunication is a complex matter. On one hand, the modern tendency is toward breaking down linguistic walls, primarily on account of mas"
"For Christians only - WHAT MAKES A GOOD CHURCH?
What makes a good church?  Folks often give advice and then say 'go and find yourself a 'good church' ' and it can be hard to define what one is.\n\nso what is a good church?\n\nhow do you know (when visiting a church) if it is a good one or not?\n\nhow can you tell if they are not truthful with you at the start but only stuff dawns on you once you try and get your feet under the table?
everything. the congregation, the pastor, the church staff, volunteers, etc. Also staying dead on with the scriptures and being open to new converts and believers. Also, just because a church doesn't have all the amenities you may want at the present time doesn't mean that it should be overlooked.  \n\nSometimes all they need is you to step up to the plate.

"State three examples of human activities that could endanger Botana curus?
im in 9th grade so plz use terms u think i would understand
Botana curus produces Curol, a compound used for treating certain kinds of cancer.  Curol can not be produced in the laboratory.\n  Botana curus grows very slowly and is on the endangered species list, so its ability to provide curol in large quantities is limited\n  I do not quite remember where they grow( i learned that briefly in college, but if it is a terrestrial plant ( grows on land ) I would think that any of the other things that endanger other plants would endanger this one. Lets say, burning of forests to open area for farms. Introducing cows and other herbivorous (plant eating) in fields where the plants grow. If it is a strictly cold weather plant, may be the greenhouse effect (you know with the heating of the planet and so on. e-mail me with the exact environment where they grow and I will give do your homework! good luck"

"Genetic Questions?
A man and woman both have normal color vision, but a daughter has red-green color blindness, a sex-linked recessive trait.  The man sues his wife for divorce on ground of infidelity.  If you were his attorney, could you use this evidence in your case?  EXPLAIN!
The genes for red/green vision is on the X chromosome; men have 1 X and women have 2; one is active and one is inactive (Barr body).  If the father and mother were not color-blind, she may be a carrier (it's a recessive disease, she has 2 Xs), but he can not (since he has only one X).  So by simple genetics his daughter is not his offspring, since she is color blind.  However I could also argue that she is a hybrid or has a random mutation during development to knock out the second allele.  So you could argue both ways but the likelyhood is the former arguement, that because of simple genetics she isn't his biological offspring.\n\nIn regards to lyonization, you have to remember that the mother carrier would also be lyonized and by the terms of the question has 'normal color vision', so random inactivation of the mutant X can not account for loss of color vision.  In physiological terms this means that if half of the vision cells express the red/green color genes, it's sufficient for normal vision."

Primary teeth erupting varies from child to child just like taking first steps varies.  Generally the first teeth to erupt are the lower central incisors at around 6 - 10 months of age.  The remaining primary teeth should all erupt by the age of 2 1/2 - 3."
"Why does my pee smell after I eat asparagus?

One possible reason may be the glucosinolates present in asparagus and other brassica vegetables.  Through a series of chemically transforming steps during digestion, glucosinolates become molecules such as Indole-3-carbinol that modulate (usually up-regulate) the activity of certain enzymes in your body involved in detoxification and metabolism.  This process may lead to a transient increase in certain odoriferous metabolites that are eliminated in urine.\n\nBest wishes!"

Money is the number one issue for arguments in most of all relationships.

All other purchase can come out of an "" allowance that you both have weekly or monthly.

Is the one supreme God that I as a Christian believe in the same God that the Jewish and Islamic people believe in? Basically all the religions believe in the same God as the One Almighty yet wars, terrorism, and religious violence break out all over the world...am I correct here?
The Jews believe in Jehovah but not in Christ or Mohammed.\nThe Muslims believe Jesus was a prophet, but they follow the teaching of Mohammed.\nThe Christians believe in Jehovah and Christ, but believe Mohammed was not a prophet of God.\n\nThe God that the Jews and Christians worship does not call on them to kill or enslave those who don't believe as they do.  The Muslims believe that their god does call on them to do this.  I do not think the same God would have such contradictory teachings.  For this reason, I do not believe that the Muslims follow the same God as the Jews and Christians."

"how to terminate pragnancy?

Ladies, if a woman is asking the question about how to terminate a pregnancy, it is not up to you to convince her one way or another whether she should do it.  The question is how to do it, not whether or not it should be done.  You would think that if you cared so much of the life of this unborn child that you would understand that living is not always the best option.  I'm sure everyone can think of a situation, place where they would not want to exist...and don't lie to yourself.\nAnyways, the first route to terminating a pregnancy is to take the morning after pill within 72 hours of intercourse.  Most women take this pill if they believe that their condom broke or had unprotected sex in the heat of the moment.\nThe next route is obviously abortion.  You should be able to find a clinic or hospital where you live that will do it.  If you are in your first trimester, all abortion clinics will provide the procedure.  If you are in your third trimester, there will be very few clinics that will provide the operation as the fetus is too developed at this point.  Most places will only do it if you are direct harm if the fetus is not aborted.  If you are in your second trimester, there is a chance some clinics will and some won't perform the procedure.  So you need to do some research and make sure you know how far along you are.\n\nIf adoption is an option and you know the fetus is healthy, you should consider carrying it to term and then putting it up for adoption.  I'm adopted and would always recommend this option first if the baby is healthy.  If the baby is not healthy then you need to consider your options and YES abortion is one of them."

"How do you know we can split an atom if you can not  see it with your own two eyes?

Well, aside from the incredible wealth of supporting evidence as to the existence of an atom (that is what you are really asking, right?) there are a couple of great historic events that prove we can split an atom. Furthermore, while you cannot see a single atom, everything that you do see is an aggregation of atoms. But, back to how we know, in August of 1945, the second world war was ended by dropping two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. You see, at it's simplest, an atom bomb's power is derived from the chain reaction that occurs from the splitting of the atom. Lord knows, no one has ever seen what happens when an atom is split. So, how do we know that we can split an atom? I mean, it's not like the threat of splitting an atom over a major population center didn't hold the world in a cold war for the better part of a century. Wow dude. I mean seriously, wow."

"Regarding christians who often praise Jesus...?
OK this question is going to seem mean but I really think there's truth to it.\n\nChristians who constantly profess their love for Jesus (even during everyday conversation); It seems to me they're compensating.  You wouldn't constantly proclaim your love for your parents, children, job, etc as you do with your faith.\n\nOf couse they claim its because they love him so much, but how often do they shout out, ""Praise my parents!"" or ""With my children's love!""\n\nDoes it seem a little phony for some christians to constantly proclaim their love for Jesus?  Yes or No?
I think some Christians take it to an extreme.  On the one hand, we should praise Jesus often, as it shows our love for him.  On the other hand, praising him too much can become mere routine.  The more we do it, the more we become accustomed to it and it becomes just words.  I think a lot of it is because some Christians feel like the more they do that, they more they are trying to make God believe they care.  But just as Jesus said not to let your prayers be filled with vain repetitions, as the hypocrites, for they think they will be heard because of their many words...so it is with praising Jesus.  If you walk through life saying /big breath: ""praiseJesuspraiseJesuspraiseJesuspraiseJesuspraiseJesus"" etc, I'm betting he'll get tired of hearing that.  He'd likely be more pleased with hearing it when we feel like telling him we love him, rather than hearing the empty words all day long."
"Why do people think that every religion that carries a bible is True Christianity?
Why do Catholics call themselves Christians whereas  thier prayers involve Mary the mother of Jesus? True Christians in the book of Acts never did that!\n\nWhy do Mormons call themselves Christians whereas they have the third testament, Book of Mormon, despite the fact that the bible tells us not to add another gospel in Galatians 1:8  ""But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed?""\n\nWhy do backslidden ex-Christians call themselves ""christians"" even in their backslidden stage?\n\nWhy do people who never gave themselves to Jesus think they are Christians just because they grew up in a Christian family?\n\nWhy do many people think that their good works qualify them to be christian without to accept the deity of Jesus?\n\nWhy do people think admiring Jesus will save them? I mean admiring Jesus is not to surrender to Him!\n\nBe kind enough to answer these questions...Please don't fight,just answer.
Cause everyone has the right to believe whatever they want to believe and call themselves whatever they want to call themselves.\n\nBesides, Christians, that is just a name given to those who believe Jesus is the Christ, and follow his teaching.  I don't think anyone could actually call themselves a Christian seriously if they do not believe, they are just kidding themselves."

i agree with the second one.  water is clearly defined as having two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.  if it doesn't have oxygen, then it can't be water.\n\nit is possible that the ""water"" is actually liquid hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.  if the ""water"" is a solid, it can be the frozen of anything above plus lots of other compounds or elements.\n\nif this meteorite was found on earth, then it probably wasn't any of those either since it would have melted.  if it was still a meteor in space, then it could be.  comets are known to have ""ice"" and dust as their tail.  this isn't really ice as in water turned to ice, but ice is used to refer to other elements or compounds in the solid form (dry ice is CO2).\n\nif you read that in an article in a magazine or newspaper, they were probably try to make it easier to understand what they were trying to say, and decided to use water to describe a liquid or ice to describe the solid that they found."
"What substances, when they come in to contact with magnesium, cause and explosion?

Magnesium is considered a reactive metal.  As such, many different compounds are considered to be hazardous to have in contact with magnesium:\n\nHazardous Decomposition Products: \nToxic gases and vapors may be released if involved in a fire. \nHazardous Polymerization: \nWill not occur. \nIncompatibilities: \nMagnesium reacts dangerously with many substances, including oxidizers, carbonates, cyanides, chlorinated hydrocarbons, sulfates, acids, and other metals. Please refer to the NFPA publication ""Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials"" most recent edition for details. Reacts with acids to form hydrogen gas. \nConditions to Avoid: \nMoisture, heat, flames, ignition sources and incompatibles. \n\nHalogenated solvents should ALWAYS be avoided around Mg, as under proper conditions, explosions can occur."

is a week-long holiday observance held from December 26 to January 1 honoring African-American heritage, primarily in the United States. Timed to serve as an alternative to the growing commercialism of Christmas, it was founded in 1966 by Ron Karenga (Ron Everett). Whatever its original intent, Kwanzaa has captured the imagination of many in the African-American community and has increasingly become an important celebration."

"I just bought a ""military"" gold plated ring on line, do military men wear gold plated?
I paid 55 euros for it.  I now see them on e-bay for 34.99 USD + shipping.  Should I still accept the ring, the buyer said that I could still refuse the buy.  They are not shipped out of the country but have family that would send it to me.\nMy eyes were bigger than my brain, I thought that it was a real golden ring.
Obviously, military people are not going to wear military issued rings in combat, but depending on the time frame they could be real.

If the buyer said no, I would accept the extra 10 dollars you might have to pay as this is a luxury item anyway."

"With centripetal acceleration, when would the normal force of motorcyclist be zero?
The motorcylist is riding his motorcycle up and down a hill.  The question was how fast can he can before he loses touch with the ground?  I was told that the weight has to be more than the normal force to keep him on the ground and to determine the maximum speed and we use a zero quantity for the normal force.  Why?
Since the magnitude of the acceleration is v^2/r, and the radius of the Earth is approximately 4000 miles (21120000 ft), you would have to solve the following equation: v^2/21120000=32\nv^2=675840000\nv=25997feet per second  or\nv=4.92 miles per second"

There is a difference between a sample and population mean. Because you used only 16 books, the data could be significantly skewed. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to claim that the population shows similar charcteristics."
"How important is religion (faith, etc.) in your family life?

It guides me on all aspects of my life. There're alot of values enforced by public figures or famous people to go by. But none are good enough than the truth from God. \n\nBecause at the end of the day if I ask you, ""Will you steal for money?"" You may say ""No"". But there'll be a point if I offer you millions of dollars, that will alter your value and your decision to steal for me.\n\nWith religion and faith, there's a core value to live by that at no point should be altered because of more money etc. You can see today's argument on the war in Iraq, the divided debate on abortion, the fight for gay marriage, the discrimination of minorities.

The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g C.\n\nSince water's density is 1 g/ mL, 500 mL of water will have a mass of 500 g.\n\nThe equation to calculate the joules of energy required is:\nheat = mass x specific heat x change in temperature\n\nenergy = 500 (4.184)(95-25)\nenergy = 146440 J or 146.44 kJ\n\nHope that helped."
"If I died while having doubts about Jesus Christ being the only way to Heaven..?
but was actively seeking out this knowledge so that I can be unbreakable in my faith, will I go to Hell?
You won't find the answer to that question here. I too have doubts about Jesus. Some of the stories in the bible are pretty hard to believe, unless it's blind faith.  Paul Bunyon and Santa are equally believable.\nRemember, God didn't write the bible.  Nor did he sit for in interview with a writer.  The bible was written by men, quite likely several generations after the time of Jesus.  Stories were probably embellished as they passed from person to person.  Then another man gathered the stories together, edited out what he saw fit to print and assembled the first bible several hundred years after the time of Jesus.  Because of this I think God will forgive you if you don't believe everything you read in the bible or about Jesus.\nI believe that God is in all of us and knows what is in our hearts.  What awaits us after death is based on what kind of person we are in life.  It is surely more important than whether or not we believe a bunch of 2000 year old stories.  I believe this to be true and I live by it but I suppose that does not make it nessessarily true.  \nLive with peace and love in your heart.  God Knows."

"How detailed can satellite imagery be? Can it make out the license plate on a car?

The short answer is: No one really knows, since the details are classified. Also, the current satellite performance is probably not as good as what it CAN be. \n\nI think that comparing what astronomers are able to do with what the best satellites are able to do can be a bit misleading. \n\n1. The space telescope does not have to look through the air, with the water vapor and turbulence and dust. The space telescope has only the very outer reaches of the atmosphere to look through. \n\n2. The space telescope and ground-based astronomers do not have at their disposal anywhere near the resources that governmental organizations do. For example, the space telescope was not even calibrated, because there was so little money! It was only because of heroic efforts and a few minor miracles that the space telescope was brought into focus. The space telescope is basically a toy, and has barely been able to get funded for the last few years, and might be soon decommissioned. \n\n3. Astronomers just do not have the interest, the background, the training, the knowledge, or the resources to command the type of bleeding-edge technology that governments do. Astronomers for the most part are mired in phenomenology, and do not worry much about the details of pedestrian things like optics. Optics is, in general, disparaged by astronomers and left to the ""engineers"" and other lesser beings like mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, computer scientists, etc. Basically, astronomers hurt themselves with their attitudes and their culture. \n\n4. No responsible government is going to announce what they are capable of seeing with their satellites. All of this material is very closely held at best, and most likely highly classified. \n\n5. It is well known (or at least often reported in the newspapers, so it might not be correct) that spy satellites are so big and so heavy because they bring a large reserve of fuel with them so that they can be lowered and raised as needed to see various features and details. Apparently, they do not always orbit at the same altitude. \n\n6. It is quite possible to combine imagery from platforms such as multiple satellites, planes, high altitude balloons, etc. to improve resolution considerably. It is hard to know the extent to which this is done, or if it is done, because of course the area is shrouded in secrecy, so we do not know. But the question was, how detailed CAN it be? Well you COULD use multiple sensors on multiple platforms, unlike the Hubble telescope (in fact, multiple sensors on the ground are able to beat Hubble now). \n \n7. As a gross upper bound on resolution limits, look at the mutually agreed upon limits on size of warheads etc by the Russians/FSU/USSR and the USA, for example (typically, the silo doors would reportedly be opened to permit treaty inspections, according to newspaper accounts anyway). These specifications in the treaties imply MUCH higher resolution than the some of the numbers given here by others. And remember, these are the mutually agreed-upon resolutions by two very suspicious adversaries, who do not want to give anything away. Both have to be able to achieve these resolutions, and probably are capable of far better resolution. \n\n8. Having looked at Dawe's limit, and knowing a bit about resolution, I can tell you that it is not particularly useful as an indicator of achievable resolution. How close we are able to come to ultimate resolutions depends on how many resources we are willing to spend, and again since it is classified, it is difficult to know.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question how detailed can satellite imagery be? The answer is, VERY. How detailed is it? We do not know, since it is classified."
"Is there any general information about the North Star?
Not just about one thing. All about the North Star.
The North Star is a title of the star best suited for navigation northwards. A candidate must be visible from Earth and circumpolar to the north celestial pole. The current one is Polaris. It is the star at the end of the ""handle"" of the constellation Ursa Minor.\n\nThe North Star has been historically used by explorers to determine their latitude. At any point north of the equator the angle from the horizon to the North Star (its altitude) is the same as the latitude from which that angle was taken. For example, the angle to the North Star for a person at 30° latitude will be about 30°.\n\nPolaris has a visual magnitude of only 1.97. On the other hand, in 3000 BC the faint star Thuban in the constellation Draco was the North Star; and at magnitude 3.67 it is five times fainter than Polaris. The bright Vega will be the North Star by AD 14,000. In comparison the brightest star, Sirius, has a magnitude of −1.46 (assuming that we exclude the Sun at −26.8).\n\nCurrently, there is no South Star as useful as Polaris; the faint star σ Octantis is closest to the south celestial pole. However, the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, points towards the south pole."

"have red bumps all over my legs and slowly spreading. skin rritation?

It could be several things...are the bumps oily or seepy -- could be an encounter with poison ivy or poison oak.  However if you have recently been in the woods or in contact with leaves (like raking leaves) you may have chiggers (yes they are real).  They are a little mite that buries in your skin, and migrate very rapidly, they are extremely irritating and itchy -- but they are not life threatening.  What can you do -- not much...they eventually have to suffocate...so best to treat the area with a corticosteroid cream or ointment for the itching and symptoms. You don't give enough details to know -- so you can always go to a good source such as webmd.  If you suspect chiggers -- on your next outing be sure to wear long pants, long sleeves, and tight fitting clothes.  You often find people getting exposed on those ""indian summer days"" where you are dressed a little more lightly and contact trees, leaves, or bark (sitting on a log) a bunch.  \n\nIt the rash persists for awhile or gets worse -- you should seek medical attention."

I want to build mostly my upper body and abdominal area. Basically get ripped. I have a bowflex and love to use it. I just need a good workout routine like how many reps and weight. And whats good to take to help like creatine, whey etc.
The Bowflex is an awesome workout- very good at isolating muscle groups.  Work the areas you want to build not more than three times per week.  The muscle fibers need time to heal.  During weight resistance, muscle fibers are pulled apart until some fibers break (the burning feeling).  Over the next 48 hours, the fibers heal and new muscle fills in the gap.  Do at least three sets up to 15 reps.  Once you reach 15 reps increase the resistance.\n\nDiet is important, but I'm not a big fan of supplements.  Go high protein and low fat.  Lots of chicken, egg whites, fish, lean meat (try loins - sirloin, tenderloin, loin chops)."

"What exactly is a pyramid scheme?

A pyramid scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves the exchange of money primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, usually without any product or service being delivered. Pyramid schemes have existed for at least a century. In addition, other methods of conducting business known as multi-level marketing (MLM) and as ""matrix schemes"" often closely resemble pyramid schemes (although unlike pyramid schemes, which are almost always frauds, MLM and matrix schemes are in many cases regarded — at least legally — as legitimate business methods).\n\nMost pyramid schemes are attempts to confuse potential consumers into complicated but convincingly fool-proof money making scams. The essential idea behind each scam is that the individual only makes one payment, but somehow they are promised to receive exponential benefits from other people as a reward. A common example might be that a victim is enticed with an offer that, for a fee, allows them to sell the same offer to other people. Each sale includes a fee to the original seller. Clearly, the fundamental flaw is that there is no end benefit; the money simply travels up the chain, and only the originator wins in swindling his followers. Furthermore, the people in the worst situation are the ones at the bottom of the pyramid: those who subscribed to the plan, but were not able to accrue any followers themselves. To embellish the act, most such scams will have fake referrals, testimonials, and information.\n\nAlthough pyramid schemes have been declared illegal in many countries, they still persist in various forms."

"how is it possible for a rock (earth) to create a atmosphere .?
and keep all the radiation out after all its just water with some dirt and bed rock.its as if it were alive.
It is possible for the earth to hold an atmosphere due to its gravitational field.  All objects (of any size) are attracted to other objects (of any size) this is called gravity.  The earth's gravitational field therefore holds the oxygen, nitrogen, etc. inside its gravitational field because due to its size its gravity pulls the oxygen molecules to it.  This is also reason why there is more oxygen air etc.  at sea level than in the mountains.  As you ascend higher the gravity is less than at sea level so less air is held by gravity."

I've tried it before but I can only do it when I'm asleep. Just wondering how many people do the real deal and not just the sleep kind. How many months does it take to get down? What's the best way to learn how to do it? Reading? I'd really like to learn this because when I have vivid astral projection dreams it's great but I want the real deal...
I think Dr. Stephen Strange could help you with that. You should look him up.\n:)"
"Do you believe that Vampires really exist?

Vampires in the classic sense don't exist. They evolved from many different cultures as a means t cope with death and horrible things. Society creats monsters to cope with what it cannot understand. In rural vilages in the 9th century the myths were strong about the dead coming back to life, etc. But we know that the blood sucking, bat loving, coffin sleeping vampires just cannot be.\n\nAs someone mentioned, someone could be a physic vampire. Thsi is just someone who for malicious intent can sap your energy by saying and doing the right things. it is not special power, but a term used to describe someone who thrves making chaos around them"
"Why should we be held accountable for believing in God?
In Christianity, if you do not believe in God, you are sent to hell, right? But how are we supposed to know that God is real? I mean, a bunch of people tell me all the time that God is real, but how am I supposed to know they aren't lying? After all, other people in other religions tell people that theirs is correct, so how are we supposed to decide which one to believe? The Bible is a piece of evidence, but how do I know it wasn't written by people who just wanted to tell an entertaining story? There are many books in other religions too. I feel like if I die and talk to God, he might say ""There were many signs that you should have seen"", and then I'd say ""Well, all I saw were a bunch of people telling me about you, but people lie all the time, and we can never know if anyone is telling the truth, or if anyone is right about something that can't be tested"". It seems like we shouldn't be held accountable for believing something that has no more apparent validity than other theories.
Jesus told us very clearly about God, and that he is REAL, many people question Jesus as the son of God, but all those miracles he performed were to prove it. so, as he is telling the truth, there is a God. You need faith."
"Not knowing you have Lyme disease, Could a mother transmit the disease to her unborn child ?
My daughter is 18 years old and told she has Lyme disease.  Is it possible that I could be a carrier and gave it to her?  She was a normal healthy baby 9lbs 7ozs.  Normal childhood.  I breastfeed her for 6 weeks.
Actually, both previous posts are wrong. Lyme's disease is transmitted by a bacteria called a spirochete, and it can actually be carried across the placenta. So if it is present in the mother's bloodstream, it can be transmitted to the fetus before birth.\n\nAfter birth though, the baby would have to acquire it through the usual fashion, that is via the aforementioned tick bite."
"what does an astronomer do?  ; can u tell me 10 words or more on astronomy?(preferbly 11)?

Astronomy:\nAstronomy (Greek: αστρονομία = άστρον + νόμος, astronomia = astron + nomos, literally, ""law of the stars"") is the science of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere, such as stars, planets, comets, auroras, galaxies, and the cosmic background radiation. It is concerned with the formation and development of the universe, the evolution and physical and chemical properties of celestial objects and the calculation of their motions. Astronomical observations are not only relevant for astronomy as such, but provide essential information for the verification of fundamental theories in physics, such as general relativity theory. Complementary to observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics seeks to explain astronomical phenomena.\n\nAstronomy is one of the oldest sciences with a scientific methodology existing at the time of ancient Greece and advanced observation techniques possibly much earlier (see archaeoastronomy). Historically, amateurs have contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, and astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.\n\nModern astronomy as practised is not to be confused with astrology, the belief system that states that people's destiny and human affairs in general are correlated to the positions of celestial objects in the skies. Although the two fields share a common origin, they are quite different; astronomers employ the scientific method, while astrologers do not.\n\nAstronomer:\nAstronomers are scientists who study objects in outer space. There are \ntwo main types of astronomers - observers and theorists, although most \nastronomers are a mix of both. Observers are astronomers who take \npictures of the sky through telescopes. These pictures may be taken in \nordinary visible light, or they may be pictures of radio waves, or of \nx-rays, or any other type of light. Some observers even look for \nhigh-energy particles called cosmic rays which come from deep space. \nObservers then take these pictures (and whatever other information they \nmay collect) and try to determine what they saw, and what that tells us \nabout the universe.\nTheorists are astronomers who try and explain what observers see, \nand even predict objects that might exist that we have not or cannot see. \nTheorists use mathematics and physics to explain how the universe works. \nThey often use giant, powerful computers to solve complicated math problems.\nTheorists and observers work together to try and explain \neverything from the dust that makes up meteors to the structure of the \nentire universe. They try and explain how stars and galaxies are born, \nlive, and die.\n\nI hope this gives you better idea about both of them."
"what exactly is 'cell respiration'?
does anyone have a simple explantation because i'm confused!!
Cell Respiration is the process by which the chemical energy of ""food"" molecules is released and partially captured in the form of ATP. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuels in cellular respiration, but glucose is most commonly used as an example to examine the reactions and pathways involved."
"so the world is 6000 years old is it?
So did the devil plant dinosaur fossils to lead us from the truth?\nOr scrub the pyramids clean of flood damage? not to mention keeping the egyptions alive.\nThe great temple is also 5000 years old so in 1000 years adam and eve populated the world and they developed all the crafts necasery to build monumental structures.\nAnd what kind of a god asks you to be blind and ignorent to what you see?! \nI'm a Christian, but come on!

Is this 2006? or is it before Renaissance?\nMight I mention a few things: radio carbon dating, cosmic background radiation, speed of light, distance of some galaxies from us, the time to form heavy elements from hydrogen, half life of uranium...\nI think any one of these things will prove the age of the earth. Incidentally, the Hindu scriptures, Vedas are about 6000 years old. The last ice age ended 13000 years ago...\n\nI can't believe these same people boast about space travel. LMFAO.\n\nIncidentally for the person who said something about matter and energy. No matter and energy can't be created or destroyed. Matter and energy are actually the same thing in different forms. One is a more stable form, the other is a transient form.\n\nAnd the person who said the Bible is the truth. Well the bible didn't arrive by fax from heaven. It was written by men. The laws of physics, on the other hand, was written by God. Scientists merely discover them."
"how much gold is in the world?

Gold in antiquity was relatively easy to obtain geologically; however, 75% of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910.[2] It has been estimated that all the gold in the world that has ever been refined would form a single cube 20 m (66 ft) a side.\n\nInterestingly, the World Book Encyclopedia we had when I was a kid, copyright about 1960, said 44 ft cube."
"Do you know  this so called stripper diet? when u eat Baby food and Ensure?? what is it?PLEASE EXPLAIN?

It's called the stripper diet because it's popular among many strippers in New Orleans.  I am familiar with it because my friend Brandy (yes she's a stripper) uses it before she has a big party or before she goes on ""tour"".  Basically, it is what it sounds.  All you eat for like two weeks is baby food and drink ensure.  It's EXTREMELY unhealthy."
"Hypothesis Testing?
Can anyone out there do this, because I'm really stuck?\n\nThe new cable and TV channel Channel#6 is keen to establish what opinion the viewing public have of its sunday night films.  It has undertaken a survey of 100 subscribers and found that 70 like it and 30 don't.\n\nAssuming a constant proportion (in the recent survey) of 70% liking the sunday films, how large a sample is required to detect at 99.5% level that the proportion of subscribers liking the sunday night films has risen from an earlier proportion of 60%?
The test statistic for testing one sample proportion is\n\nz = (phat-p)/sqrt(p(1-p)/n)\n\nNow phat = 0.7 since that value came from your sample.  We'll assume that proportion carries through regardless of the sample size.\np = 0.6 since that what you would assume the value is in the null hypothesis.\nz = 2.576.  Now you said 99.5% level.  I'm assuming you mean a 0.5% significance level from that.  On the standard normal, 0.5% is found above 2.576\n\nSo plug all of those values in and solve for n\n\n2.576 = (0.7-0.6)/sqrt(0.6*0.4/n)\n2.576sqrt(0.24/n) = 0.1\nsqrt(0.24/n) = 0.1/2.576 = 0.0388\n0.24/n = 0.0388^2 = 0.00151\nn/0.24 = 1/0.00151 = 663.5776\nn = 663.5776*0.24 = 159.258624\n\nWhich you should round up every time.  You would need a sample size of 160 to make that determination."
"I need some sincere answers....I am the divorced daddy of a 16 year old girl. The girl lives wit( see deiails)
My 16 year old lives with he mother and her mother's live in boy-friend. They have started permitting the girl to go over to the girl's boyfriend's house on the week-end and she spends the night with him and they DO sleep in the same bed. The boy-friend, whom I have never met, is 19 years of age and in the Army and he comes home on the week-end. I am suppose to have visitation with her on the week-end but she hasn't been over here in a long time. Do you think this is right? I do pay child support and I am not the kind of dad who doesn't care!!
this sound similar to what I went through. THe only difference is that my dad didn't step in. I pretty much grew up making mistates and learning from them on my own. I don,t recommend this at all. Get involved with her. Don't punish cause at this age they think that parents don't know any thing. Try to spend quality time with her and gradually talk about whats going on in her life. Remind her that you love her and want the best for her. Let her know that for any reason, you are there for her. Somewhere in your conversations ask her about her boyfriend. Even if you have to pretend, make her think that you see where she is coming from. 16 year olds need to know that their dad will be there for all of their life, even the mistakes. My dad just pretty much let me live and learn. I think I turned out o.k. but I still wish I would of had the guidance from my dad. My mom died when I was 10 and it was really hard for him, but he did not seek help. I really hope that things get worked out. Don't give up and try your best to be involved with your CHILD. She is still your child. The mom needs a good talking to. She is alot of the reason that your daughter is doing what she is doing. Explain your concerns and she is you can meet in the middle some where or at least come to some understanding on why this is not appropriate. She has alot of influence on her. Good luck.  Contact me and let me know how it goes."
"Im a 55 year old married woman, still get my period, and sometimes pass clots during it, is this normal?

"Does any one know anything about sun poison? My little bro' has it and I am curious to find out.?
Anything about it would be helpful, thanx.
Sun poisoning is most likely to occur during hot seasons when ultraviolet light is strongest. It's triggered by exposure to the sun, usually combined with sunburn. It's especially likely in children who take medications that cause photosensitivity. The most common drugs include tetracycline antibiotics, thiazide diuretics, sulfa drugs, and oral contraceptives. It's not a precursor to skin cancer, so don't worry. Of course, long-term exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer, but just because you get sun poisoning doesn't mean your'e going to get cancer."

"Will there be ice cream in hell?
As I understand it, the vast majority of us, probably myself included, will be going to Hell due to our not having chosen the correct religion.\n\nHell is generally described as an unpleasantly hot place.  I've always found that the best thing to do on an unpleasantly hot day is to eat a nice big bowl of ice cream.\n\nSo, this leads to the obvious question: will there be ice cream in hell?\n\nI sure hope so.  And while I normally prefer chocolate, I think a fruit flavored sherbet would be quite refreshing in all that scorching heat.
no but maybe multiflavored milk! ya know when it melts."
"In retail, why is there a huge gap in the wages between pharmacy techs and pharmacists?
This bothers me despite the fact that technicians do most of the major work in the pharmacy.
The techs do a lot of the labor in terms of filling the scripts, pulling the meds, entering scripts in the computer, etc. but the pharmacist takes all the responsibility.  if you mess up a script (put the wrong medicine in the bottle, fill a prescription that shouldn't be filled due to an interaction or unusual SIG, etc.) and the script gets handed to somebody, the pharmacist will take the fall, not the tech, not even the MD who wrote it.  also, the pharmacist is supposed to counsel the patients on any new Rx, explaining how the med works, why the patient should take the med, how it should be taken, the side effects, etc.  it may seem like you're doing a lot of the work, but all you need to do to be a tech is graduate high school and take a test.  the pharmacist went to college for 4 years then graduate school for 4 years to become a licensed pharmacist.  if you're unhappy about technician pay (which I agree is way too low in most places) then think about going to pharmacy school, you're in good position to do so if you're already a technician."

"what is the most eastern state in the united states?

ALASKA\n\nFascinatingly, Alaska is the state that is farthest north, east, and west while Hawaii is farthest south. The reason that Alaska is farthest east and west is due to the fact that the Aleutian Islands cross the 180° meridian of longitude, placing some of the islands actually in the Eastern Hemisphere and thus degrees east of Greenwich (and the Prime Meridian)."
"wich type of cheese moldes the fastest?
chedder,swiss,peper jack or colby jack cheese
Cheese is a product made by introducing mold to milk fat, so it is all moldy when you get it.  Blue Cheese has the mold visible when you buy it (It's the blue part), so I guess you could say it ""molds the fastest,"" since it contains visible mold when you buy it.

"Competitor offers job, then freezes offer and then reactivates the offer...?
A similar company (automotive financing) offers me a job for a 15% raise (same job basically).  When I'm about to resign to change jobs, they call me to say that they are freezing all hirings. A month later they call back to check if I'm still available and say they need me right away. Asked them for a two-year golden parachute and they said no can do. The change would imply longer working hours, longer commuting time, less vacation days but better prospectives in a more solid company.  Would you trust them?
Without the ""golden parachute"" and an employment contract that provides for job security and regular raises and termination only for ""moral turpitude"", your answer should be ""no can do"".\n\nI think that they are merely offering you a short term position to extract whatever knowledge you have about your current employer's policies, practices, and clients."

I really think most diet and energy pills are a scam.  It is still possible to lose weight effectively without those things.  I suggest going to a track somewhere and walk a lap jog a lap, and repeat this as much as you can.  Start slow and gradually move your way up.  If you cant jog a full lap just try your best.  Dont drink soda, and stay away from fast food.  Just dont snack alot eat decent meals but nothing inbetween.  Light weight training would also be a great help.  I promise if you do these simple things at a moderate pace you will see a difference in two weeks!"
"i want to learn how to draft business letters?
myself workimg in an office and want to learn how to draft business letters without anybodies help.
Here are a few practical writinghelp-central.com letter writing tips that you may find helpful when writing that next letter:\n\n   1. Keep it short and to the point.\n      Letters involving business (personal or corporate) should be concise, factual, and focused. Try to never exceed one page or you will be in risk of losing your reader. A typical letter page will hold 350 to 450 words. If you can’t get your point across with that many words you probably haven’t done enough preparatory work. If necessary, call the recipient on the phone to clarify any fuzzy points and then use the letter just to summarize the overall situation.\n\n   2. Focus on the recipient’s needs.\n      While writing the letter, focus on the information requirements of your audience, the intended addressee. If you can, in your “mind’s eye” imagine the intended recipient seated across a desk or boardroom table from you while you are explaining the subject of the letter. What essential information does that person need to know through this communication? What will be their expectations when they open the letter? Have you addressed all of these?\n\n   3. Use simple and appropriate language.\n      Your letter should use simple straightforward language, for clarity and precision. Use short sentences and don’t let paragraphs exceed three or four sentences. As much as possible, use language and terminology familiar to the intended recipient. Do not use technical terms and acronyms without explaining them, unless you are certain that the addressee is familiar with them.\n\n   4. Re-read and revise it.\n      Do a first draft of the letter, and then carefully review and revise it. Put yourself in the place of the addressee. Imagine yourself receiving the letter. How would you react to it? Would it answer all of your questions? Does it deal with all of the key issues? Are the language and tone appropriate? Sometimes reading it out loud to one’s self, can be helpful. When you actually “hear” the words it is easy to tell if it “sounds” right, or not.\n\n   5. Check spelling and grammar.\n      A letter is a direct reflection of the person sending it, and by extension, the organization that person works for. When the final content of the letter is settled, make sure that you run it through a spelling and grammar checker. Sending a letter with obvious spelling and grammar mistakes looks sloppy and unprofessional. In such cases, the recipient can’t really be blamed for seeing this as an indication as to how you (and your organization) probably do most other things."
"Koran claims that all ""jews"" considered Ezra as son of a God. That is news to most Jews. Was Koran Wrong??
Prophet Mohammed just wanted to find execuses to fight Jews and Christians. Yes, Christians believe that Jesus is the son of God, but the story about Ezra, for the most part, is a big lie...Or God is a lier, or Mohammed is a false prophet....
The Jews call `Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah.... ....This phrase comes directly from Koran. It is obviuos that Mohamad wrote the Koran, not God. the Jews means all jews, just like the christians means all christians. I dont think God made such a big mistake....Koran never said some of the Jews, or some of the Christians. He clearly meant ALL....."

"How much water do you drink per day?

"can i file bankruptcy if i have lien on my house and debts?
There is a lien on my house. I would like to file bankruptcy. Any suggestions on how to doing this?
Talk with an attorney.  There might be a way you could still come out of bankruptcy with something left.  You didn't say why you want to go bankrupt.  Do you owe more than $65,000?  If there is a way that you can not file bankruptcy then I suggest that you do not file for bankruptcy.  Do you have relatives you could live with if you lose the house?  Usually if you have a lien then any money that's taken from your pay or from what has been sold that you own first goest to paying the lien on the house.  Debts on the other hand, well you can go to Consulter Credit Counseling who can remove the interest, close your accounts, and help you pay down those bills if you have a job.  Right now there are a lot of part time jobs so you can get a second job for the holiday season and don't buy anything more.  Cut off your cable, get rid of your cell phones, and if things get really tight then sell your expensive car if you have one and get a clunker for a while till you recover.  If there are others in your family they could get jobs too.  And, if you can still have the house for a while longer then maybe you can rent out a room by the week (ask for church attenders who need a room to stay over the holidays).  But first you need to figure out how much time you have left on the house before it goes into foreclosure.  Best of luck to you."
"why is the sky blue?

first off the sky isn't blue because it a reflection off the water...actually the water is blue because it a reflection of the sky...(i hate it when people answer this question by saying the ocean)\n\nthis is an answer given by ""stapl3r2006"" for this exact same question 3 weeks ago...i cheated because i didn't want to type the whole thing out (i clicked and dragged)(it is the best description that i have seen on this site)...have fun\n\n\nThe blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.\n\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white"

1, 2, and 3 are just ridiculous.  razors??  LOL, whatever.  Men CAN marry 4 women, but they need the first wife's permission and are told it's better to marry just one since men by their very nature have a hard time being fair and just with just one.  4, I have been to islamic countries.  you are sadly misinformed.  My nephews and nieces there have regular schoolbooks, and study the Quran for only an hour a day in their home when an Imam comes to teach them how to read arabic.  5, all of this is against islam.  Whipping is commanded for adulterors only, and that's it.  6, internet is all over the islamic countries too.  internet wasn't even INVENTED in those days, so there can't be any issue with it.  It's also a great educational tool and many of those same people can get an education online.  7, again you are sadly misinformed.  They have everything we have.  My father in law has a toyota corolla with all leather interior and little pillows on each headrest both in front and back.  Not to mention a great AC system.  8, doctors and other people of those fields are used over there, too.  What, do you think they don't have hospitals?  Of course they do, otherwise who else would have cured my daughter of Yellow Fever?  We went into the hospital, and across from where the maternity ward is, there was the children's area.

Real religion or cult?\n\nhttp://www.mutantnation.com/underground/cults/Scientology.asp
Its a cult, once you join they wont let you leave. Also it costs you lots of money.\n\nThey have something called auditing, where you supposed to reflect who is a makes you unhappy (this includes your parents , brothers sisters, friends etc.) and you should not longer have anything to do with them.

"Would you like to be immortal? Why/why not?

It depends on the basis of the immortality.  If I am an old man, incapable of walking, eating, and breathing on my own and just laying in a bed unable to die, I would not choose such a life.  If i were to remain healthy, young, and able while everyone else grew old and died, I would bear the responsibilities of my position to society as the person who would be able to go on living and teaching others, etc.  If I were able to be immortal and so were everyone else, that would be a rockin good time."

Try eating foods high in antioxidants.  Antioxidants help to remove free radicals from the body.

"can toxic shock syndrome be considered an accident?
if someone goes to the dentist and dies of toxic shock syndrome can this be cinsidered an accident?
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an uncommon but potentially serious illness that occurs when poisonous substances (toxins) produced by certain bacteria enter the bloodstream. The toxins cause a type of blood poisoning caused by staphylococcal, or less commonly streptococcal, infections in the lungs, throat, skin or bone, or from injuries. Women using super-absorbent tampons during menstruation were found to be most likely to get toxic shock syndrome."
"Why do Americans follow the ""Adkins diet?""?
Dr. Adkins died a fat man...do I really need to say more? Carbs=energy...do people really want to not have energy? I know several people that followed high-carb diets and lost weight! They weren't lethargic either...
I am not going to acknowledge the how Dr. Atkins died.  However, I will say that if you read and learn about the WHOLE concept behind the Atkins low carb lifestyle, you will see that it works and understand the science behind it.\n\nMost people just want a quick fix and associate the induction phase of Atkins as the entire diet.  There are different phases that you go through as you progress.\n\nAtkins and all diets are about eating the right foods. Foods consist of either carbohydrates, protien or fat. Eating the right mix of these is the key.\n\nAtkins advocates controlling the intake of carbs and eating the right fats. There are different types of carbs depending on the absorption rate into the blood stream. There is a tool called the glycemic index to help you determine the absorption rate. Typically, the lower the rate the better. See the source below.\n\nI used the Atkins approach and lost 60 pounds. I still live the low carb lifestyle and have maintained my weight for over two years.\n\nUltimately, it is about calories taken in and burned. Regardless of which diet you choose, you should get on some sort of a light exercise plan. Changing your diet will help you lose weight. However, exercise and diet will jump start it.\n\nI would recommend doing some research for yourself. You should have a full understanding of any diet plan. For any diet to be effective, it has to be a lifestyle change. I would also consult a doctor before starting for a general checkup and bloodwork. This way you can compare your results later down the road."
"How did scientists arrive at 9.8 m/s/s as the acceleration for gravity?
Did they use a special tool or equipment? Or did they just made some valid assumption through experiments?
Measurements. The acceleration of gravity is:\ng = G*m/R^2\nWhere G is the gravitational constant 6.67*10^-11 N*m^2/s^2, m is the mass of the planet, and R is the distance between yourself and the planet. For the surface of the Earth, m and R are approximately:\nMe = 5.97*10^24 kg\nRe = 6.38*10^6 m\nUsing this, you should get about 9.8 m/s^2."
"why do the age and depth of the Emperor Seamount Chain increase from south to north?

The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain is composed of the Hawaiian Ridge, consisting of the islands of the Hawaiian chain northwest to Kure Atoll, and the Emperor Seamounts, a vast underwater mountain region of islands and intervening seamounts, atolls, shallows, banks and reefs along a line trending southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean. The seamount chain, containing over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches over 3,600 miles from the Aleutian Trench in the far northwest Pacific to Lo‘ihi seamount, the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about 35 km southeast of the Island of Hawai‘i. It is considered the largest mountain chain in the world. The Hawaiian Islands are that portion of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain that projects above sea level.\n\nIn 1963, geologist John Tuzo Wilson hypothesized the origins of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain explaining that they were created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that was essentially stationary as the Pacific tectonic plate drifted in a northwesterly direction, leaving a trail of increasingly eroded volcanic islands and seamounts in its wake. An otherwise inexplicable kink in the chain would mark a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction, and the kink has been presented in geology texts as an example of how a tectonic plate can shift direction comparatively suddenly. More recent studies, mentioned below, provide evidence that the change in direction may have occurred over a period of about 8 million years.\n\nHowever, more recent analysis of the magnetization orientation of cooling magnetite in ancient lava flows taken at four seamounts shows a more complex relationship than the textbook stationary hotspot offered. If the hot spot had remained above a fixed mantle plume during the past 80 million years, the latitude as determined by the orientation of the magnetite should be constant for each sample and should also signify original cooling at the same latitude as the current Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nA recent interpretation of the magnetization, that the hotspot itself also actually drifted southward between 81 and 47 million years ago, is causing geologists to rethink their model of the interior workings of the Earth (Roach 2003).\n\nYet more recently published argon-argon ages of rocks from volcanoes of the southern and central Emperor chain better establish the age at which the bend formed. Sharp and Clague (2006) determined that the bend initiated at about 50 million years ago, and the bending continued until about 42 million years ago. They also concluded that the bend formed because of the ""traditional"" reason -- a change in the direction of motion of the Pacific plate.\n\nReferences:\nNational Geographic News: John Roach, ""Hot Spot That Spawned Hawaii Was on the Move, Study Finds"": August 14, 2003 \nWarren D. Sharp and David A. Clague, 50-Ma initiation of Hawaiian-Emperor bend records major change in Pacific Plate motion. Science, v. 313, p. 1281-1284 (2006)."
"I want to get a massage but...?
I am extremely hairy... any suggestions?
I am going to answer this as a professional, licensed massage therapist, in hopes that your question is about massage therapy. It should not be a problem for you at all if you are going to a professional, licensed massage therapist. We are use to all sorts of body types and we know how to adjust techniques, pressure, the amount of oil, etc. for each situation. In the event you have a therapist that is ""pulling"" the hair or whatever so that it is uncomfortable, tell them so they can make adjustments. That goes for anything else, too. If the room is too hot, cold, you hate the music or it's too loud, the pressure is too much, whatever. Just keep the communication line open with your therapist because we can't read your mind, and we can't feel what you are feeling! (Also, a good therapist will tell you this, too!). Now, go out and get a massage because it's one of the best things you can do for yourself!!!!!   ; )"

"i think i am overweight?
all of my friends are bigger than me so they always say i am skinny but i think i am overweight and i need to lose a little weight b/4 school starts back please help me and give me some tips!!! :P
The quickest way is to cut out red meats, starches, breads, sugars, alcohal, and sodas.\n\nEat veggies (salads are good), soups, and drink TONS of water. If you get hungry between a meal, drink water to fill up.\n\nIn moderation eat white meats, and fruits (fruits contain natural sugars, and that can put on weight)\n\nPractice portion control. Yes, you'll feel hungry at first, but think of your goal, and soon your stomach will start shrinking and you won't have that feeling anymore.\n\nEat 5 times a day. A small breakfast. A mid-morning snack, such as an apple. A small lunch. A mid-afternoon snack, such as carrots. A lite dinner. Do not eat any later than 7pm (6pm is better.)\n\nGo exercise for at least an hour a day, incorporating weight training. Weight training builds muscle. Muscle burns fat. You get the idea.\n\nGood luck!!"

"Why do scientists use BC and AD for years though most don't beleive in things dealin with Jesus Christ?
I have read several articles and other things that talk about the past, present, and future in terms of years.  If the vast majority of scientists don't believe that God created the universe why would they believe in Jesus?  \n\nIf BC means before christ and AD means after death why use them if their beliefs lead elseware?  I understand that these acronyms have been used for a long time.  With that being said it would be hard to change the worlds view on this.  \n\nSo who first thought of using BC/AD as a way to define years?  Could this person have been religious and among the community it took hold?  I am religious and so I am just curious.\n\nWhy wouldn't time just begin and continue.  It starts and then it stops on a year, and from then on is called AD.  So After death, Wow!  Someone must have been important to consider all years from the point of his death to AD.  The points before that are also noticed as the came before he did.  \n\nAnyone want to expand or speak your peace?
ANNO DOMINI) is the Roman expression for: The year of the dominium of the Lord. This is to say that the ""Lord"" as a title was given to the highest office of the Roman Empire. At that time this was Julius Caesar and it related to any year he was in office. \n\nThere was a gate in Jerusalem, that had the statue of Caesar posted at the gate. It was expected that the Jews come into the city through that gate and pay their respect to the statue as their Lord and Master. After all, the Romans occupied the territory at that time, and also ruled over the Jews. The Jews avoided that gate like the plague, because they would have not been able to keep the commandment: 'Thou shall not worship other Idols..' The Christians did not have this problem. \n\nChristianity really was promoted in Greece and spread from there. Remember that the world as it was known AT THAT TIME, was mainly ruled by Julius Caesar, and anything that was Roman was also in fashion. That is why the ANNO DOMINI was simply transferred to the God of the Christians by the Christians of that time as THEIR Lord. \n\nNow, ""B.C."" stands for any year ""BEFORE CAESAR"". This is to say the Romans could not care less what came BEFORE CAESAR, and remember, the Romans ruled! Again, Christianity saw this as a golden opportunity to make this one of their own significance, by simply changing it to ""Before Christ."" Since the Greek word for king is ""Christos"", it fit. The Roman word REX or the Hebrew word MELEG would not have worked. \n\nAt that time the Christian movement was a small and insignificant sect. No one can seriously believe that the Roman Empire would have fixed something as important as the accounting of historic time and events to the Christian movement, especially if it was centered around a Jew to whom the Greek title of king was assigned, and whom they had crucified for rebellion against their own. \n\nI think you would have to go to the library and look up works about Roman periods, especially under Julius Caesar. It was he who was determined to be worshiped as IDOL (GOD) by all nations of his time, especially those nations that he had conquered, and where his troops occupied the land. His role was not simply to rule, but to DOMINATE, hence DOMINI, and not simply a number of some sort of keeping track of time. Anything B.C (Before Caesar) did not matter to him one way or another. It was also coined to play down the achievements of Alexander the Great, (356-323 B.C) who was still in the people's mind at that time."

"What do you do during art therapy?
I am going to do a trial study at a pain management program, and I will be trying art therapy.\nI have bad pain in knees and joints, and I was wondering how this will help? And what will i do there?\nIt sounds fun!
I probably shouldn't tell you b/c if it is a study they want you to be a fairly clean slat without any preconceived notions about it. So, if you are interested in keeping your fresh perspective don't read any further.\n\nIt depends on the type (i.e., theoretical orientation) of art therapy you will be doing.  It most likely is being used as either a distraction technique (which is not novel) and/or as a mood enhancing technique. There is considerable research that demonstrates that pain experience can be mediated by an individuals emotional health. This is not to say that your emotions cause the pain, but rather that your emotions can either cause to experience greater levels of physical pain or actually reduce your pain experience.  There are other orientations that will attempt to use the art work as a means of abstracting your ""intrapsychic"" issues; however, this type of psychology is losing favor as little research has ever supported it's accuracy and utility."
"what  satisfaction gives u when u smoke???
i want someone to quit smoking...
The satisfaction is two fold. First its an addiction. When you smoke, you get a craving for the niccotine.  and you get nervous in a way. Its not a horrible feeling, just like you need to smoke....is the only way I can explain it. Also I think its a really powerful habbit. It always keeps your hand occupied. So whenever you are in a social situation, or driving, you just get used to having something to figit with. So it feels like you should be smoking because thats what you are used to."
"My friend is a cutter. How do I approach her about self mutilation?
I have a friend who recently contacted me after we had not seen each other for quite some time. She has told me about how she ""used to"" cut herself and is into experiencing some moderate pain during sex with her boyfriend. Today, I saw some sort of beads or something sticking outy of her neck. When I asked her what it was and if I could see it, she wouldnt tell me what it was, nor would she let me look at it again. I think she and her boyfriend are into some strange sex ritual involving mutilation, and obviously some strage shit involving sticking needles into her and leaving them there. Can anyone tell me about this? What is the bahavior called, why do people do it, what are the risks, is there hope for her? How do I approach her to talk about it? Any help anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.
Okay, as for the cutting, that is sometimes a relief from some type of anxiety or pain in your life.  Cutting allows people to have control rather than the real pain they have which a person cannot control.  As for the self-mutilation, some people are into that.  It is not necessarily a bad thing although it could lead to infections and rarely something more serious.  \n\nI think the best thing is to let her come to you when she is comfortable unless you see it going out of hand.  The minor things are not necessarily horrible although to most people it would seem that way.  If it bothers you too much you may want to bring it up and talk with her about it and see if she will open up more to you.\n\nI was a cutter!"
"how does feminism effect the work enviorment?

Makes it tense, especially if a ""feminist"" is a boss.  Some people have no sense of humor, no sense of proportion, sometimes not even a sense of fairness.  If people get hooked on thinking of themselves in categories, and the category gets defined as ""oppressed,"" they forget they are individuals who are individually responsible for their own actions.  To me, that's what feminism is.\n\nOne of the big names in the so-called Women's Movement was Betty Friedan.  Many years ago, she wrote a magazine article which was titled ""Feminism Implies Socialism.""  I saw the title, agreed that it was so, and gave up ""feminism"" for life.  But it is true; if you are a feminist, you are defining life in terms of broad categories of gender, and claiming ""reparations"" for past prejudice against your category.  That's just plain unfair!"

i can help with part of it. i forgot a lot of my chemistry stuff. so ok  first thing is to find the number of mols of each reactant put in. which is  mass over molar mass. and then find the molar mass of 0.566g of H2. so you know how many moles of H2 are left over, so you should lknow how many moles reacted and you should know the number of mols of the other 2 substances too and you know the volume and you can figure out the masses so then   do that. \nand Kc is just the  conc of products over reactants. if youre in AP   i assume you know how to do that\nthen c   and    um partial pressures. i think it has something to do with mole ratios and   the total pressure. im not completely sure, but im sure you can figure it out. good job"

Yes, it's use the isotope 135 I or 125 I to treat the thyroid cancer, because in this gland exist a very efficient transporter of Iodine called NIS.

"Could waste produced by nuclear power plants be dumped (gently) into an active volcanoe to get rid of it?

An active volcano is an upward current of molten rock. If you dumped radioactive waste into it, the parts that wouldn't be vaporized (and thereby spread through the atmosphere) would be thinned and distributed in the lava, spreading the problem rather than getting rid of it.\n\nWhat you might be thinking of is called a subduction zone, where two tectonic plates meet and one is pulled below the other. In that case, nuclear waste with a decay sufficiently low so that its earliest expected reappearance would lead to radiation levels below the average environmental level could be feasible. Getting the stuff into a deep cavern in a tectonically stable plate and leaving it there for about the same time would work at least as well, so I'd leave out tectonic activities when looking for an end storage for nuclear waste."

Well I don't know what jobs you've done in the past - perhaps they weren't very challenging.\n\nMaybe you need to write a list of the jobs you'd enjoy doing, or just stuff that you enjoy anyway - find out your passions then try to get a job in that field."

"What foods are good for boosting the metabolism?
I was wondering what foods are good for metabolism boosting and gives you energy.
yogurts and dairy foods definitely do not.  They are healthy foods in moderation, but they actually make people gain more weight.  They are good sources of calcium however.\n\n\nFoods with antioxidants are great, though, as well as certain citrus fruits.\n\nPommegranites, cranberries, and blueberries are the best.  These foods are also great for giving energy, loosing weight, and they help with slowing down the aging process."

"does circumcision make a penis more sensitive?
is a circumcised man more likely to orgasm faster than one who is not?
hi....well circumcision if done in childhood , makes the glans almost least sensitive to superficial touch when we grow adult...But if done in adulthood then surely you will have hard time as the exposed area shall give you so much pain..\n\nAs far as orgasm is considered, I feel that it should not ideally make any difference if one is circumcised or not...However many people who are circumcisied claim to hold for longer than those who still have fore-skin attached...But I guess that its more of hyped and rumor only as there is no technical study to proove that......I hope that you shall agree with me that there is no meter to measure the orgasm....so its soooo  difficult to answer it exactly..\nBut its also true that I have come across many people who claim that after they got circumcised ,they can do better or longer...coz their tool get lesser sensitive."

"who can prove 64=65?

i'll try. I gave this proof to two people already:\n\nTake any two ordinary constants. (e.g. x and y)\nMake them alike, as in x = y = any non-zero number (in this case, 1)\nMultiply each by y, but x works equally well (y²=xy).\nSubtract x² from each equation (y²-x² = xy-x²).\nFactor y²-x² into (y+x)(y-x) to make ((y-x)(y+x) = xy-x²).\nFactor xy-x² into x(y-x) to make ((y-x)(y+x) = x(y-x)).\nDivide by (y-x) to get (y+x=x).\nSubtract x from both sides of this equation to get y=0.\nThis means that y=0.\n\nBut since x = y = 1, then 1 = 0. If you multiply this equation by 64 on both sides, and then 65 on both sides, then you get 64 = 0 = 65, so therefore, 64 = 65."

"vacume distlation unit  and fire?

Water boils at 212F, at sea level!  If you boiled water at the top of a tall mountain the boiling temperature would be far less (and you need to cook food longer) because there is less atmospheric pressure to resist boiling.\n\nOnboard a large ship, fresh water is made from salty seawater in a distillation plant.  The seawater is heated using steam from the propulsion plant and the pressure in the distiller is lowered using an air ejector to promote boiling and evaporation which leaves the salt behind to be discharged as enriched brine.  The air ejector works similar to the squeeze bottle that dispenses perfume.  Squeezing the rubber bulb produces a high velocity air stream that passes over a dip tube creating a partial vacuum that sucks up the perfume to be atomized.  In the shipboard air ejector, live steam is passed through a narrowed Venturi tube to increase velocity and drops the pressure allowing any air to be entrained and removed from the evaporator and the pressure can be dropped further (in one or more stages) to cause the brine to flash to steam which can be removed and condensed (as pure water) using seawater as the coolant in a heat exchanger.  The pure water is used for hotel loads such as cooking and showers and drinking but large quantities are needed to make up for pure water loses from the propulsion plant.  Onboard ship, the evaporators are not directly fired but are in fact indirectly fired by the ship's furnace and boilers.\n\nOn land, electric heaters could be used to ""fire"" a distilling plant.  The term ""fire"" can be used for any heat source."

Chances are, the better your exercise program gets, the better you will sleep. Consider taking a melotonin pill to help you sleep (it's the natural substance your body produces that makes you tired).  The morning is the best time to exercise -- as exercise at night could prevent you from falling asleep.  Start slow and stick with it!"

"Why are high body temperatures potentially harmful?

Certain enzymes in our body denatures (changes shape) and becomes inactive when body temperature gets too high.  These enzymes are essential to human body because it is required to produce ATP (energy) that is needed by all cells in our body.  If the enzymes are allowed to stay denatured too long, it can result in permanent damage or death."
"how can i get away from suicidal thoughts?

Call some on this list that can help you!\nIf you kill yourself, your dead.  Then nobody can help you, you can't even help yourself.  My brother committed suicide.  Not the best option!\n\nSuicide: Don't let despair obscure other options\nDespair and hopelessness may lead you to think about suicide. But you have other options, from weathering an immediate crisis to creating a long-term safety plan.\n\nWhen life doesn't seem worth living anymore or your problems seem insurmountable, you may think that the only way to find relief is through suicide.\n\nYou might not believe it, but you do have other options — options to stay alive and feel better about your life. Maybe you think you've already tried them all and now you've had enough. Or maybe you think your family and friends would be better off without you.\n\nIt's OK to feel bad, but try to separate your emotions from your actions for the moment. Realize that depression, other mental disorders or long-lasting despair can distort your perceptions and impair your ability to make sound decisions. Suicidal feelings are the result of treatable illnesses. So try to act as if there are other options, even if you may not see them right now.\n\nNo, it probably won't be easy. You may not feel better overnight. Eventually, though, the sense of hopelessness can lift. You can find support, appropriate treatment and reasons for living.\nWhen you need immediate help for thoughts of suicide\n\nIf you're considering suicide right now and have the means available, talk to someone first. The best choice is to call 911 or your local emergency services number.\n\nIf you simply don't want to do that, for whatever reason, you have other choices for reaching out to someone:\n\n    * Contact a family member or friend\n    * Contact a doctor, mental health professional or other health care professional\n    * Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community\n    * Go to your local hospital emergency room\n    * Call a crisis center or hot line\n\nCrisis centers or suicide hot lines are often listed in the front of your phone book or on the Internet. They generally offer trained counselors — usually volunteers — who can help you through an immediate crisis. Some crisis centers with an Internet presence offer e-mail contact, but remember that responses may not be as prompt as they are with telephone support.\n\nTalking to someone about your feelings — connecting with someone — can help relieve the burden of despair and isolation, even if just temporarily. It may help you shift perspective and more clearly see that you have options beyond suicide.\nDaily coping strategies to manage thoughts of suicide\n\nYou may struggle with suicidal feelings frequently, perhaps many times a day. Develop a strategy to cope with those feelings in a healthy way. Consider asking a doctor, family member or friend to help create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.\n\n\nThat strategy may mean doing things you don't feel like doing, such as talking to friends when you'd rather hole up in your bedroom all day with the curtains drawn. Or it may mean going to the hospital for a mental health evaluation. But stick to your strategy, especially when you're in the grips of despair and hopelessness.\n\nAs part of your strategy, consider these measures:\n\n    * Keep a list of contact names and numbers readily available, including doctors, therapists and crisis centers.\n    * If your suicide plans include taking an overdose, give your medications to someone who can safeguard them for you and help you take them appropriately.\n    * Rid your home of knives, guns, razors or other weapons you may consider using for self-destructive purposes.\n    * Schedule daily activities for yourself that have brought you even small pleasure in the past, such as taking a walk, listening to music, watching a funny movie, knitting or visiting a museum.

"why does the mayan calendar stop on dec 21 2012?

The end of the 13th b'ak'tun is conjectured to have been of great significance to the Maya, but does not necessarily mark the end of the world according to their beliefs, but a new beginning or time of re-birth. According to the Popol Vuh, a book compiling details of creation accounts known to the Quiché Maya of the colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the first three creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where men were placed. The Maya believed that the fourth world would end in catastrophe and the fifth and final world would be created that would signal the end of mankind.\n\nThe last creation ended on a long count of 13.0.0.0.0. Another 13.0.0.0.0 will occur on December 21, 2012, and it has been discussed in many New Age articles and books that this will be the end of this creation or something else entirely. However, the Maya abbreviated their long counts to just the last five vigesimal places. There were an infinite number of larger units that were usually not shown. When the larger units were shown (notably on a monument from Coba), the end of the last creation is expressed as 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, where the units are obviously supposed to be 13s in all larger places. In this age we are only approaching 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.13.0.0.0.0, and the larger places are nowhere near the 13s that would match the end of the last creation. (Schele and Friedel 1990: 430)\n\nThis is confirmed by a date from Palenque, which projects forward in time to 1.0.0.0.0.0, which will occur on October 13, 4772 (a Friday). The Classic Period Maya likely did not believe that the end of this age would occur in 2012. According to the Maya, there will be a baktun ending in 2012, a significant event being the end of a 13th 400 year period, but not the end of the world.\n\nclick here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar"

"How do Christians reconcile the errors and contradictions within the Bible?
Cain's wife?\nThe ""others"" that Cain's mark protects him against?\nMoses' Father in Law's changing name from one verse to the next?\n4-legged grasshoppers?\n\nSeriously, if it's the word ofGod, you think'd it be innerrant, eh?\n\nBut, it obviously isn't.\nso, how DO you Christians explain it away?
Being brought up as an anligcan I was always allowed to take a very open interpretation of this text , and I read the whole thing cover to cover before i'd turned 13 I even at that age noticed these stiffling contradictions , There are probably three issues at play here , 1. THE BIBLE IS NOT THE WORD OF GOD , (unlike the Koran or The Book of The Law the bible wasn't dictated to a human from a higher entity) . It is a a bunch of texts grouped together in order to furfther a specific agenda ( That of the Holy Roman Empire).It is as much a work of propaganda as it is a religious text.  Many christian holidays are also of this nature , attributed to the same dates as various pagan festivals in order to over-ride the significance of these days with Christian propaganda , \n\n2. The Bible was written by hundreds of authors over a period of thousands of years , if we look at any other book which has the Bibles status , they have been written by one person over a period of several years, the original texts of the bible also had their base in many different languages , Aramaic , Greek , Ancient Hebrew , and many others.\n\n3.The bible was compiled by humans a Bishop and a council of his followers decided back in the 1300's if my memory serves me correctly , on what books were to be included and excluded , those interested in the true basis of christian belief may want to read the apocrypha or the corpus hermeticum , which are a complilation of Christian writings based on Gnosis and have as much validity as the bible if you've only read the books of the bible you only have been given half the information."

I have to do 42 in two minutes with the only rest being in the up position of the push-up. I can do all 42 in the two minutes except I always have to put my knee down or even just lay down for a moment to continue again. I can do about 25 without breaking but by that time I can barely hold myself up without resting for a bit. So I wanted to know some exercises I could do (along with push-ups, or variations of the push-up) to increase my push-up endurance in 8 weeks, again with my ultimate goal being at least 42 push ups in 2 minutes without resting. Thanks.
If you do them, every single day maybe even twice a day, with one day off, adding lets say five a week on top of the 25 you already have, you should be able to do 42 by January. It's about endurance, don't try and cheat this...the reason they want you to be able to do 42 in 2 minutes is b/c this is something you can't fake. You are either strong enough to do it, or not. \n\nOh, Be sure to breathe too. Holding your breath does nothing good for you. And switch up your form too when you are training. Try finger tips, knuckles, elbows close to the body, even one handed if you can, then when you go back to the regular form, you will have increased strength in all the other supporting muscles. Good Luck."
"How can I find several uplifting devotions aimed at senior citizens?
I looking for a devotion I can read to senior citizens that will give them hope.
John writes with a very Pastoral and comforting style in the Gospel and letters he wrote esp 1 Jn.  In chapters 14-17 in the Gospel he records Jesus teaching and comforting the disciples because he will be going away.\nThe Psalms also have a lot of stuff that is encouraging and comforting.\n\n\nJohn 15:11\n“These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full."
"freemasons?
does any one know who the free masons are and what do you think of them
A fraternal order revived in the early 18th century in England, loosely based on associations or guilds of stone cutters (""operative"" masons). Freemasonry (""speculative"" masons) sought to give philosophical, moral, or spiritual meaning to the lodge, tools, and oaths of the stone cutters. Branches of Freemasonry include the Blue Lodge, York Rite, Scottish Rite, and Shriners. Affiliated organizations include the Order of the Eastern Star (for women), the Order of DeMolay (for boys), and the Order of Rainbow (for girls). Most modern adherents maintain that the organization is not a religion but a club or fraternity promoting high moral values and good works. They believe, therefore, that Freemasonry is compatible with and supplements Christianity and other religions. Critics counter that Freemasonry involves secret blood oaths or curses, and that the writings of respected early leaders (Albert Mackey, Albert Pike, etc.) are replete with occult philosophy and religious doctrine contrary to Christianity. Despite Freemasonry's promotion and funding of a number of worthwhile, philanthropic endeavors (free Shriner children hospitals, nursing homes, etc.), many Christian individuals and churches have condemned Freemasonry or warned of elements that they believe are contrary to Christianity. These churches include the Presbyterian Church of America, Southern Baptist Convention, Episcopal Church, Christian Reformed Church, Church of the Nazarene, and Lutheran Church (Missouri and Wisconsin Synods)."

"Is it true that human urine cures athlete's foot?  I heard that soldiers in WW I or II tried this solution.

Very possible. Traditional remedies for athlete's foot include the claim that urine is very effective at killing athlete's foot. Urea, the ""active ingredient"" in urine, is already used in many drugs and treatments made by pharmaceutical companies to treat athlete's foot. This controversial treatment method recommends urinating on the infected area once a day in the shower. According to supporters, urine therapy not only kills existing fungi, it prevents new fungi from growing in the infected area.\nGo figure."
"does a high cea test mean you have cancer?

A CEA test is ordered when the patient’s symptoms suggest the possibility of cancer. The CEA level is also tested before treatment in cancer patients, especially patients with GI cancers. CEA levels are monitored during therapy. It is also used to follow up patients after therapy.\nCEA is most useful to monitor treatment of cancer patients. It is used with patients who have had surgery to measure response to therapy and to monitor whether the disease is recurring. A blood test for CEA is often used as a tumor marker. Physicians can use CEA results to determine the stage and extent of disease, and the outlook in patients with cancer, especially gastrointestinal (GI) and, in particular, colorectal cancer. CEA is also used as a marker for other forms of cancer. It has been found helpful in monitoring patients with cancer of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovary. Not all cancers produce CEA, therefore the CEA test is not used for screening the general population.\n\nOn initial testing, patients with smaller and early-stage tumors are likely to have low, if not normal, CEA levels, while patients with more advanced tumors, or tumors that have spread throughout the body, are likely to have initially high CEA levels. When CEA levels decrease to “normal” levels after therapy, it means that the CEA-producing tumor has been removed. A steadily rising CEA level is occasionally the first sign of tumor recurrence. When cancer spreads to other organs, CEA levels rise and may be present in other types of bodily fluids besides blood. For example, if CEA is detected in cerebrospinal fluid, this indicates a central nervous system metastasis."
"PLEASE, I am not asking for a perpetual motion machine?
I want to know since magnets move metal stuff to them or away from them, can I use that to turn a metal wheel?\n\nOriginal Q at this link:\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArV8dbbI2fwJNzpaw1nPIxvsy6IX?qid=20060620114852AAAJtVq\n\nIf it really can't be done tell me why... (in english please)
If you have one point on the wheel negatively charged, and move a positively charged magnet around it, it would move. \nOr, if you want something less manual, you can motorize one wheel w/ alternationg positive and negative charges around the edges, and then have another identical wheel on an axle right next to it, so as the first wheel turned, the second one would have to turn so that the opposite charges would line up.\nI'm not sure if the second one would work, but i tried. Good luck! =D"
"Why is it important to ensure that a patient is well hydrated and that his electrolyte levels are normal?

Your electrolytes are critical for nearly all body functions - metabolism, nerve conduction, etc.  If the electrolytes are abnormal, you can see decreased function in different systems.  Also, in order to maintain an appropriate electrolyte balance, you need to remain adequately hydrated.  That's why sports drinks like Gatorade are often best for you if you're sweating a lot (losing a lot of electrolytes), although they may not be best if you are losing fluids through vomiting or diarrhea.  In those cases you may be losing significant quantities of water, but not necessarily electrolytes.  \n\nIn the medical setting, we can administer 0.9% NaCl solution to replace lost fluids and sodium, but in a case of dehydration and electrolyte loss, we will opt for a solution call ""Lactated Ringers"" which in simple terms is Gatorade without the colors and flavors that we run directly into your veins."

"how is a co-ordinante bond formed bertween nitrogen and ammonia?
when H+ attacks NH3, i believe H+ attacks one of the electrons of the lone pair of N and takes it away .does the +ve charge come on N or H
The NH3 molecule has an unshared pair of electrons and the H+ ion has lost the one electron in its outermost shell. This enables NH3 to readily donate its unshared pair of electrons and H+ to readily accept that pair. That way, they form a dative covalent bond, in which both H+ and NH3 act simultaneously on each other.  The NH4+ ion is formed, in which the charge is distributed over the whole structure.  It is not localised on any atom. The overall charge is +1 originating from the H+ ion."

"looking 4 site on funny sayings/fact about turning 30 years old?

This is for all you girls 30 years and over.... and for those who are turning 30, and for those who are scared of moving into their 30's...AND for guys who are scared of girls over 30!\n\nThis was written by Andy Rooney from CBS 60 Minutes. (NOTE: This was e-mailed to me so I'm not sure if Andy Rooney wrote it or not - but it's still true regardless.)\n\nAndy Rooney says:\n\nAs I grow in age, I value women who are over 30 most of all. Here are just a few reasons why:\n\nA woman over 30 will never wake you in the middle of the night to ask, ""What are you thinking?"" She doesn't care what you think.\n\nIf a woman over 30 doesn't want to watch the game, she doesn't sit around whining about it! . She does something she wants to do. And, it's usually something more interesting.\n\nA woman over 30 knows herself well enough to be assured in who she is, what she is, what she wants and from whom. Few women past the age of 30 give a damn what you might think about her or what she's doing.\n\nWomen over 30 are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant. Of course, if you deserve it, they won't hesitate to shoot you, if they think they can get away with it.\n\nOlder women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what it's like to be unappreciated.\n\nA woman over 30 has the self-assurance to introduce you to her women friends. A younger woman with a man will often ignore even her best friend because she doesn't trust the guy with other women. Women over 30 couldn't care less if you're attracted to her friends because she knows her friends won't betray her.\n\nWomen get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to a woman over 30. They always know.\n\nA woman over 30 looks good wearing bright red lipstick. This is not true of younger women.\n\nOnce you get past a wrinkle or two, a woman over 30 is far sexier than her younger counterpart.\n\nOlder women are forthright and honest. They'll tell you right off if you are a jerk if you are acting like one! You don't ever have to wonder where you stand with her.\n\nYes, we praise women over 30 for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it's not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed hot woman of 30+, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some 22-year-old waitress."

50th Anniversary's are hard to buy for, because usually the couple has more than their share of knick knacks, they have a fully furnished home, so they need little.  \n\nGive them a gift certificate for a favorite restaurant, or just give them money.  If they are having a party, usually a money tree is available for placing money gift on.  \n\nIf you still would like for them to have a remembrance of you and your gift, why not try a christmas ornament that is engraved with their special wedding day.   Every year they look at it they will remember that special 50th day and the one who gave it."
"Is evolutionary fitness equivalent to energy eficiency?

Evolutionary fitness is a measure of reproductive success no matter how efficient (or whatever) you are. The more healthy, offspring you produce, the more of your genes are passed on to the next generation, and the more evolutionarily fit you are. Of course these offspring have to reproduce as well to validate your fitness. Individuals that do not reproduce have a fitness of zero no matter how efficient (or whatever) they are."

"Which one of the following quantities is not necessarily conserved in nuclear reactions?
-Electric Charge\n-Number of protons\n-Linear momentum\n-Angular momentum\n-Number of protons and neutrons
Electric charge, linear momentum and angular momentum are all absolutely conserved - meaning all of the time.  The problem is that neither number of protons nor the number of protons and neutrons must necessarily be conserved in a reaction.  However, the number of baryons (essentially the number of ""large"" particles, in this case protons and neutrons) is not conserved only in certain specific reactions.  My guess is that your teacher either doesn't know that or is simplifying things for you.  Consequently, I'd go with ""number of protons""."

"how long does marijuana stay in your system and whats the most effective way to cleanse yourself of its traces

Marijuana can stay in your system up to 3 months, but at that time it's only detectable in hair follicles or in your blood. With urine, it usually stays in your system about 2 weeks to a month. The best way to cleanse yourself is to take a detox pill or drink. Most of the drinks that you get in a head shop only cleanse your system for a short period of time, like 4 hours, which gives you a small window of time if you're taking a drug test or something. if you are looking for a more lasting option, there is a detox pill you can take twice a day for 10 days, and your system will be completely clean permanently (unless, of course, you smoke again). I would suggest the ProTox Pro Clenzer, the advanced 10 day. It is a body detoxification formula (A*k*a ""dietary supplement"") that you can find in most head shops. Niacin is the primary ingredient in these types of detoxifiers, it is a natural cleanser. Also other things rich in niacin can help, too, such as green tea and cranberry juice. Good luck, hope this helped."

Is it perhaps because the Bible is not a very clear book. Has it been manipulated for political reasons? Is there really any human value in it? After all it says though shalt not kill. This doesn't seem to have made any difference to the way Christians behave.

Let x = World Oil shares, and y = Zinco shares.\n\nSo we have the following 2 equations:\n\nx + y = 450\n7.50x + 3.25y = 2100\n\nMultiply the first equation by 7.5 then subtract the second equation from the first to solve for y:\n\n7.50x + 7.50y = 3375\n7.50x + 3.25y = 2100\n------------------------------\n0x + 4.25y = 1275\n\ny = 1275 ÷ 4.25 = 300\n\nNow substitute y=300 into your first equation to solve for x:\n\nx + y = 450\nx + 300 = 450\nx = 450-300 = 150\n\nSo, World Oil = x = 150 shares\nZinco = y = 300 shares\n\nHope that helped!\n\n~ ♥ ~"
"Are there any Scientologists? And if so, what exactly do you ""believe"" in (i.e. God, man is God, etc.)

Yep, there are currently over 8 million Scientologists in more that 150 countries world wide. However we are a new religion, only 55 years old so you will have to give us a bit more time as we just got started.\nThe true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:\n1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.\n2. People find it interesting.\n3. People find it works.\n4. People pass it along to others.\n5. It grows.\nAs to your question about our ""beliefs"",  this is a hard one to answer\nbecause nothing in Scientology is true for you unless it is true for YOU. And even then, it is only true for you, according to YOUR observation and experience . This is a very important point of personal integrity in Scientology.\nSo it really isn't any kind of belief system. This is quiet different from most other religions. One usually tries to understand something by comparing it to other similar things, so with Scientology, as a religion\nit is hard to understand it in this way, because it does not have this particular similarity with other religions.\n\nFollowing is a pretty good description of what it is. I hope this helps you to understand it better:\n\nScientology is an applied religious philosophy. When I say ""applied"" I mean you actually use it in your life to change or improve existing conditions. This is different from a religious practice. All religions if you learn about them have a basic philosphy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances, and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this, but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It does not intrude on anyones faiths of beliefs particularly in the area of God , the Supreme Being, or the Infinite. This area is left totally up to the indivdual, which is why you can be a practicing Jew or Atheist,for example and still use and apply the priniciples of Scientology in your life. It does not conflict. If anything it will enhance your understanding of your chosen religious practice.\nAnd it is only true for you according to your own observation and experience with it.\nIt is a non denominational religion . The dictionary definition that applies:\nReligion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.\n\nThe most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a ""thing"" you HAVE but what YOU actually are.\nThe whole purpose of Scientology is to increase an individual's understanding and awareness of himself. And thereby his native abilities .\nWhen you do this the sphere and zone of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life, his family ,his friends, his groups and mankind which he is part of.\n\nHow this result is achieved is the ""technology"" of Scientology, which was developed by L.Ron Hubbard after his extensive research and the discoveries he made, about the human spirit.\nHe completed his research before his death in 1986 and left all of his results and copyrights\nto the Church of Scientology along with most of his considerable estate., when he died.\n\nHe published a book in 1951 to communicate the basic principles he discovered called: "" Scientology The Fundementals of Thought"""

If there is a burning muscular pain in the back of the head or the top, it may be vision. Do you have problems seeing things up close/far away/reading etc.? Ofcourse, I'm no MD by any means, and I'm sure that you need a proper medical diagnoses."
"What is Multiplier?

Maybe you need to be a little bit more specific. But the idea of multiplier in economics and finance is easy. Imagine you deposit $100 in the bank. The bank takes that money, and imagining a 10% reserve for the bank, he lends it, so the bank lends $90. That creates ""more money"". You got your $100, and someone else got $90. On its simplest form, this multiplier, which is the the monetary policy multiplier, is given by the formula = 1/(coeficient of legal bank reserves). \n\nAyways, there are many kinds of multipliers: consumption, savings, investment, expenditure, among others. All have the same principal."
"Does cereal actually make you fat??.. There is not much fat content in ""Capt. Crunch"" and "" Pops""

It's not the fat per se in breakfast cereal that's the culprit - it's the tons of refined sugar.\n\nThe sugar represents an enormous caloric intake, which in our typical sedentary lifestyles isn't metabolized by physical activity - and is then stored as fat.\n\nThis is also true of typical soft drinks, as well as white bread, pasta, white rice - any kind of simple carb that is quickly converted by the body to sugar, and if not metabolized by activity, then gets stored by the body as inventory - fat tissue.\n\nBest to you."
"Do you see a strange star in the sky right now? What is it?

It depends on where you live. But most reported ""star"" is Venus, a very bright yellow/white blob on the sky setting or rising a few hours after or before the Sun. It has two old names ""Evening star"" and ""Morning star"" refering to it setting just after the Sun sets, or rising just before the Sun rises."

"What are all of the side effects of hashimoto's disease?
I'm told that it can cause kidney failure, lupus, RA and more. I'm told that it can cause sponutaneous abortions (miscarriages) etc...I have looked on the internet but it's not really saying much about the harsh effects of it. Are there certain foods that make it worse, can you exercise to help relieve the muscle/joint pains...what can you do for that?
I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease.  I am a 25 year old male, and usually this occurs in middle aged women, so I don't know how I got it except that it runs in my family.  Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disease that occurs in the thyroid gland.  Over time, it destroys good thyroid cells so that your thyroid becomes underactive, so everything that comes along with an underactive thyroid you could start to experience.  I have not heard of the long term ramifications, however, I know that you should get treated and take thyroid medicine once you become underactive.  I make visits to see the Endocrinologist once every 6 months or year to monitor my thyroid."

is watching cartoons at this age a sign of being immature? I think they are funny and entertaining even more than some movies.
I am a 63 year old male, and I like Spongebob Squarepants and Jimmy Neutron when my grandchildren come over.  I still like The Road Runner And The Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn and the other older cartoons.  I just think they are funny and show a lot of imagination.

"What do you think of this miracle of healing of diabetes ?
We were having a prayer meeting and group worship time. A business man came in who had suffered from diabetes for a long time. He said he had lost feeling totally in his feet. We were all praying for each other and my friend got down on the floor and laid both his hands on his feet and began praying. He prayed for quite a while. A few weeks later the man returned and told us the Lord had healed him and the feeling in his feet had returned.  Blessed be the Lord Jesus....sweet Jesus....
Praise be to God and God alone\nThe Gift of Healing still carries on today"
"51 yr female, overweight but active, muscle spasms, achy joints (not symetrical), uncontrolled shaking.Whatsup
Lost 40 lbs at beginning of yr with exercise/diet. Enjoying going to gym but stopped couple of months ago because have been feeling very tired, achy.  Wake up each am with somethingelse hurting. sometimes last through day, sometimes 2-3 days.  Pain has started during day as well and travels (ie: starts in shoulder, moves down to hand by next day). Have tried Aleve, hyrocodone, ultram, ibuprofen. Nothing works.   Taking glucosimin for joint health.  Stress seems to make it worse. Work as psych nurse - not a physically demanding job. Have thought of fibromyalgia, rheum. arthritis.  Anyone have any ideas of what this might be or what I could ask dr. for - ie pain meds.
I have fibromyalgia, and many of your symptoms sound familiar . The uncontrolled shaking, though, sounds like something more is going on. \n\nI do experience uncontrolled shivering sometimes, especially after extreme stress - like going into shock. That's definitely not a daily thing, though. My hands shake just about all the time, but I wouldn't call that ""uncontrolled shaking.""\n\nHow long have you experienced these symptoms? Have you been to your general practitioner? Please, make an appointment to see a doctor as soon as possible if you haven't already done so.\n\nFibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion, of course, so it wouldn't be made 'til everything else was ruled out. Rheumatoid arthritis will show up on tests.\n\nGood luck!"
"Is Thanksgiving like Christmas without the religious stuff?  They are both a time for families to get together

Well, religious people are always religious regardless of the occasion...\n\nBut yeah actually it was meant to be a sort of patriotic celebration of the survival of the (religious, granted) pilgrims through the first harsh year after coming to America. That's why it's only celebrated in the US. There isn't any global religious significance.\n\nThe dinner goes much like Christmas around here, big dinner that's usually turkey, and the family sitting around the table (hopefully) enjoying each other's company. There aren't any gifts exchanged usually, except maybe something for the hostess like wine or flowers. There aren't really any Thanksgiving lights or songs to speak of.\n\nWhen I lived in Europe I missed my family more at Thanksgiving than I did at Christmas, oddly enough. I guess maybe because there were some Christmas celebrations going on that were very fun.\n\nIt might be seen as a sort of warm-up for the Christmas holiday (or Yule for me... same difference)."

"What bugs you most about the questions *some* people ask?

Dear thiscrossbear_lee,\n\nAn excellent question. But my, where to start? I guess this is my personal top three:\n\n1. Provocative and inflammatory tirades only thinly disguised as questions: ""why can't Democrats/Republicans admit that they are all fascist baby-killers who eat their own excrement?""\n\n2. Rhetorical questions whose only purpose is to preach, vent, and gain approval for an ill-considered and primitive opinion: ""does anyone else feel that immigrants are stinky scuzzballs who should all be kicked out of the country?""\n\n3. Questions with no hint of syntax, grammar or spelling in them which look to have been written by a drunk telegraphist afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome: ""i tihnk mots moslums;; r fuck sutpid asshoels. who wantadisrtoy!  tihs cuntry, wat du u fucking al beli:ve.""\n\nThe worst questions contain elements of all the points above.

"How do I start a business cleaning offices?

My advice is for you to read more of the business, so you can determine what you think you want and can given your present resources. The book ""101 Best Businesses to Start"" estimates that first year potential earnings for this business can be $40,000, while startup expenses can be $5,000 or even lower. Industry experts, however, recommend raising $50,000 for a startup capital in order to be able to invest in heavy duty cleaning equipment and have more resources to spend in marketing the business.\n\nYou can start by reading the article ""Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business"" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm . The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips to help market your business:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\nFor more in-depth information about the business, we have compiled a list of books on the topic and you can either purchase the book or borrow them from your library. The list of recommended books on starting a cleaning business can be found at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/bookstore/homecleaning.htm\n\n- Commercial and Residential Cleaning Services: A Resource Guide to Developing and Maintaining Your Own Janitorial or Home Cleaning Business (Author: Walter Fenix)\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business"
"Is it better not to tell people about God and Jesus?
Some Christians say that if someone hasn't heard about Jesus like maybe a tribe living in amazon rain forest, or the Gobi dessert, or the deepest parts of Africa etc then God will understand why they haven't accepted Jesus as they're savior and they won't get thrown in ot the lake of fire for not believing. So isn't telling people who never heard of Jesus and about Christianity not a good thing? Coz as soon as u tell them, they then have heard God and Jesus and will go to Hell if they don't accept jesus as they're savior. But if u hadn't told them then God would have understood why they hadn't accepted jesus as they're savior and they wouldn't go to Hell for not accepting him. So isn't just better not to tell people and spare them the worry?
It is better to keep your religion to yourself.  If you are a believer, great.  Celebrate and practice your faith all you want.  There are lots of people that do not want to hear your ""truth"".  The world would be a much better place if people learned to keep their religions to themselves."

"what is the celeberation going on in south india now?

Celebration\nPongal is also known as Tamizhar Thirunal or The Festival of Tamils among the Tamil people. The Tamil language saying Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum (தை பிறந்தால் வழி பிறக்கும்) -- literally meaning, the birth of the month of Thai will pave way for new opportunities -- is often quoted with reference to the Pongal festival.\n\nUsually the festival falls in the middle of the month of January in the Western calendar. The festival is celebrated for four days from the last day of the Tamil month Maargazhi (Dec/Jan) to the third day of Thai (Jan/Feb). The first day, Bhogi, is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials by setting fire on them to mark the end of old and emeregence of new.\n\nThe second day, Pongal, is the main day which falls on the first day of the Tamil month Thai (January 14 or January 15 in western calender). The Pongal day is celebrated by boiling rice with fresh milk and Jaggery early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel — a tradition that is the literal translation for Pongal (in Tamil). The moment the rice gets boiled over and bubbles out of the vessel, it is offered to the Sun God, a gesture which symbolises thanksgiving to the Sun for providing prosperity. People also prepare savories and sweets, visit each other's homes, and exchange greetings.\n\nThe third day, Mattu Pongal, is meant to offer thanks to the cattle, as they provide with milk and are used to plough the lands. Jallikattu, a violent taming the wild bull contest, marks the main event of this day. On the last day, Kanum Pongal — the word ""kanum"" literally meaning 'to view' — youngsters used to gather at river banks to view and select their future life partners (which has fallen out of practice currently). People, especially store-keepers visit beaches and theme parks during this day in modern times. During the pongal season, people eat sugar canes and decorate the houses with kolam."

"What is the origin of the seven deadly sins?
I've read that the Bible gives a vague outline of seven things God does not like but is that really the origin of it all?  I've also read that it was Dante's Divine Comedy that first clearly outlined them and then a pope in the 1600s that confirmed the validity of them.  So what's the truth?
Here are the seven holy virtues as opposites to the seven deadly sins. According to Dante's The Divine Comedy the sins have an order of greatness, and the virtues a respective order of greatness as well. This order is shown below from the lowest to the highest.\n\n+ Holy Virtues +\nChastity (purity) \nModeration (self-restraint) \nGenerosity (vigilance) \nZeal (enthusiasm) \nMeekness (composure) \nCharity (giving) \nHumility (humbleness) \n\n+ Deadly Sins +\nLust (inappropriate desire) \nGluttony (over-indulgence)  \nGreed (avarice) \nSloth (laziness)  \nWrath (anger)  \nEnvy (jealousy)  \nPride (vanity)  \n\nThe history of this list goes back at least to Pope St. Gregory the Great and St. John Cassian, but while the list itself is not strictly biblical, the Bible proscribes all seven. \n\nWith love in Christ."

You are probably self medicating. Maybe you are trying to cope with some kind of internal problem. I know how it feels to not want to go to a professional and get probed with all these ideas that don't help. Try spending time with family away from the bottle. Try to focus on all the good stuff that you do when you are sober and not doing drugs. My father is a drug user and my brother was an alcoholic. I gave my brother support, told him how I felt about his drinking. I told him that I needed him to stop because it hurt me to see him sick in bed, vomiting. I hated having to nurse him. I thought my brother was going to die and I told him that he scared me when he drank and would come home almost passing out and me having to keep him up. I almost lost my brother a few times. He was depressed but I told him how much I loved him. Maybe you need someone to really tell you how it makes them feel to see you drinking or doing drugs. I told my dad that I hated him doing drugs, so he hid the drugs. He is still doing drugs and I told him I wouldn't talk to him or see him until he became clean. Professional help doesn't always do the trick. You need family and a support system. This is the only true way to kick the habbit and feel better. Try little steps. I know not from my own experience but from the experience of my loved ones. They tried professional help and got nowhere. You got to be willing to change before you can change."
"what helps tonail fungus, besides going to dr. i have migrains and don't want to take lamisil?

Many of the ""cures"" that you find on the net contain Tea Tree oil. After looking at some of the sites, I realized that I have one toe nail that doesn't look or feel quite right so I am going to the healthfood store today to get some tea tree oil. I have used it before for other things like my husbands dermatitis and for tooth picks for bad breath. This oil kills bacteria and fungus as well as some virus's. I will look around at the store and see if there is any better over the counter suggestion (besides what you can get at Wally World and Walgrees). It might be possible to take a pill or three, I will ask my herbal specialist and get back to you!"

"If you attended a youth group, or you still do, how did it affect you?
I am a youth pastor and I am just wondering about your experience with your youth group/pastor.\n\nI love my job, I love the students, just wondering about your experiences with your past or present youth group. What worked, what didn't. Maybe even an awesome event!
I had a great time as a teen going to youth group activities both at my own church and my friends' churches. I never felt like I had to do anything immoral or illegal to have a good time. I learned a lot about the Bible and my relationship with God was nurtured and strenghthened. Pairing off was never a big concern for me because I was a late bloomer and guys weren't that interested in me. \n\nThere were so many things I got to do. Hay rides with hot chocolate made by church ladies waiting when we got back. Silly camp songs. Canoing. Playing hide and seek at night. Lock-ins. Movies. I don't know. Maybe I'm just easy to please and have fun doing most anything. \n\nThe youth pastors that made a big impact on my life were kind, genuine, honest people. They lived what they taught and took their faith seriously, but knew how to have fun. Keep up the good work. It really does make a difference."
"Flashing Light?
From about 5 yrs, it  was late at night and i was talking to a friend on the phone when i notice a light flashing so quickly infront of my room. So, i think it was the electricity. I turn off the main switch and i come back to my room. The flashing light passes again! i saw it for about 4 times flashing and passing infront of my door room. Frankly, I was in panic and started crying. Anyone has any idea about what this might be?\n\nThank U so Much!
Most likely it was a reflection of passing car lights.  The light could have reflected off something outside and into your room.  If there was anyone else in the house it could have been a practical joke."

"Unsystematic risk refers to investment risk that is?

Joe got it right in his second paragraph.  You can think of risk versus # of assets (assuming they're different from a risk-reward standpoint, exhibit uncorrelated returns, etc) and that as you diversify, you're travelling along an asymptotic curve that approaches systematic risk that cannot be diversified away regardless of the # of assets.\n\nUnsystematic risk refers to risk that can be diversified away."

"With all the techology we have today why can't we predict weather more  acturately?? There has to be a better

Alot of the things people consider ""technology"" these days are little gadgets such as cell phones and palm pilots and flat screen displays and what have you which make little contribution to the actual forecasting process. I.e., you can get a tiny radar image on your cell phone but it is nothing more than a weather service met could see on an AFOS screen more than a decade ago - only alot smaller so you can't see a whole lot of detail. These days you can get an automated forecast for your location on your cell phone which some computer algorithm spits out, but it is no match for someone analyzing the data. In many ways speed and quantity is sacrificed for accuracy and quality.\n\nSome technological advances are very helpful such as doppler radars replacing conventional radars, but many improvements come from using the existing technology more effectively to improve observation and modeling - theoretical advancements which make it possible to use satellites to sound the atmopshere, better understanding of physical processes from reasearch to make models more accurate, understanding small scale processes better so we can be better at saying whether a certain weather feature will occur in one county and not the next, etc."

"Why doesn't a neon sign eventually ""run out"" of excited atoms and produce dimmer and dimmer light?

Unlike an incandescent bulb which has a filament that can burn out, neon lights have no filament, and have a typical life span of 7 to 10 years, and some have been known to last for 20 years! Neon lights operate on relatively high voltage, but very low amperage (high pressure, but very low volume). Imagine a garden hose with only a trickle of water. Put your thumb over the end, and it comes out with more force, but you use much less water. Just like water pressure, a transformer is needed to increase the electrical pressure to the required current to make the gas inside the tube ""glow"". Even though neon operates at a higher voltage, the transformer does all the work, thus keeping your electrical load low."
"what are some non-aethetics uses of curve stitching besides bridges? Why is curve stitching used in this way?
for example, some suspension bridges make use of the curve stitching design. However. why is curve stitching used? What is the point of using it? In what way is it different?\nWhat other uses are there that are not to beautify things like artwork?
In applied math, curve stitching (via spline interpolation, for example) is often used to approximate an original curve that is hard to calculate with with a manufactured curve that is easy to calculate. This makes it easier to see what the mathematical traits of the original curve might be without having to calculate the entire original curve."

No. Because they both are a manifestation of the same thing. Can't have one without the other.
Yes. Theoretically, if you try to determine the 'place' of a photon 'exactly' as if it is a particle, you will not be able to detect it's velocity. And when you want to know its 'exact' speed, you will have no idea about where it is, just like a wave."

"i remve my armpit hair by shaving but  it resulted 2 chicken skin wat can i do bring bak my smuth skin?
I shave for almost 3 years now.Im 14 and i'm worried.i cant wear sleeve less anymore.
You r just 14 and i wonder whats the hurry all about. u started shaving at 11? Your hair roots must be highly provoked and u are definitely gonna get thick hair growth and black damaged skin now. \n\nAnd if u wanna stick to shaving, then follow this.\n\n1) First thing in the morning is not the best time to shave. Your skin will be puffy, making it difficult to get to the bottom of the hair shaft you seek to remove.\n2) Don’t ever shave dry hair. Take your shower or bath before you shave, giving the hair time to become engorged with water and thus an easier target to shave.\n3) For a close shave, scrub your skin with an abrasive sponge to remove dead skin around the hair shaft.\n4) Try using hair conditioner instead of shaving cream; it’ll leave your skin very soft.\n5) Change the razor blade after every third shave to reduce friction. You don’t want to irritate your skin more than necessary.\n6) Shave your underarms after you’ve done your body hair. This will allow more time for your underarm hair to become prepared for a close shave. Move the razor in the same \ndirection as the hair growth.\n8) Use as little pressure as possible on your razor. Use a razor with a hefty handle instead of pressing hard.\n9) Always apply a moisturizer after shaving to prevent flaky skin.\n\nIf all this does not work, go to a doctor , i mean a dermetologist immediately"

"Is there any symptoms if you have prostate cancer.?

It would depend on if the prostate itself is swollen and choking off the urethra (which is one of the same symptoms of benign prostate hypertrophy AKA BPH). Frequent urination or the sensation of needing to go but can't is quite common. In both cases, the person needs to see a urologist. He most likely will conduct a PSA test, the normal range for that test is 0-4. A digital exam will also help determine if there is any hardening of the prostate indicating a tumor. There is much more involved, however, if you are 50 or over, you should get a PSA test done once a year. My husband was fine last year then this year he had stage 3 prostate cancer that was discovered with the yearly test.\n\nI wish you the best!"

Your score will dip no matter what you do. For how long depends on how you deal with cleaning up you credit.\n\nIf you pay the accounts without using a pay for delete agreement, they will just notate your reports as paid collections. Which will be just as bad as having the collection on your reports.\n\nIf you use a pay for delete agreement, when they delete the account your score will dip from losing the history of the account. But you scores will probably rebound sooner than having a paid collection. \n\nIf you are dealing with collection agency's, you should send a debt validation first. When they properly validate the debt (and you are still in SOL) send them a pay for delete letter. \n\nInclude in that letter that they will not only delete the tradeline they have placed on your reports, but they will also not sell the debt, sell the remainder of the debt (if you request to only pay a percentage of it - which you should request) and will not continue to collect the debt. (collection agency's have been known to do all of those - even when the debt is paid.) \n\nIf the debt is out of the statute of limitations (SOL) for your state, you have the right to ""not pay"" it. After you send the debt validation letter and you know it is out of SOL, you have the right to send them a SOL letter. And, if they are reporting incorrectly on your reports (which they probably are) you have the right to dispute the account with the credit bureaus. Requesting that the accounts are either corrected, or if not, deleted.\n\nI would also suggest trying to get a secured card or two. If you do that now, you would have a years history on it/them which will help you when you want to get that loan.  \n\nOnly use the cards occasionally for small amounts, a tank of gas etc. and pay in full when you get the statement. Then, keep the cards in your sock drawer for about 6 months before you use them for another small amount.\n\nYou might check out Orchard Bank, HSBC or Bank of America for secured cards.\n\nYou might also want to check out the link I have provided.

"What are the genotype and allele frequencies of both new populations in the next generation?
Suppose that 35% of a population of 100 individuals has hitchhiker's thumb, which is inherited as a recessive.  Supppose also, that 10 individuals, 5 of whom have hitchhiker's thumb, decide to go deep-sea fishing and are stranded on a deserted island for at least a generation, and that all stranded individuals mate.  \n\nWhat are the genotype and allele frequencies of both new populations in the next generation?\n\nThis is an example of what kind of evolutionary force?
H = straight thumb\nh = hitchhiker's thumb\n\nThe main population started with an genotype frequency of hh=0.35 (35% of population showed recessive trait).  Therefore, the allele frequencies are h=0.59 (square root of 0.35) and H=0.41 (the total of all alleles in a population is 1 or 100%).\n\nAfter the people leave to go fishing, hh=0.33 (30 out of 90 people will express the recessive genotype) in the original population.  Therefore h=0.58 and H=0.42\n\nIn the island population, 50% express the recessive genotype, so hh=0.50 making h=0.71 and H=0.29\n\nPart of the original population ""migrated"" to a different location, causing the allele frequency of the original population to change (evolve).  I predict the evolutionary force is geographic isolation."
"What natural frequency would a box vibrate at if its dimensions were 60x60x100cm?
If I wanted to use an enclosed wooden box 60cm x 60cm x 100cm like a speaker box, how would I work out the main natural vibrating frequency, or frequencies of that box from the size dimensions? \nIt’s only 1cm thick plywood.
See the ref. cited below. There are several resonant frequencies. Some are due to vibration of the box panels, and there is not enough information in your question to determine that. For application as a speaker box, you want to avoid those resonances anyway, which means using wood thicker than 1 cm (2 cm or more would be preferable) and/or adding damping material. The other resonances are due to the vibration of the air in the box. If the box is vented or ported, the dominant vibration mode is a cavity resonance which you can calculate from the ""cavity resonant frequency"" link in the ref. Other resonances are similar to room resonance, the natural frequency of wall to opposite wall bounce. This frequency is equal to twice the distance between walls divided by the speed of sound. However, wall bounce is undesirable as it produces a single strong peak response at resonance, whereas a ported box or ""bass reflex"" setup will reduce and spread out the speaker's resonant frequency, providing a smoother and deeper bass response.\nEDIT (responding to your followup questions):\nIf I interpret you correctly, you are talking about nothing but a box, no port, no speaker. In that case you don't have the strong resonance of a ported cavity but just the weaker resonances of material plate stiffness/mass/damping and the closed-cavity (wall bounce) modes. I expect if you hit the box you are exciting the plate modes most strongly. ln other words you have sort of a percussion instrument, but with a lot of damping and without a membrane which would give it a more definite pitch as in a drum. On the other hand if you put inside the box a mike and a source of bounce mode excitation like a speaker, the mike would probably pick up the bounce modes when you tuned the speaker to drive them. Both the speaker and the mike would have to be suitably located (away from the null points of the modes) for maximum response. The second reference below discusses closed-cavity (""room"") resonance in detail."

Afrikaans is related to Dutch, and while they are different, it is possible to understand one or the other without a translation, especially if you understand that the person is speaking Afrikaans and not a poor Dutch (or vice versa)  If you thought the person was trying to speak Dutch, you'd be able to basically understand, but you'd probably think their dutch was a little off."

Razor,Nair, Any tip?  im a man and i want that zone clean! like a porn star!
Do NOT use Nair or any similar product! It is way too harsh for that area. \n\nI suggest shaving after having a hot shower or bath. Make sure you shave with a new razor, lots of foam and in the direction the hair grows. \n\nIf you want a more long lasting effect, go to a salon that does exotic waxing."

"what are two examples of incomplete dominance & give the genotypes & phenotypes?

I assume you asked about autosomal incomplete dominant.  Generally speaking, let's say R is dominant allele for red color and r is the recessive allele for white color.  Incomplete dominant means that when parents RR and rr have offspring Rr, their color will be pink instead of red or white.  It's different from co-dominant which you can use the ABO blood type as an example with people who have AB blood type as an example of codominant."
"Is starting a business considered greedy?
I have a chance to start a business that could help many people in different ways.

"i challenge you to answer this question!! CHALLENGE YOU!?
The sum of 28 consecutive odd, positive integers is a perfect cube. If p and q are the least and greatest of these intergers, the average of the least possible value of p and the least possible value of q is between\n\n(A)80 and 90\n(B)90 and 100\n(C)100 and 110\n(D)110 and 120\n(E)120 and 130\n\ni bet you cant solve it HA\nshow your work if you do =D
Lets call the numbers 2a-27, 2a-25, 2a-23, ..., 2a+23, 2a+25, 2a+27. Thats 28 numbers, and since all the constant terms cancel out, their sum is 28*2a = 56a = 7a*2^3.\nSince we already have a factor of 2^3 in there, all we need for the entire thing to be a cube is a = 7*7*cube.\nThe smallest value of a gives the smallest p and the smallest q, so a = 7*7 = 49.\nThat gives p = 71, q = 125, average = 98, ie B."
"Answer me this?
Consider a gas of N identical spin-0 bosons confined by an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The energy levels in this potential are e=nhf, where n is any nonnegative integer and f is the classical oscillation frequency. The degeneracy of level n is (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n\n\n(a) Find a formula for the density of states, g(e), for an atom confined by this potential.\n\n(b) Find a formula for the condensation temperature of this system in terms of the oscillation frequency f.\n\n(c) This potential effectively confines particles inside a volume of roughly the cube of the oscillation amplitude. The oscillation amplitude, in turn, can be estimated by setting the particle's total energy (of order kT) equal to the potential energy of the ""spring"". Making these associations, and neglecting all factors of 2 and pi and so on, show that your answer to part (b) is roughly equivalent to the formula for the condensation temperature of bosons confined inside a box with rigid walls.

Absolutely, there was a time before ""tv"" and ""AC"" that families used set on front porches on summer evenings and conversed with neighbors as they ""walked"" pass.\nToday with cell phones in hand, we don’t even have time or social space to speak to them, even if we were still on our porches.\nAlmost every home has the living room arranged around the tv  so as to discourage conversation and fix attention on the tv. \nTV dinners, tv trays, under counter tv's most of us don't have very much practice at social interaction.\nElectronic games, tv and computers have replaced outside playing for our children.. Most of us don't know any of our neighbors beyond the one next door.\nChanges in almost every area of social interaction has reduced the need to know and care about those we live around..\nEven our jobs are no longer lifetime careers but we change as technology does.\nWe are more mobile. We no longer stay in one community all our lives but make several changes during our adult lives. \nBusing has ended community schools etc   etc   etc.\nSo many changes based on technology that polite social interaction of yester year is gone forever."

First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your Lupus. I am borderline Lupus right now myself, and I do understand what you are going through.\nSecondly, it must be extremely difficult for you to even be considering letting their father take care of them -- I can't imagine how hard that must be for you emotionally.  I think it may be a good idea, at least at first, to have their father take care of your kids.  That doesn't mean you can't visit or better yet -- have them visit you.  \nAnother question is how old are your kids? are they still very young to be taking care of themselves? If they are teens or older, they should have no problem coming to visit you.  Also, how do you know your kids (if they are older) don't want to stay with you to help you out?  Just a few things to consider.  Either way, I hope you get better and I wish you the best.  Good Luck."

"Trying Again?
Why is it, that we cannot sleep standing up? What is the biological advantage? Why was it selected?
my friend, sleep is important for human development and cell regeneration.\nif u find out why and how we sleep u can know why don't we sleep standing up.\nhow we sleep?\nA hormone called serotonin is secreted and guides our brain in 2 stages in sleep; the REM an the non-REM.\nthe non-REM stage is the normal sleep stage and begins as we begin sleeping process. The REM is the ""pic"" is sleeping curve. REM stage is reached after a 6-8 hours of sleep. it's the time where maximum relaxation and comfort. Brain at this stage perform maximum proficiency and especially creativity. as a proof many scientific project are done for this and it is found that dreams may come in this stage, which means that creativity and emotions are homogenized in this stage.\nWhy we sleep? sleep is important mainly for the relaxation of muscles, also for nerve cells. the most important muscle that is active all the time and is relaxed while sleeping is the cardiac muscle. when laying in a horizontal position all Ur body organs are approximately at the same level with Ur heart, so your heart do not need much force to pump blood upward (to brain) nor to cycles the blood through inferior parts (feet, genital organs...)\na good question my friend."

I know that dyes are not good for giving accurate pH measurement as they can be affected by components of a solution but...\n\nI used this dye in a titration of NaOH into HCl (in equimolar concentrations).

"What is it that most religious freaks live in the South, or the country, or are not too bright?
Every Baptist, or Evangelical, or downright Jesus Freak on Television has a southern accent, is unintelligent, and comes from the rural areas? Why is religion more popular with them?
it seems to me that people who live in more populated areas interact with more people and hear and discuss more different ideas than people who live in less crowded areas.  I think seeing that there are people in other religions and from other cultures AND that they are good people leads one to be more open-minded and tolerant --- and less convinced that there is only one right way to believe."
"Is smoking weed bad?

I could ask you if stealing is bad, or if murder is bad.  You would probably say yes.  So the answer becomes logical; since weed is responsible for both, it is bad.\n\nYou would be stealing from the government by having a product that can't be taxed.   People rob and kill because the junk exists for profit on the street.\n\nAnd for the people who say that they smoke it for their own pleasue must be forgetting that Uncle Sam didn't see a penny of the profit, and as an American, that's stealing.  And how would you know that the junk wasn't responsible for someone's death before it got to you?\n\nAlso, if it were legal, do you think that EVERYONE should be allowed to smoke it?  I'm sure you know people that wouldn't be good on it.  So for that reason, you would say that it would be bad for them to smoke it.  \n\nI hope you understand the philosophy."
"What is the origin of the word posh?
Port Out Starboard Home has not been proven.
The origin of the word is obscure. The first recorded use of the word was in the British satirical magazine Punch on 25 September 1918, although an earlier possible reference uses the word push [4]. The OED records a definition of the word as a noun from 1890, meaning ""a dandy"".\n\nA popular but false etymology states the expression originated from the phrase ""Port Out, Starboard Home"", which, before air-conditioning, were allegedly the most desirable cabin locations on ships travelling to and from British colonies in the Far East because they were shaded from the sun in both directions. However, extensive searching of shipping company records and tickets from that period has failed to reveal any evidence for explicit ""Port Out, Starboard Home"" reservations. [1][2][4].\n\nThis false definition is not helped by a song in the musical version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The song P.O.S.H. including the lyrics:\n\n""Whenever I'm bored I travel abroad but ever so properly, \n""Port out, starboard home, posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh."""

"hw problem on momentum and collision: how high will the base of the swing rise above its original level?
The bird perched on the swing has a mass of 52.0 g, and the base of the swing has a mass of 153 g.  Assume that the swing and bird are originally at rest and that the bird then takes off horizontally at 2.00 m/s.  If the base can swing freely (i.e., without friction) around the pivot, how high will the base of the swing rise above its original level?
though instant the bird leaves the swing we assume that the centre of gravity does not change of the system. Therefore 52*2=153*x, where x represents the swing velocity= 0.6797m/s.\n\nnow the energy for the swing is going to be conserved.  Just a great kinetic energy with potential energy and get the height. mgh=1/2mv2\n\nCalculate h.

"why is the rainbow always in the shape of a semi circle? why not straight?

As spijk says, the rainbow is formed by the refraction (bending) of light as it passes trhough rain drops. But the reason an observer sees the rainbow as an ""arc"" is that the sunlight must be refracted at a certain constant critical angle between the arrival of the light ray and the path back to the observers eye for the colors to be seen. This angle occurs over an arc in relation to the observer.  Here's why:\n\n   There are three conditions necessary for the rainbow to be visible:\n\n  First, there has to be water droplets in the air (These   droplets may or may not be falling to the ground as rain), and -\n\nSecond: -  the sun must be behind the observer while looking at the rainbow - and -\n\nThird: - the light rays that become visible as the rainbow must pass through the raindrops at the critical angle.\n\nIf you draw these conditions out in three dimensions, it is apparent that the necessary conditions only prevail to the observer as an arc.  \n\nBy the way, the rainbow is not always a semi-circle! If you're airborne, above the droplets with the sun high in the sky, you will see the rainbow as a circle!\n\nI fly my own plane and have seen this condition on several occasions, and even took a picture of it once!\n\nNow you can understand why seeing rainbows is relatively rare - the conditions for their appearance are not very common, mainly because you have to have water droplets in the air at the same time that the sun is not blocked by clouds!  That's why the most common time to see a rainbow is after a relatively small afternoon thunderstorm cell passes your position (usally passing from west to east), dropping rain beneath it as it passes and then leaving clear sky behind allowing the sun rays to strike the raindrops.\n\nGo to the website below for diagrams on how the rainbow works! A picture is worth a thousand words, especially a picture of a rainbow! :-)\n\neo.ucar.edu/rainbows \n\nBy the way, good question!  You have a keen mind, keep asking questions!  After reading and doing your homework, its the best way to learn!\n\nHope this answer  helps.\n\nCharlieQ"

"vaginal pains before intercourse.....?
Hello, it is quite strange to ask a question like this online,but I don't know what to do anymore. Each time before intercouse, during the foreplay, I get this stinging pain in my vagina. It is hard to discribe, but it feels as if you can feel yourself becomming wet. THe pain goes away when I am not stimulated anymore. I have been having it for the last 6 months and it just seems to be getting worse. I went to the gyn and she said everything looks normal. Has anybody experienced something like that,if yes, does anybody know what it is and what I can do about it? thanks
I started experiencing the same thing that you described about 5 ears ago. I also started having irregular periods and later on was diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic Ovarian disease). You may not have it, and may have something else that contributes to it - but what was creating and adding to the pain was decrease in natural lubrication.\n\nIn my case, PCOS was causing me to stop naturally lubricate and all the foreplay was kind of irritating the delicate tissue - it felt like I was being pinched or that my husband had grown a sharp nail. \n\nOver time I came to dread intercourse. In my mind, intercouse and foreplay = pain. \n\nMy therapist adviced me to firstly, cut caffine from my diet. \n\nSecondly, andnd irrespective of how and when I naturally lubricate, I should always start with KY jelly - the one that warms on contact. Any natural lubrication is a bonus.\n\nThirdly, practice relaxation techniques - play some soft instrumetal music and read the word RELAX in your mind. And as you read it, relax every muslce in your body. Start with your legs, then hands. arms, neck. When you have mastered this technique use it when you are getting ready for foreplay and intercourse.\n\nAnd fourthly, explore yourself. My therapist asked me to start explore masterbation - with my fingers. And in the process pinpoint the exact location or movement/ style that evoked that pinching sensation and then share it with my partner. \n\nAll the four combined with a glass of wine in the initial times of exploration/ fixing the problem helped. So, good luck. I hope I helped a little. My GYN didn't physically find anything wrong with me either. It's quite sometime later that I found that stress was making my periods irregular which was contributing to the fall in natural wetness.\n\nSo, take it slow. This may not be the perfect solution but it is worth a try. I am now a proud mother of a 1 year old and things are so much better."
"Most scientists believe that life on Earth?

Look up the Miller-Urey experiement in wikipedia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Urey_experiment\n\nWhat is rarely mentioned is that the creation of amino acids is fairly insignificant, especially when you consider the necessary steps in protein synthesis. Also, Miller repeatedly changed the components of his ""primitive"" atmosphere to produce the various amino acids. Lastly, the experiment produced large amounts of formaldehyde, which reacts with the amino acids and makes them effectively unusable for protein synthesis. So, I'm not sure that the experiment really proves what it was originally thought to prove.\n\n2)\n* A homozygous dominant has two dominant alleles\n  RR\n\n* The hetrozygous has one dominant and one recessive allele\n  Rr\n\nWhen you cross them you get the following:\n\n      R     R\n------------------\nR | RR     RR\n\nr  |  Rr       Rr\n\nEach of the four resulting crosses have one dominant and one recessive allele.

i got a report from the lab after some discomfort that i showed a past myocardia infarction. i didn't even know what that meant. didn't ask and doc didn't take a moment to explain. assumed i understood. i chanced to look it up on the web and was surprized. asked my family doctor who had failed to read the report as well. i had felt pressure from time to time but never had intense pain they say comes with a heart attack. cardio man and gp said it must have been a silent attack while i was asleep. docs have that thin red line like cops have the thin blue line. i now do not trust any of them. they have sneaky looks and i sometimes suspect they carved me up with a four-way bypass and a subsequent mountain of pills and bills and they were partially or altogether motivated by economics of a heart speciality heart hospital. i met one caring old nurse in icu.. also got a ""care bear"" as a parting gift. grandma died well. mother is close. now me.
Wow how paranoid are you?  You are thinking that your doctors would actually refer you, and perform an open heart surgery without it being indicated?  Do you think it is useful to be so distrustful of your health care providers?  I know doctors move quickly and don't take time to explain things.  Believe me, when you already are working very long days and nights and not keeping up, taking more time with each patient is difficult to do.  Nonetheless, doctors got into the business because they are there to help.  Ask questions if you don't understand.  Do your own research and inform yourself about some of the basic workings of your own physiology.  Its one thing to answer questions but sometimes as a health professional, you need to lay a whole ground work with a patient before your answer would make any sense to them.  This is very time consuming.  So learn about yourself and how your heart works if you don't already know.\nTry this link for reliable information\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heart-disease/HB99999\n\nNow to answer your question about the ""silent heart attack.""  We do see this with patients frequently.  There are EKG changes that are consistent with certain parts of the cardiac muscle no longer working.  Other tests (e.g. echocardiograms, myograms)  can give similar results.  My personal feeling about this is that this is either chronically occluded small vessel disease or a congenital defect rather than a full blown event like we typically think of with a heart attack.  This makes the most sense in that over time small vessels become more and more blocked, progressively starving the heart muscle of oxygenated blood.  Eventually an area of the heart dies off.  It happens so slowly that there never is pain, shortness of breath, sweating, etc.  When the area of heart muscle dies, there are changes in monitoring devices like EKG's giving rise to the diagnosis of a ""silent heart attack.""  Whatever the source it means that there is a part of your heart that no longer contracts and pumps blood like it should.  At minimum this predisposes you for congestive heart failure...which has a high incidence of mortality or morbidity.  If I were you, I would listen to the medical people.  Your life and quality of life will depend on it.\n\nGood luck."

I just posted about co-signing for my husband who has horrible credit(25,000).. but got to thinking.  We pay all of our bills on time NOW and he doesn't miss payments.  The debt he has is old debt(charge offs).  I just printed off a report for him on www.freecreditreport.com so I can figure it all out.  Anyways, I want to find debt counseling or a debt consolidation agency that can help him clear it up.  What site can you recommend?\nThanks!
Perhaps instead of a debt consolidation your in need of a credit repair company, as these old debts have been charged-off already.?"
"what is negative energy?
What is negative energy as in terms of physics and warp theory?
Negative energy can refer to several concepts:\n\n    * Negative rest energy, which corresponds to negative mass, which has many unusual physical consequences.\n    * Energy in any system below the conventionally-defined ground state. Examples are positrons under the dirac sea model of electron behavior, and the region of reduced vacuum energy associated with the Casimir effect. This type of effect typically occurs under exotic or unexpected conditions, as the definition of the ground state is usually chosen because it is the state of lowest expected energy within a system.\n    * Energy in any system below an arbitrarily defined zero level. Examples include electron potential energy within an atom under the Bohr model of atomic structure, and gravitational potential energy in Newton's model of gravity."

"Why do some people think that Muslim women with Hijab are scary??
everyone have their right to choose their own religion which they believe on & follow it ....but why some people are being so rude and selfish for making them stop being what they are???
Assalamoalakum Sister,\n\nIf they think women in hijab are scary, they have a lot of issues. Women with hijab are the most trust-worthy women on the planet. If American women were to be friends with a woman wearing a hijab, they would never have to worry about their husbands looking at us. lol. I am an American woman who wears hijab, and to be honest, it doesn't bother me when I get stared at, or when people don't want to be friends with me. If they don't want to befriend me because I'm wearing a hijab, then they are bigotted and selfish. And look at the friends they are going to pick. They won't have the morals of Muslim women, that's for sure. And wearing the hijab is a great way to sort out who your real friends are. Your real friends, whether Muslim or not, will love you and accept you for who you are completely. The truth is that people in non-Muslim countries won't be satisfied with us until we become like western women, and since we never will become like western women, they will never be happy with us. The best thing to worry about is whether Allah is happy with us. That is the most important thing, sister. Assalamoalakum, Sis Safiyah"
"Starting a Forex Trading Business?????
I have this business plan, ambition and passion to create this business that specializes in investing clients funds and then giving them relatively high returns on a daily/weekly/monthly basis depending on what ""program"" they invested in. It is similar to a HYIP but this will be actually based on Forex trading. I lost A lot of money to SCAMMERS out there and i believe everything happens for a reason. It took me 18 years to find out my passion but i know what i want to do with my life. So i'm asking for your thoughts and if it is possible, and if so, what is the profits scale depending on amout invested by the public? \n\nIf you want a copy of the business plan, or a little biography (12 pages) about my history, dreams, and current situation, please feel free to email me, and upon request, i will give you a copy.\n\nAnything you could respond with will be highly appriciated.\n\nRichard Axton\n\n(future ceo or president of YaYarea Investment Company (c) )
I trade 4x myself.\n\nThe first question I would ask you if I was an investor is, ""Show me your results"".\n\nSecondly, if you are so good at making money for yourself, which you should be to invest others' money, then why are you wasting your time asking for money rather than using that time making money for yourself.\n\n(I find most fund managers' performance is mediocre or bad. If they were good at it, they would spend their time doing it on their own account. So, I will NEVER use a fund manager.)\n\nSo your business plan is rather irrelevant; you need a good trading track record to persuade clients to invest their money with you."

"How do radical Muslims rationalize natural disasters in their own part of the world?
Radical Muslims have made many pronouncements that natural disasters in America, such as Hurricane Katrina, are God's punishment for our ""sins.""  But they are silent about such things as the tsunami in Indonesia and earthquakes in Iran and Pakistan, which killed tens of thousands of Muslims.  Do you think they recognize the illogic of their viewpoint?
Even the general Muslim population are living a myth.  The so-called religion is only divisive, and anything that divides us as people cannot be construed as religion, ever.\n\nThe word pure simply means whole, honest, without blemish, without flaw, real, genuine.\n\nReligion attempts to formulate our relationships with one another and with God. Relationships are real. Prophets are concerned about how we treat one another and get along with one another. People come closer to God by coming closer to one another.\n\nChurches are big on preaching what to do, but churches (all of them) are human institutions and flawed. Churches are often the worst when it comes to practicing what is preached.\n\nSo a true prophet is interested in our relationships, and in people. Churches are interested in the business side, the money, the rules, the restrictions. God never intended to start any business.\n\nThe so called Muslim religion as practiced is a distortion and an anamoly.  It is not religion in the better sense of the use of the word.  Any time we purport to hurt someone, anyone, that cannot be justified ever."
"A yo check this out. seriously though.?
Now, i read somewhere that Noahs son was cursed for something he did to Noah and his name was Ham i think anyway, a curse was placed on him and all of his decendants(this being black people). this would be the theory behind the black mans and womens struggle.
i think the problem with modern black people in america has nothing to do with noah but a lot more to do with inheriting a crisis of wealth disparity,\n\nexample,  home ownership in black america is significantly less then the overall american average, american average is like 75% and the black american average is like 55% -60%.  So the first thing blacks did in america was get out of slavery,\nthe second thing was political freedoms, like not riding in the back of the bus and not being denied their vote, and becoming members of the jury,\n\nnow there is an economic problem that blacks face.  Financial independence.  Many go to get good paying jobs and home owners.  Others turn to a life of drugs and crime and end up dead or in jail.  One doesn't have to be white or black to notice that at some places they just don't go at night because theres a creepy guy at the door that every few minutes someone comes running up to.\n\nThe problem of drugs affects whites and blacks.  The problem of the home owndership, this is specific to blacks, and they will need to address this in their own community.  Why and what is the solution I dont know.  To suggest a myth of someone named noah or his son has anything to do with modern society, this I know isn't part of it. ANd it weakens the effort to fix the disparity."

"Son with depression when is it normal and when does he need help?
I have a 14 year old who easily has been suffering from depression a majority of his life.  I think based upon the death of his sister when he was 3, and has just grown from there.  I have tried giving him herbs. Treating him for hyperhomocysteinemia with vitamins, and also learned much about mental therapy on my own in the last 14 years which Ive used to try to help him.  But...\n\nHe is not getting better, and now going into his teenage years I am worried that it will get out of control somewhere soon.  \n\nIs it time for help?  Or am I missing something.  And does counceling ever help?
The time for help is when you recognize that there is a problem.  Get him into treatment now.  Keep in mind that it sometimes takes a few tries to find the right psychiatrist and therapist.  It took me 4 tries to find the right one.  Also, since he has had the depression for so long, make sure he has a complete physical and is checked for everything that could cause the depression.  Some physical causes are underactive thyroid or vitamin deficiency (particularly Vitamin B).  There are others that his doctor should know about.  Counseling alone will probably not help your son since his depression does not appear to be situational."

"What does general anesthesia feel like?
I'm getting general anethesia for arthoscopic knee surgery and am totally freaked out.
It's no big deal.  You literally just go to sleep almost instantly.  When you wake up, you'll be groggy- sorta like you've gotten up 2 hours early.  It's different than being sleepy- you literally can wake up, make a comment or have a short conversation, and !plop! you fall back asleep.  I've never understood why, but your head feels really HEAVY right afterwards.  When you raise it to look around, I swear, it feels like you're picking up a 16-pound bowling ball.  Doesn't hurt- just HEAVY.\n\nThey will normally wake you up right after the procedure- before you're taken back to your room.  You may or may not remember this.  You'll awake to a nurse tapping your cheeks calling your name.  Once they see you're awake, they let you go back to sleep- which takes like 1 second....and you'll wake up in your room.\n\nI glanced at some of the answers here & some are ridiculious.

Your male partner is obviously doing it wrong.  Virgins have a layer of skin that protects the vagina called the heimin.  The pain and pressure you are feeling is from the penis pushing on it.  One of the resons it hurts so much is that you are not relaxed enough... and because you are not ready to give away your virginity.  Another reason is you may not be wet enough and the penis is just ripping you inside.  You should just wait to be married first, this way you know it is right for you and you will be able to concentrate on the act of making love.  Oh, and the heimin will be much thinner due to the fact your body will have produced the proper fluids to help disolve it."

Chordomas are rare. They are a type of malignant tumor that is slow growing but very invasive, which means they have a tendency to spread and invade surrounding tissue and organs.  They are located in the sella turcica, a small depression on the surface of the sphenoid bone (in the skull) which houses the pituitary gland.

Q:20) If y is directly proportional to √x,\nthen y = k√x, where k is a constant.\n\nWe can now find this constant\nbecause we are given y = 4 when x = 16.\n\nSubstituting gives: 4 = k * √16.\nTherefore, k = 4 / √16 = 4 / 4 = 1.\nI'm keeping it simple, so I'll just use the\npositive value. As you know, √16 = ± 4.\n\nNow that we know k = 1,\nthe equation is : y = √x.\n\na) p inversely proportional to q, means p = k / q.\nSubstituting the known values gives : 8 = k / 5\nTherefore, k = 5 * 8 = 40\nand the equation is : p = 40 / q.\nI think you mean ""find p when q is 10"".\np = 40 / 10 = 4.\n\nb) In this problem, yn means ""the new y""\nand xn means ""the new x""\n.\ny = k / x^2, because y varies inversely as x^2.\n\ni) If x is multiplied by 2, then :\nyn = k / (2x)^2 = k / (4x^2) = (k / x^2)(1 / 4) = y / 4.\nThe effect on y is that it is divided by 4,\nor 4 times less than the original.\n\nii) The original equation is y = k / x^2.\nWe need to turn it around to find x.\nTherefore, x = √(k / y).\nNow, if y is divided by 9, then :\nxn = √[k / (y / 9)] = √(9k / y) = 3√(k / y) = 3x.\n(Notice I used only the positive value of √9.)\nThe effect on x is that it is multiplied by 3,\nor 3 times more than the original."

"Is it wrong to paint/draw pictures of Jesus when none of us know what he really looks like? nor the apostles?
Now I'm not Christian, but I've been to a few churches in my life and I always see pictures of what is supposed be Jesus. I do beleive in the birth and the life of Jesus; that he'd cure the blind and heal the lepers and all that great stuff; and he had a great message. My point is that people will always argue about what Jesus looks like,but no one knows, no one has saw him in the flesh, so why do people think that it's okay to make potraits and say that it is Jesus. Please tell me.

"Is it possible that you can get sick with the stomach flu again a week later?
symptoms:\nfever\ncoughing\npuking\ntiredness\ndirrehha\nnot hungry much
The stomach flu is caused by norovirus. norovirus is a pretty big family of viruses. Similarly to the common cold, if you get noro once, chances are you will run into it again but in a form just different enough to be unfamiliar to your immune system. Then you get sick again, and it's no fun.\n\nPredominant symtpoms of norovirus infection are diarrhea, vomiting and cramps. Fevers are rare and usually low. Also, people tend to feel tired and lose their appetites. Doctors often misdiagnose norovirus because not very many labs will test for it. Oftentimes, people who get sick with noro don't even bother seeing a doctor because the sickness lasts 1 or 2 days.\n\nNoro is EXTREMELY contagious. The virus particles can aerosolize when you are vomiting or having diarrhea. This can contaminate a bathroom and get other people (who share your bathroom) ill. If you are sick with norovirus, you must wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water. Disinfect any rooms contaminated with diarrhea or vomit using a bleach solution. And don't touch other people's food!\n\nThere is no cure for norovirus. You cannot take antibiotics for it. You simply have to keep hydrated and wait for it to go away."

"are there any snakes in the world that do not have sex to reproduce?

Some reptile species are parthenogenetic (from Greek: virgin + originate, generate). That is, the development of the ovum can be triggered without sperm intervention.\nAs a consequence, these populations are only formed by females and all the offspring are genetically identical to their mothers (unless there is some recombination at cross-over, which I'm not sure about). \nThere are only a few lizards and snakes that present this mechanism; see the links below for the best known parthenogenetic snake species (there are probably others that have not been studied yet). \nHere in Argentina we have some parthenogenetic lizards! :)"

I would not limit yourself to homeopathic approaches.  I would look for a doctor with a holistic approach to treating patients.

There are many approaches, depending on lab tests and physical examination findings, that can help to support the neurological tissues.  Look for a company on the web called Standard Process.

"How do you differentiate real marble from man made marble and fake marble?
I've been trying to get ideas in the net on learning if your marble furniture is pure or fake. they say that real marble is really cold even when the temperature is hot. Does that also apply to furniture i.e. marble top dining table? How do I know if I have a fake one or a real one?
Real marble is mainly calcium carbonate. Marble is limestone or dolomite that has been metamorphosed with heat and pressure. Pure calcite marble is white, but impurities produce a wide variety of colouring and patterns. The marble can not withstand sudden changes in temperature (it's colder than the environment), humidity, presence sulphurous gas in the atmosphere. To test if it's a real marble do a test in a small, hidden area: apply one drop of weak acid with eyedropper. Acid will fizz on contact with real marble.\nCaCO2 + HCl = CaCl2 + H2O + CO2\nThe test produces the characteristic fizz from the release of carbon dioxide only on calcium based stone, i.e., marble. The acid will not fizz on quartz or silicate-base (granite) stone, nor on synthetic material.\nCultured marble is a mixture of resin and ground marble. It is less expensive alternative to natural marble. \nFake marble or faux marble is a painting technique, it means the painting of painting surfaces so as to imitate the appearance of polished marble. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive.\nScagliola is a technique for producing plasterwork columns, sculptures, and other architectural elements that resemble marble.\nArtificial marble contains a polymer / monomer, mica flakes, glass flakes, resin and other components, it is used for kitchen worktops because it is heat and scratch proof and chemically resistive. Marbelite is a synthetic, mouldable, artificial marble. Marbelite is made by heating potassium alum in water then added 10% heavy spar and marble dust. Synthetic materials may have lower initial costs but lose their gloss quickly and must be restored with waxes or finishes which give an artificial  look.\nIn the construction trade, the term ""marble"" is used for any massive, crystalline calcitic or non-calcitic rock useful as building stone."

"How to I clear out my Lungs?
Recently I quit smoking.  The ordeal has been one of the most trying of my life.  Not because of withdrawal.  The withdrawal symptoms were totally dwarfed by the physical pain and suffering that my body has put me through in the process of healing.  Mostly, it was an extremely swollen (as in visibly to other people) throat.  Now that that's passed i keep coughing up stuff.  gross stuff.  I understand that this is normal however i just started a new job, so i need to expedite the process of clearing out my lungs so i can stop coughing.  i use vapo rub at night and breath hot steam regularly to help break everything up.  Is there something else that could help?  Something that works quickly?  Thanks!\n(p.s. if u planning on advising cough drops, please move on and get Ur points somewhere else)
Go to your chemist and buy some Bronchial mixture. Its a thick brown horrible goo that you drink, and while you are taking it you will be constantly coughing up crap. But it is very effective in letting you get all the gunk out of your lungs."
"How can i?
I really need to lose weight about 15-20 pounds. What kind of\nexercise should i do?
Avoid white foods as they are high in carbs.  Eat lots of raw vegetables.  Eat 6 small meals a day to keep your metabolism going.  Skipping meals causes your body to try and store calories.\n\nDo aerobic exercise in 18 minute segments and don't eat for an hour following this.  Bicycling, swimming, running, elyptical trainers are all good aerobic exercise choices.\n\nLift weights too.  The more muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns."
"Evolution proves the non-existance of God?
I believe in evolution and yes I believe in God.  I just dont get why people from both sides of the equation feel that you have to have one or the other.  Could it be both are right and both are wrong in some aspects? \n\nI find it ludicrous that the religious side feels that evolution threatens the existance of God and atheists feel this solidifies their argument to the non-existence of God and it somehow strengthens their argument.\n\nBoth are wrong really, its been scientifically proven evolution exists.  God is a little harder to prove.  However I pose this to atheists...if science and evolution proves their thought on the non-existance of God then tell me where in the science of the entire universe has anything ever evolved from nothing?  Fact is, nothing!  So there your argument that we evolved from nothing proves irrelevant. Nothing in this universe comes from nothing.  Can both sides please try to be a little more open minded and atleast agree with me somewhat?
No evolution does not disprove god.  But it does pose a very large challenge.  Evolution and Christianity are not as compatible as you may think.  If evolution is the correct theory, then that means that the literalist biblical theory is not right.  Sure you might be able to save it by saying that it is metaphorically true (say, a day to god equals a billion years or whatever).  But if some parts of the bible are not literally true, then why think that any of it is literally true?  Jesus, God, etc. can all be seen as being metaphors for the natural world and the human condition.  With no way to really tell what is literally true and what is metaphorically true, allowing that at least some of it is not literally makes the rest questionable.  If one part is not true, or only becomes true if you take it as a metaphor, what does that say about the rest?  What the bible says then cannot be believed just because it is in the bible anymore, and one of the central justifications of christianity crumbles.  of course god can still exist, but its a major challenge.\n\nOk as for your other question about how can an atheist account for the existence of anything without a God:  all i have to do is ask you where god came from.  Did god come from nothing?  Was he always there?  If you say god came from nothing, then you violate your own rule that nothing can come from nothing.  If you say he was always there, then why can't the atheist just say that the universe was always here?  Why can't the atheist just say that the universe always existed?  Its more likely (by occam's razor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor ) than the belief that god was always there.  Religion doesn't answer the question of where things came from, it only begs the question of where god came from.  Under the religous explanation nothing is really explained.\n\nI admire your call to tolerance and hope of compatibility, but i'm afraid its nothing more than political correctness.  It would be nice if both sides could be right, but when you think about it there really is a tension."

but I don't want to pay a volunteer agency thousands of dollars to locate an organization that needs my help.  Volunteering should be free!  Does anybody know of any organizations that could use a helping hand that I could contact directly?
I have the perfect solution for you: Mãos Que Ajudam or ´Helping Hands,´ a volunteer service organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Brazil. They are always in the need of an extra help throughout all of Brazil including Rio. Theyve gone to other countries to give service like Indonesia to help there too, while their main focus is Brazil. Check out their website - and if you need it in English, the translation will be poor, but  altavista is worth a shot. \n I cannot stress enough that this organization has been extraordinarily successful and done a great deal of good for many people with many needs. Their achievements have been no less than amazing.\n Now there´s a contact page (contato) that will assume that you are a resident of Brazil. I don´t know exactly how a foreigner to Brazil could get involved, but if you fill out the basic info under ´empresa´ instead, they will contact you, (you can ask for an English speaker if you don´t speak Portuguese, I just hope they´d have one), and you can get connected with them. An even easier idea would be to contact the email of the personnel at the bottom of their webpage with all your questions.\n I hope that this was a help for you and that you´ll be able to find a way to get involved as a volunteer here in Brazil. We need you! Thank you."
"Is there a word for the phenomenon of seeing images of faces in things? i.e., clouds, wood paneling, etc.?

Responses without sources aren't answers, just opinions.\n\nAnthropomorphism, a form of personification (applying human or animal qualities to inanimate objects) and similar to prosopopoeia (adopting the persona of another person), is the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, natural, or supernatural phenomena. Animals, forces of nature, and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis."
"How does a person's immune system know to produce antibodies when it first encounters a new virus?

Through a series of steps called the immune response, the immune system attacks organisms and substances that invade our systems and cause disease. The immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body.\n\nThe cells that are part of this defense system are white blood cells, or leukocytes (pronounced: loo-kuh-sytes). They come in two basic types (more on these below), which combine to seek out and destroy the organisms or substances that cause disease. \nThe leukocytes circulate through the body between the organs and nodes by means of the lymphatic (pronounced: lim-fah-tik) vessels. (You can think of the lymphatic vessels as a type of highway between the rest stops that are the lymphoid organs and lymph nodes). Leukocytes can also circulate through the blood vessels. In this way, the immune system works in a coordinated manner to monitor the body for substances that might cause problems.A foreign substance that invades the body is called an antigen (pronounced: an-tih-jun). When an antigen is detected, several types of cells work together to recognize and respond to it. These cells trigger the B lymphocytes to produce antibodies. Antibodies are specialized proteins that lock onto specific antigens. Antibodies and antigens fit together like a key and a lock.Once the B lymphocytes have produced antibodies, these antibodies continue to exist in a person's body. That means if the same antigen is presented to the immune system again, the antibodies are already there to do their job.Although antibodies can recognize an antigen and lock onto it, they are not capable of destroying it without help. That is the job of the T cells. The T cells are part of the system that destroys antigens that have been tagged by antibodies or cells that have been infected or somehow changed. (There are actually T cells that are called ""killer cells""). T cells are also involved in helping signal other cells (like phagocytes) to do their jobs.\n\nAntibodies can also neutralize toxins (poisonous or damaging substances) produced by different organisms. Lastly, antibodies can activate a group of proteins called complement that are also part of the immune system. Complement assists in killing bacteria, viruses, or infected cells.\n\nAll of these specialized cells and parts of the immune system offer the body protection against disease. This protection is called immunity. Humans have three types of immunity - innate, adaptive, and passive."

"is it possible???
is it possible to be so depressed, so sick of life, that you could go to sleep and not wake up?  is it possible that mental pain could end up being the cause of your death?
I don't think that it is possible for this to actually end your life. \nPerhaps ther are points of such great stress in everyones life (some will experience greater stress than others) where they wish that once their head hit the pillow their problems ended. It is possible though that stress related issues could be the cause of death since intense mental stress has very physical side affects on the person which can lead to death depending on how long the sttress related illness lasts and whether it is a deteriorating condition. But its more than likely that the person would simply get much worse before they got better.\nSo it is possible that mental pain can lead to death (only through the physical manifestation of the stress) but it is not a very likely scenario despite the amount of stress. The person in question would perhaps have to be somewhat weak physically initially.\nHope this sorta answers this one :)"
"sex education for young people: a) helps them make good informed choices? b) just gives them ideas?
which one and why?
Definitely choice A!  Sex can be good and bad, like so many things in life.  If young people aren't prepared for it, it will end up being a bad thing.\n\nI often compare sex to fire.  Both are very good things that are necessary for survival, but only when one knows how to properly use them and take adequate precautions against any hazards.  Most of the hazards brought on by fire will never be faced by the majority of children.  This is probably because they are educated about it early in life (""Don't play with matches"" ""Stay away from the stove!"" ""Only YOU can prevent forest fires!""  ""Stop, drop and roll."" etc) and come to respect it.  And yet, when educating children about the dangers of fire, I have never heard someone say, ""Hey...maybe we shouldn't teach them about this...they might get ideas and try to burn down the house.""  The same principle should be applied to sex ed.  Who knows?  Maybe there would be less STDs and teen pregnancies if children were educated about it before they got the drive to have sex.  Too many are simply unprepared because people don't want to give them ideas."
"Should there be stricter guidelines for this forum?
I am against censorship in principle, but shouldn't there should be at least some boundries?
This is NOT a freedom of speech issue. No one has the right to publish on Answers. It would be like sending an article to a newspaper and demanding that they print it because you think that's ""free speech."" The newspaper has the right to refuse to publish obscene, racist, vile, reprehensible material -- as well as any other material. Yahoo! owns this site and has the right to decide what stays and what goes. If you want true freedom of speech, create your own web site.\n\nBut, that said, I don't think Yahoo! does a good enough job of monitoring this site and enforcing the guidelines they do have. Until they can maintain the current guidelines, which are really the bare minimum for civil discourse, I don't think they should be stricter."

"I have a back pain and I went to the hositpal to have an x-ray done. what could my problem be?
what would the cause be in back pain.
The causes of back pain can be mechanical, meaning from your bones, muscles, or joints, or it could be organic in nature.  That means that the pain is being caused by something more internal that is referring pain to the back.  Kidney infection, or stones will commonly refer pain to the back.  One simple way to help determine if the pain is more mechanical in nature is to see if you can find a comfortable position to get into.  If you can, then the pain is probably from an injury to your spinal joints or a sprained muscle.  Did you notice anything that might have caused a sprained back?  For example heavy lifting.  Disc hernitations are common and can cause serious back pain.  You can not see a disc herniation on an x-ray.  You need an MRI for that.  If you went to the hospital, assuming the ER, they are concerned mostly about a fracture or other serious pathology.  \nIf you have a primary doctor go see him or her.  You can also seek out a chiropractor.  Either will help you understand the cause of your pain."

False. It is actually the opposite - fermentation is ""anaerobic"" respiration, which means ""without oxygen."" In yeast, they convert glucose (sugar) to ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide when there is no oxygen. It is how they break down glucose to get energy. In muscles, a similar process occurs when they are working so hard that they use oxygen up too quickly, but still need energy. In this case, glucose is broken down to lactic acid."

"Does anyone have sponsorship and fund raising idea's to raise money to send my daughter to Europe to study?
Hello everyone. My 10 year old daughter was accepted for a U.S. Ambassador program. She will be ""hopefully"" going to England/Scotland this summer for 20 days to study. She will earn college credit for this trip. The problem is this will cost almost $6,000.00. This is way to good of an oppertunity for me to let her pass up she may never have this chance again. Does anyone know of a company that will sponsor her if she wears their clothes, gives them a speech or report when she returns, etc? What about other ways we could raise the money ourselves. We are willing to work hard for this. She has never wanted anything so bad and has said she wants nothing for her birthday and Christmas just to put the money away for the trip. If anyone could give me some help or advice I would be forever in your debt. Thank you so much for your time and in advance for your help. Robin
Contact the Chamber of Commerce, there bound to be businesses who will be too happy to sponsor a cause such as your daughter's opportunity to learn and experience other cultures.  In return you and your family can speak of the businesses in a complementary manner as a pseudo advertisement.  If the Chamber of Commerce cannot help, contact individual businesses.  When you do get sponsors, make sure to even print out posters how helpful the businesses were in sponsoring your daughters Ambassadorship trip."
"are you an alcoholic even though you don't drink alone?

Most professionals would answer yes, IF one meets other criteria.  Obviously quantity of alcohol consumption, frequency, and other deeper psychological factors (what triggers the drinking, impact on relationships, etc).  \nBasically if alcohol is interfering with a ""normal"" lifestyle (which mind you, is subjective) then you're probably an alcoholic."
"I have a hysterectomy scheduled in 2 days and I just started my period, will I have to reschedule?

Although I'd talk to your doctor, it shouldn't prevent your surgery.  Many doctors are completely comfortable doing a hysterectomy even during menstruation.  It really doesn't affect your chances of success and doesn't make it any harder for the doc.  Many women who come in for hysterectomies are bleeding for various reasons.  Just let your doc know your situation and let her decide."

"I have low blood sugar, what are the best foods for me to eat and what are the ones I should avoid?

if you have occasional episodes of low blood sugar, then a glass of milk and digestive biscuit will higher it. Don't go mad eating sweet stuff to get it up, as it doesn't take alot. a glass of 7up either will do the trick. Are you an actual diabetic or simply prone to getting low blood sugar levels? Keep an eye on your levels and ensure you eat enough in the day. You may be exercising alot and not eating enough to replace the energy lost. have a chat with your practice nurse."

Sometimes the foods you eat can come out through your pores in a bad odor. Try to keep up with what you eat, and see if there is anything that may be causing it in the food area. \n\n(1)Does diet affect body odor?\n\nAlcohol, spicy foods, garlic, cumin, caffeine and hot drinks can all cause us to sweat more. \n\nMedical conditions that change the way we smell:\n\nDisease: if your body smell changes it can be a sign of disease. Diabetics, especially those who use insulin to control their levels of sugar, can smell of acetone (nail-varnish remover). Such individuals require urgent medical attention. People with liver disorders may smell of ammonia and people with yeast infections can smell of beer. Digestive problems can make us smell, but it usually is not a sweat problem and has more to do with gas.\n\nFever makes people sweat more so body odor can be a problem. Night sweats can be due to T.B. Malaria and cancers such as leukaemia or lymphoma can also produce unusual or perfuse sweats. Anyone concerned about the changes in body odor or sweat patterns should seek medical attention.\n\nDrugs: body odor can be caused by the excessive sweating that is a side effect of medication. Some anti-psychotic medications, morphine, high doses of the hormone thyroxin and overdoses of analgesics such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol,etc) are all known to cause body odor.\n\nAnxiety: when emotions run high the body prepares itself for a 'fight or flight' response. This is a physiological state in which body prepares itself for action. Often we can neither fight nor escape situations that cause anxiety but our bodies still react as though preparing for action. We all sweat during states of arousal even in tiny amounts. This is the basis of measures used in galvanic skin response test used, for example, in lie detectors or with biofeedback equipment.\n\nHeredity: there are some people inherit a tendency to sweat more than others. Excessive sweating is known as hyperhidrosis.\n\nAn inability or reduced ability to sweat is called anhidrosis. It can be a life threatening condition. A hereditary disorder called hypohidrotic ectodermal dyspalsia (HED) means some children are born without sweat glands so are unable to control their body temperature. Burn victims, where large areas of the body is involved, can also have problems with body temperature regulation.\n\nHas being smelly always been social unacceptable?\n\nTricky question. There must have been a time when social or climatic conditions meant that body smells were tolerated more than they are today. Hygeine is now associated with either a lack of smell or the use of perfumed odors. Good water supplies, close working conditions, the media and social trends have, over time, combined to change what is acceptable and desirable.\n\nWhat decides whether a man’s smell is sexy or offensive?\n\nThis is very subjective although there is some evidence that women may be slightly more receptive to natural male odors at certain times of the month. People do seem to be attracted by some natural body odors but not others. Stale sweat is, for most people, a turn off except in intimate moments of short duration!\n\nGeneral hygienic hints to stop nasty niffs\n\nDaily (or more frequent) showers, soap, changing your clothes frequently, (a few times a day if you sweat excessively), choosing natural fiber clothing and changing your diet will all help to get rid of body odor. We spend millions of dollars on deodorants and antiperspirants and it has made a huge difference to the way we smell, but if your trainers stink, well, it's money wasted.\n\n(2) Supplements\nChlorophyll One or two chlorophyll tablets or chlorophyll liquid taken with each meal may also help, as chlorophyll is a great deodorizer. \n\nMagnesium Take magnesium supplements or augment your diet with food sources high in this important mineral. Between 200-500 mg of magnesium have been recommended. You will have to try different doses u"
"Comments on Natural Appetite Suppressants..?
Is it effective? Have you used it, what was the result? Any side effects? Name some brands
I do not use appetite suppressants, but here's an idea. Eat small amounts throughout the day. (up to 6 times) This will help you to keep your metabolism going through out the day and will not let you get ""starving"". That is when you eat everything in sight. If you're never hungry, then you will eat healthier portion sizes. I eat more now AND weigh less just by changing the amount of times/sizes of what i eat.\n\nAlso, i have tried the likes of Xenadrine and Hydroxycut. They were supposed to make you burn fat and curb your appetite, but i was still hungry... They made me jittery."

"Can drinking 2 glasses of slim milk everyday sustain my supply of calcium?

"Why do some places get thunderstorms in the morning and others get thunderstorms in the afternoon and at night

It depends on the current weather pattern and the stability of the atmosphere.  Typically thunderstorms occur in the late afternoon and evening in most places because the heat from sunlight along with humidity and other meteorological factors.  But all of this can also occur at night.  It just seems that the atmosphere needs to remain unstable once the sun goes down, which usually doesn't happen, but is never out of the question."
"Do epson salt baths really detox the body?  What is the deal with coffee baths too?
I hear stuff about it, but never tried it, but if it works, shoot I""m game...
Yes, Epsom salt baths can help detox the body. The salts support and enhance the bodies’ immune response by stimulating lymph and blood circulation. The key ingredient is magnesium, which regulates a couple hundred enzymatic responses in the body. \n\nAlso, according to the Epsom Salt Council:\n""Epsom Salt also delivers sulfates, which medical research indicates are needed for the formation of brain tissue, joint proteins and the mucin proteins that line the walls of the digestive tract. Studies show that sulfates also stimulate the pancreas to generate digestive enzymes and help to detoxify the body's residue of medicines and environmental contaminants. Studies indicate that sulfates are difficult to absorb from food, but are readily absorbed through the skin.""\n\nI use a footbath of hot water, epsom salts, and herbs/spices every time I feel a cold coming on, with great results.\n\nI would not take a coffee bath unless you're willing to deal with side effects -- that much caffeine absorbed through the skin would be a lot for the body to deal with."

"Ratio of Joan to Ben's age is 3:2. 15 yrs ago, Ben was 3 times as old as Joan was then. How old are they now?

This is only possible if Ben has been travelling at near the speed of light for the last 15 years and has only aged 3 years while back on earth Joan has aged 15 years \n\nHe was 9 and she was 3.\nNow he is 12 and she is 18.\n\nAlternatively his birthday is Feb 29th and the 15 years includes only 3 leap years, he is therefore only  3 birthdays older, while she has had 15 birthdays\n\nOr Ben comes from Planet Zog which takes 5 earth years to rotate around the Zoggian Sun. He started at age 9 Zog Years and Joan started at age 3 Earth Years. Now he is 12 Zoggian Years old and she has got the key of the door having just turned 18.\n\nOr he was 9 in 1991, she was 3.

"Please advice me on this one!?
It's more than four years since I graduated from high school, but I still feel like a school kid at times like this. There is a party happening tonight for a friend of mine who's tying the knot soon. Most of my school friends will be there, but I've totally branched out from them so much that I don't like their company anymore. These friends of mine didn't really complete school as they left after the tenth or eleventh grade. They did other studies, got married and have their own families now. They are all comfortably off. And, in the meantime, I carved my own niche of friends and work that I'm comfortable with, and I feel uncomfortable meeting my old friends after such a long time. It's like we have NOTHING in common now. To make matters work, I'm single. A few friends have commented on it in the past, and it really hurt me although I didn't show it. Contrary to what they think, I really am sought after, but I'm picky about my choice of mate. They just think I'm a failure.\nHelp me!
we all grow up [or at leat, that what is suppose to happen] So, do not feel guilty of growing up and becoming a mature individual whose priorities has changed over time.  This is how it ought to be. When we were children, we did the things children do and viewed the world with much immaturity.  But as we grow, we find that those things that were so important to us at the time, hardly has any value now.  So, if your friends perhaps have been stuck in a childhood bubble, [and if they willingly want to be there] leave them there and move on with your life.  Do what pelases you, as long as you live in harmony with God and your fellow-man.\nIIf your old friends cannot respect this, it solves the problem for you, isn't it?"

"What were some  effects that Great Britain's colonial rule had on the colonial empire?
postive effects\n\nnegative effects
What colonial empire are you specifically referring too? Their empire was so vast that each inidividual colony had distinct differences. Big differences between India vs. America colonies for example. Different cultures, different climates, etc.\n\nAs for the American colonies, the effects were mostly negative for the American people, that is why the Revolutionary War began. High taxes upon the people, limited land expansion for Americans, subjected to English law, etc. \nThe ONLY positive effect the British had on American soil was perhaps the modernization of the country. The British introduced many modern conveniences that were foreign to Americans at the time.\n\nBritish rule in India was much different. The Indian people were treated as slaves. Their lives were torn apart by British rule. However, modern medicine was introduced to India by way of British rule and therefore many lives were saved."
"What do you think of global warming?
Global warming is the gradual increase in the earth's surface temperature. Many refuse to believe we are in a serious crisis... so I was wondering what your opinion was.
Well, this has happened at far more rapid rates in the past.  It's also been happening since man first made the wheel.  We just haven't taken notice since the last century.  This is because our pumping of greenhouse gasses and thermal pollution has helped to actually speed it up.  If we want to avert this from happening so fast we need to switch to cleaner fuels, such as fuel cell mechanics.  Though this can be a dangerous thing as well.  Fuel cells work by passing hydrogen through a mesh to join with oxygen and create water.  Now this creates a current in this mesh, and can be captured to use in many electric devices, including electric cars.  Now the problem is that by using this method of energy we need to convert water into oxygen and h2, but if we accidently have the hydrogen leak from a tank it will leave our atmosphere.  Once there isn't enough hydrogen to combine with the oxygen then we have wasted the water, and make an excess of oxygen in the atmosphere.  Too much oxygen in the atmosphere will trigger more wildfires, only to creat e more greenhouse gasses."

actually earth is part of Sun which was separated away since millions of years,, then slowly cooled down...shell hardened and\nland and sea,,...lives form...who wants to argue ??
earth is obviously created ""naturally"", in my opinion, there is no such thing as god, rather, earth was created coincidentally.\n\nwhen the solar system is formed, little bits of the sun is trapped by its own gravity, because they were fluid, they formed spheres, this explains why planets are round and not triangular. earth was one of them, it was once small and in habitable, it is only by chance an asteroid nearly the size of earth than collided and fused with earth, readjusting its orbit, size and atmosphere, this also provided the optimal conditions for simple organisms to form out of chemical reactions between chemicals found in the sea together with other natural phenomena like lightnings.\n\ngod had no hand in this, rather, god was created by man"
"is there a diffrence between DARK MATER & DARK ENERGY ?

Well current thinking is yes but since we dont know what either of them are we cant be sure. The reason for there existence is that we have calculated that there should be a lot more matter and energy in the universe than we have observed. All the observable matter and energy makes up only 5% of the energy of the universe with Dark Matter making up 25% and Dark Energy making up around 70%. These two were though up at different times and thus are considered seperate. Dark Matter is believed to surround galaxies and fill that space and it helps to explain some of the rotational aspects of other galaxies. Dark Energy is believed to be a sort of ever present thing in the entirety of empty space. Discovering the constituents of these two things is one of the greatest feats modern physics is trying to discover. They may turn out to be the same thing but all we know now is that they are invisible to us and that they make up most of the universe's mass and energy"
"i have unexplained abdominal cramps that my dr is clueless about dose any one have any idea or had this prob.?

I have had this in the past, and still do sometimes. Does it get worse with stress? If so, it might be something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (spastic colon). you can suggest this to your doctor and see what he/she thinks, they can run tests to find out if this is your problem, and give you medicine to help with the symptoms, but don't expect it to be cured or to go away until you get rid of the stress causing factor in your life, or find other ways to releive the stress, or learn how to handle it better...but eventually, you'll be able to get by without the medicine, especially if you eliminate the stress, or find ways to lessen it. Don't let your doctor do to you what mine did to me...mine ran up a $1000 plus bill on me (even though I had insurance that covered 80%, the $1000 was my 20%), and never diagnosed me with anything being wrong until one day I suggested to her that it might be IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), and she agreed and gave me medicine that helped me...had I not suggested it, who knows how much more I would have had to pay for getting no diagnosis from her!!! The pain in my abdomen got so severe one day that I passed out in my bathroom floor (that's what made me go to the doctor). I don't like going to doctors because I beleive they don't try to help you when they know they can, and they are overpaid for doing nothing, not to mention the bills they run up on you before diagnosing you."

i have a very nice mom and dad but i cant trust. i cant even trust my best friend why is that ?
trust maybe lost if someone you know quite well has let you down, or if something you werent happy about that happened to you, there are different levels of trust, depends which you lack, if perhaps your boyfriend two timed you, you would find it hard to trust again, if you were assaulted or similar, it would be hard to trust again after that.\n\nor perhaps someone has lied to you, that can also shatter trust, if you have some idea of which trust you lack perhaps someone can give you a more in depth answer.\n\nif something has happened to you, in which you dont trust many people, accept what has happened to you, and try and realise not everyone has or will act that way towards you again, if its boyfriend or friend issues or parent issues, they have to earn trust, best way is to tackle it, identify your specific need. perhaps you are just insecure and you feel everyone is lying to you."

"what is titanium used for? I have a science project to do and I don't know what to say about it.?

Titanium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a light, strong, lustrous, corrosion-resistant (including resistance to sea water and chlorine) transition metal with a white-silvery-metallic colour. Titanium is used in strong light-weight alloys (most notably with iron and aluminium) and its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is used in white pigments. Examples in which white pigment, consisting of titanium oxide, is used, are correction fluid and commonly used white paint to repaint walls. It is also used in toothpaste, white road marking paints and in white fireworks. Substances containing titanium are called titaniferous.\n\nThe element occurs in numerous minerals with the main sources being rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed over the Earth. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element; titanium-46 through titanium-50 with titanium-48 being the most abundant (73.8%). One of titanium's most notable characteristics is that it is as strong as steel but is only 60% its density. Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to zirconium"

"What is the majority sentiment when it comes to the Gospel according to Thomas and other gnostic writings?
Is it true ,in the Gospel according to Thomas ,that it eludes to that fact that Jesus was just a man?
No, Thomas does not allude to the fact that Jesus was just a man.  The concept in fact would be contrary to most Gnostic believes.  Here's a quick quote from Thomas:\n\n(77) Jesus says:\n(1) ""I am the light that is over all. I am the All.\nThe All came forth out of me. And to me the All has come.""\n(2) ""Split a piece of wood – I am there.\n(3) Lift the stone, and you will find me there.""\n\nThomas is a ""sayings gospel.""  Unlike the Gospels that are in the Bible, it has no narrative.  It is just one Jesus quote after another.  Many scholars assign a first century date to Thomas, so it is at least possible that it is very old.\n\nGnostics believe that the material world is evil, and therefore God would never take the form of a man.  Gnostics have what is called a docetic view of Christ.  That is that he only appeared to be human, and had none of the actual physical characteristics of a human.  The goal of Gnostics is to escape the limitations and evil of this physical world and return to the spiritual world they believe we came from.\n\nGnosis.org is a great resource for gnostic information and has several copies of the Gospel of Thomas"
"is Meiosis part of Mitosis, how can i know the difference?
what is Meiosis and Mitosis, please HELP
Mitosis is the reproduction of somatic (body) cells, while meiosis is the production of gametes (sex cells).\n\nThe normal cell has a chromosome number of ""2n"".  For example, a fruit fly has a chromose count of 8, so 8=2n.\n\nFollowing so far? Good.\n\nMitosis:\nMitotic division begins with a cell in Interphase, with a chromosome count of 2n.\nThe chromosomes are not visible right now under the microscope, they just look like a mass of tangled string called chromatin.\n\nIn Prophase, the chromosomes replicate, but remain attatched to their partner by a centromere (kinda look like an x).  Spindle fibres form and the centrioles migrate to the ends of the cell, opposite each other.  Nuclear membrane disappears.\n\nIn Metaphase, the chromosomes line up on the equatorial line (a bunch of x in a row along the middle of the cell), and spindle fibres attatch to each chromatid in the pair (right now, the two parts to the x are individually chromatids, but are together a chromosome).\n\nDuring Anaphase, the spindle fibres pull each daughter chromosome so that the pair of chromatids splits apart and half of them go to one end of the cell, and half to the other.\n\nDuring Telophase, the nucleolus forms and the nuclear membrane forms around the two sets of chromosomes.  A clevage furrow separates the cell into two daughter cells, each having a 2n number of chromosomes.\n\nPhew.  Still following?  Good- that was just Mitosis!\n\nNow for the fun one.  Meiosis.\nMeiosis takes the 2n cell and turns it into FOUR  (4) gametes.\nIn your body, each individual chromosome is part of a homologous pair.  That is, each has a match.  This is why we represent the chromosome number as 2n- There are two sets of n chromosomes.  In our fruit fly, the 2n number is 8, so there are 4 sets of homologous pairs.  Following? Good.\n\nMeiosis in the fruit fly begins with a single cell with 8 chromosomes, and ends with 4 cells with 4 chromosomes each.\n\nWhy does it end with ""n"" instead of ""2n""?  Each gamete provides half the genetic information needed to create the new organism.  You get half your genes from your mother and half from your father.\n\nAnyway, meiosis takes place in two stages: aptly called meiosis 1 and meiosis 2.\n\nMeiosis 1:\nIn Interphase, the cell has roughly the same appearance as it did in Interphase of Mitosis.\n\nIn Prophase 1: The chromosomes duplicate and find their homologous pairs.  Now, the little groups istead of looking like an x, look like an x with four little lines joining, because there are 4 chromatids attached together, called a tetrad.  Understand?  I hope so!\nAt this point, the two chromatids nearest together in the tetrad may ""cross over"".  In other words, they swap genetic information.  Homologous pairs carry similar, but not identical coding (remember one was from your father, one from your mother).  In this way, you now have 4 chromatids that are each unique in their coding, which allows for genetic variation!  \nCentromers go to opposite ends, and spindle fibres begin to form.  Nuclear membrane disappears\n\nIn Metaphase 1: The tetrads line up on the equatorial line (remember this?)  The spindle fibres attatch to each side of the tetrad.\n\nIn Anaphase 1: The spindle fibres split the tetrads in half, so that 2 chromatids (1 chromosome now) go to one pole of the cell, and 2 chromatids (1 chromosome) go to the other.\n\nIn Telophase 1: The nuclear envelope/membrane reappears around each set of chromosomes, and a cleavage furrow splits the cell into two daughter cells.\n\nAt this point, we now have two daughter cells with ""n"" for the chromosome count, because there is half the amount of chromosomes we had when we started!\n\nOk, now each daughter cell undergoes meiosis 2, so that at the end we have 4 gametes.\n\nProphase 2:  Nuclear envelope dissappears.  Centroles migrate to the opposite sides of the cells, spindle fibres form.  Remember that the chromosomes are composed of "
"What is the difference between socialized medicine and universal health care, if there is a difference?
I heard this on ABC news a few weeks ago where some guy was talking about the current state of USA's health care system.  He felt that America could function better if we adopted a system of ""universal coverage.""  He then went on to say that universal coverage didn't mean socialized medicine.\n\nSo what defines universal coverage AND socialized medicine?  Is there a difference between the two?  Which one is right for America?
universal health care means everyone in a country has health insurance (I believe this is the system in Germany). Socialized medicine is where the government owns and runs all the hospitals and pays all the Doctors"

"Do we sin because we are sinners, or are we sinners because we sin? Why?
Does God hate the sinner or the sin?
We sin because we were born in sin and have Adams seed.  When this happens we are considered a sinner.  God does NOT hate the sinner but actually loves them.  He sent his Son to die on the cross to save a person from their sin and restore them into a right relationship with Him.  However, sin is punished and if a person rejects this free gift from God of Jesus they will pay the price for that sin which is eternal seperation from Him.  With acceptance of Jesus and the cleansing of your sin by His blood you are considered sinless in Gods eyes as Jesus paid the price for your sin.  When you do this you can have eternal life with God.  He does not love you more than the sinner He just accepts you back into His presence as Jesus took your sin away."
"Broken Leg...?
OK i am getting ready to get my brace&#92;cast off of my leg i broke it playing volleyball  an almost compound fracture and a smallbreak not all the way through my fibia and im kind of worried because i play softball in the spring and im afraig i will break it just like that again ..is it stronger after it heals or should i take it careful  or what im confused
Your orthopedist will probably take occasional x-rays to monitor the healing process.  While a fracture typically takes about 8 weeks to ""heal""...(by heal, we mean that the two ends of the fractures come together and are now joined), the bone forms a ""callous"" to protect it from injury.  Yet, even with this callous, it is important to know that bone continues to change for about a year after injury...it begins to reorganize the ""callous"" and tries to resume the ""normal"" trabacular and cortical structure of the origional bone.  You may still experience occasional aches and pains during this time, but most likely your orthopedist can examine your x-rays and determine what level of activity you may resume."

"I have oily skin and everytime that I get a pimple, it leaves a dark spot. How can I removed them?

I agree with the answers that say not to pop them.  Here is some food for thought.  The red spots are actually inflamation.  Anytime you have a red spot on your body from whatever cause....it's usually inflamation.  So a good way to combat this is to find ways to stop inflamation in your body.  Now, i had acne for years and people would tell me that the food I ate didn't matter.  However, I think that is BS.  One way to regulate inflamation is by trying to control your blood sugar, eating foods rich in Omega 3 fatty acids (good fat), and avoiding Omega 6 fatty acids (saturated fat).  \n\n1.  Always eat the meat or protien part of your meal first.  This will slow down digestion and help prevent a blood sugar ""spike.""  Also, look at the glycemic load of the carbs you are eating.  What I mean by this is look at how fast your body converts this to sugar.  There are many tables you can download on the net.  \n\n2.  Omega 3 fatty acids will give your skin the most radical change in looks in as short as three days.  They do all kinds of things to your body that I don't have time to go into.  Yes, this works even if you have oily skin.  Sources of Omega 3's - Fish (Salmon is the best), Flaxseed, nuts, olive oil, avacado, etc.\n\n3.  Avoid Omega 6 fatty acids - you do need these but you want a decent ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3s.  Unfortunately in our society of McDonalds and Pizza, people have the ration backwards and get too much Omega 6's which causes stress on your body and then inflamation.  \n\nNot only will this strategy give you better looking skin but it will also lead to felling better and being healthy in general.  I recommend buying a coupld of books if this is a real problem for you."
"way to lose weight in less than a month....?
how can i lose about 10-18 pounds in one month???\n\nif possible....
It is posible but requires a little thought. As I dont know what your life style is I'll tell you how, then adapt it yourself.\nNo Alcohol at all.\nWalk at least 45 minutes every day at a good pace(dont kill yourself).\nCut your food intake down to 3 small meals per day with as little fat as possible.Plenty of breakfast, a medium size lunch and a small meal about6 o clock.\nNow, you are going to be hungry in between meals, Dont panic, eat pineapple,banana and other  fruit in between meals.Nuts are great too. (NOT PEANUTS).\nGet some light weights (5-20 lbs) and do 45 minutes every second day with a variation of repetitions.\nYou can do this. Just dont make it so hard that your body says NO THANKS. Good luck.I wish I could come and help you.Make sure that you eat, you need energy to do the work. Diets do not work.Remember , the fat wil disapear from all over the body not from one place. Remember also that the muscle you gain weighs more than the fat.If you dont see a weight reduction straight away dont panic it's muscle you are gaining.In two weeks you feel great. in four weeks you feel and look great.Then RETAIN that look.\n\nhttp://thebaldchemist.blogspot.com"

Front to back.  Just think, you don't want to be pulling poo/bacteria into your vagina and urethra (causing UTIs and other nasty infections).  As far as the ""pooting"" goes, that's normal, I believe teenagers  call it ""queefing""?  It happens because air goes up and gets trapped and then if you contract your stomach muscles at all then it comes out.  It happens a lot when condoms are in use because the latex provides an air tight seal and the man pushes already present air up the canal... (or at least that's when the BIG ones happen LOL)"

"doesa a non-malignant tumor still require chemo-therapy post removal surgery?

It depends upon the location and type of benign tumor that you mean. In general, probably not, but in rare cases chemotherapy may be indicated especially if there is a possiblity that the benign tumor will regrow. Very rare though, primarily because chemotherapy is a systemic treatment (treats the whole body) and benign tumors are generally localized (in one spot). Radiation may be considered as a possible treatment instead.\n\nChemotherapy for rare benign tumors may be indicated prior to surgery also. \n\n""PATIENTS WITH RARE PEDIATRIC KIDNEY TUMOR RESPOND TO CHEMOTHERAPY\n\nResearchers at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have found that chemotherapy is an effective treatment for a rare pediatric benign kidney tumor.  Called congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN), it is extremely rare and usually strikes infants in the first year of life.  For most patients, CMN can be cured with surgery to remove the kidney, but for some, the tumor may re-grow and spread to other organs."" \n\nThe only way to know for sure is to check with your physician (and, than you might want a second or third opinion to verify the recommendation)."
"Why they call hindus intolerant?
India has a Muslim president, A sikh prime minister and a catholic woman foreigner head of the national advisory council. In a country with 85% hindus that speaks tons about hindu tolerance.
Not that I was aware that anyone was calling Hindus intolerant (and I'm a Hindu so you'd think I would have heard that by now), I agree that your example does speak a lot about Hindu tolerance. Although, there is always news about some riot that occured and the Indian media like to make sure to state the religious beliefs of all those involved. Most of the time the riots or whatever bad has happened actually sparked over something nonreligious. I have, then, never understood the need to state the religions of all those involved in the skirmishes. I don't live in India so I really can't say much about all that happens there. I'm a Hindu living in the US and things are somewhat different here (Hindus are a minority, here, too). And I should state that not all Indian media states the religions of the people. I have read some that don't, but there seems to be some that almost go out of their way to report that insignificant information in the middle of their articles. So, if people are calling Hindus intolerant, maybe their reading those media sources. Otherwise, I've never been told that Hindus were intolerant and your example says a lot (and there are countless other examples, too, that I have read as well)."
"If a guys penis goes limp in the middle of sex, what could be the problem?
OK Good day everybody, i need some answers ok.  what could possible be the cause of a man's penis going dead right in the middle of a sexual intercouse.  he said that its not my fault, and he wont leave me so i really dont think its my fault, he always make excuses when it do happen like, he is tired, he got a contraction, he lost concentration, he remebered when i cheated on him ( and its not like he caught me in the act)  so please advise me if something could be wrong, could he be sick or something?
Sounds like he's trying to let you know what's going on...you're not listening.  If he's in good health overall (not overweight, smoker, etc) then it could be due to him holding out for you, preoccupied, stress, etc.  There are a lot of reasons why men lose an erection.  A lot of the time my b/f holds out for me and then when I'm good..he's good with that.  He's held out so long, it goes away.  He's usually ready to go again in 10 mins, though.  The fact that you cheated on him really doesn't help.  He may be picturing you doing some of the things you do with him, with someone else.  He's going to be questioning every new thing you do in bed.  ""New tricks?  New man?""  It's all about communication.  Let him know you're concerned and really LISTEN to his responses.  You two will work it out if it's meant to be.  He needs to truly forgive you for your mistake and move on if he wants to make it work...you'll need to bring his trust level back up.

"what is the dfference between the whole wheat and the whole grain? which one is better for health?

Whole grain can include other grains besides wheat.  So whole wheat is a subset of whole grains.  As to which is better for health, that would depend on what other grains were involved, as well as what other ingredients, not to mention the particulars of your own digestive system.\n\nEveryone knows about allergies, but people tend not to think about the fact that digestion is a very complex process that is different for different people, and even different for the same people under different conditions, and at different stages in their life.  (If I could eat the way I did when I was young . . .)  Saying one thing is healthier than another is very risky unless they are at extremes; something really very bad vs. something good for nearly everyone."
"Do you think we create what we fear most?
For example. If you're so afraid of losing your boyfriend and have so much fear for it...that you do stupid things to try to prevent it.  Eventually you lose them because you overdid your fear..
Try reading a bit on both Dependent Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder; along with Anxiety Disorders as these (the varied anxiety disorders) address irrational beliefs/fears.    Your question, based upon what you wrote afterwards, sounds less about ""creating fear"" and more about ""filling a void...a hole in our soul"" so to speak.  We need to learn to tackle our fears in ways that are not destructive to ourselves or others, facing them, journaling about them, talking to someone we trust and feel very safe with.  A direct answer to the question you posed, in my opinion, would be, ""Yes.  We can obsess over our fears of impending doom or losing someone, etc.  That obsession can then immobilize us with overwhelming fear and anxiety.""  Hope that helps."

"what is zinc?

Zinc is one of the most common elements in the earth's crust. Zinc is found in the air, soil, and water and is present in all foods. In its pure elemental (or metallic) form, zinc is a bluish-white shiny metal.\n\nThere is no information on the taste and odor of metallic zinc. Powdered zinc is explosive and may burst into flames if stored in damp places.\n\nMetallic zinc has many uses in industry. A common use is as coating for iron or other metals so that they do not rust or corrode. Metallic zinc is also mixed with other metals to form alloys such as brass and bronze. A zinc and copper alloy is used to make pennies in the United States. Metallic zinc is also used to make dry cell batteries.\n\nZinc can also combine with other elements, such as chlorine, oxygen, and sulfur, to form zinc compounds. Zinc compounds that may be found at hazardous waste sites are zinc chloride, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc sulfide. This profile focuses primarily on metallic zinc and commonly found or used zinc compounds.\n\n\nZinc Is Widely Used\nMost zinc ore found naturally in the environment is in the form of zinc sulfide. Zinc compounds are widely used in industry. Zinc compounds are not explosive or flammable. Zinc sulfide is gray-white or yellow-white, and zinc oxide is white.\n\nBoth of these compounds are used to make white paints, ceramics, and several other products. Zinc oxide is also used in producing rubber. Zinc compounds, such as zinc acetate, zinc chloride, and zinc sulfate, are used in preserving wood and in manufacturing and dyeing fabrics.\n\nZinc chloride is also the major ingredient in smoke from smoke bombs. Zinc compounds are also used by the drug industry as ingredients in some common products, such as sun blocks, diaper rash ointments, deodorants, athlete's foot preparations, acne and poison ivy preparations, and antidandruff shampoos.\n\nZinc is an essential food element needed by the body in small amounts. Too little zinc in the diet can lead to poor health, reproductive problems, and lowered ability to resist disease. Too much zinc can also be harmful to h"

"Who gets the credit for Christ's work on the Cross?
I have heard of a church that is teaching that they go to a place called purgatory to have their sins purged before they can get into God's heaven.  Their relatives have to pay money to the church at masses said for the dead and the more money that is collected, the faster they get out of this place and into heaven.  They also believe that their good works will get them to heaven.  If all of this is true then what did Jesus shed his blood for?  From what I understand in the Bible, just before Jesus died he said ""It is finished.""  So the glory goes to Him, and not anyone else.  He is the only one who gets a trophy!!!  P.S.  This church claims to be a Christian church.  Please help me to understand this.
Yes, you're right. Jesus death is the most important thing. And he did it - free of charge.  Which begs the question - why do people pay for it? Acts 15:11 ""But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.""  Just believe that he died to save you from your sins, and you will be saved - purgatory/masses etc are creations of man. They are nowhere found to be in the Bible - ""Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."""
"Judaism or Christianity or Isalm?
All are similar e.g the word ""AMEN"" or ""AMIN""\n\nADAM and EVE\n\nThe DEVIL or SATAN\n\nANGELS and HEAVENS and HELL\n\nand of course GOD\n\nComing out Moses then Jesus then Mohammad\n\n\nIn Torah its written about Moses and the prophets before him.\n\nIn Bible its written about Jesus, Moses and the prophets before him.\n\nIn Quran its written about Mohammad, Jesus, Moses and the prophets before him.\n\nChristians believe Judaism is the old version of God,s revelation.\n\nMuslims believe Christianity is the old version of God,s revelation.\n\nIf to compare the three books there is a lot of similarities but its obvious that they are not human made.\n\nDont you think its just repeating and repeating in the history.\n\nBut in Quran its written Islam is the last religion but the non believers will not believe any way in the same way - as the Jews did not believe in Christianity.\n\nMy job is to inform you - so which one is the right Religion?
First of all, I would like to thank everyone for their concern and questions on my religion.  It brings joy to me to see so many wanting to find the truth.\n\nThat said, there are some importnat notes we most consider.\n\n1. As Muslims we cannot lie about anything, especially about our religion.\n\n2. We have original recorded sources of our religion:\n\nA) The Quran\n\nB) Teachings of Muhammad.\n\nThis is a very unique part of Islam, not available in any other ancient religions.\n\n3. Sometimes ""questions"" contain misinformation. We must qualify what it is that someone is saying against what they are implying.\n\n4. If you find the answer to your question makes you say, ""I didn't know that"" or ""This is good"" are you ready to worship your God and your Lord without and partners?\n\nThis what Islam is really all about. The most important subject is the worship of Almighty God, without any partners or associates or ""gods"" besides Almighty God.\n\n\nYou speak of an arabic word when you do not know the language nor what the word means.\n\nNow, Islam is an arabic word. In order to understand what it means we must look at it in arabic rather than english.\n\nThe root word is s-l-m. Which has 5 distinct meanings:\nSurrender\nSubmission\nObey\nSincerity\nand Peace.\n\nSo you see, Islam is Surrendering and Submitting to the Will of Allah by obeying His Commandments in sincerity and peace.\n\nLike in English, the verb would be submitt, someone doing this would be a submitter. the er at the end makes it clear that it is an attribute to a person. In arabic, -mu is added but to the beginning of the word. For example, Islam would eb a Mu-islam, or just Muslim. Hajir, means to make pilgrammage, to miagrate, and so forth, a person would be called a muhajir. Once that is understood, then you can see that all ""Mu-Islam""s do is surrender, submit, obey Allah in sincerity and peace.\n\nNow, what is this ""Allah"" that I speak of? ""It makes no sense"" Well, like in english, you have God and god, Gods or goddess. In arabic, there is ilah, which means god, eliha, which means gods. Howeever, in arabic, it also means someone to be worshiped. Allah is The One and Only God, it cannot be made plural nor genderized. It is not lower case nor upper case. IT is clear. So, Allah is The One and Only God to be worshiped.\n\nNow, from the time of ADam to Muhammad peace be upon them all, there was only one thing being preached, Islam, which you can substitute for ""Surrendering, submitting, and obeying the Will of Allah(The One and Only God to be Worshiped) in sincerity and peace"" . They all preached this same thing, therfore making them Muslims. This means that What we have today as Islam was actually a way of life, a verb, that was followed by all the prophets of Allah Almighty.\n\nSo once you can understand this, we can see that It isnt Allah's Words that are constatnly changing it is Man's words. Allah keeps on sending the same messege. In arabic the word Man is Insaan which comes from the root word, Nasa(bear with my translations) which means to forget.\nSo what did Adam preach to his children and grandchildren and so forth? To Surrender, submit, obey the Will of the One and Only God to be worshiped in sincerity and peace. (peace be upon Adam)\nWhat did Noah peace be upon him preach to his people?the same thing.\nWhat did Moses peace be upon him preach to his people?the same thing.\nDavid?Soloman?Jacob?Ishmael?Isaac?Abraham?and all the rest?peace be upon them all.the same thing, they all preached the same thing.\n\nSo now, and I dont have time to continue all of this, What did Jesus peace be upon him preach? All the prophets preached that Islam(To Surrender, submit, obey the Will of the One and Only God to be worshiped in sincerity and peace.) was the correct and only way. So why would Jesus peace be upon him say otherwise?Why would he preach otherwise? Of course he didnt. "
"Every Group of Order 15 is Cyclic?
Ok, so I know a group G of order 15 must have normal subgroups of order 3 and 5 (by the sylow theorems).\nCan someone explain to me why this means the G is the internal direct product of these two groups and why this implies any such group is cyclic?\nPlease explain in full and clearly. Thanks
By the Sylow Theorems all of the three element subgroups are conjugates of each other, so for one of them to be normal there must only be one such subgroup.  Likewise for the subgroup of order five.\n\nIf we denote these two subgroups as { e, a, a^2 } and { e, b, b^2, b^3, b^4 } then we see that\n\n1 element { e } has order 1\n2 elements { a, a^2 } have order 3\n4 elements { b, b^2, b^3, b^4 } have order 5\n\nWhat is the order of the remaining 15 - (1 + 2 + 4) = 8 elements.  It is not 1, 3, nor 5 but it divides 15.  So every 15 element group has eight elements of order 15 and so is cyclic."

I have known Jay professionally for over 2 years and 7 months\nWhat was the nature of your relationship? \nAs Chief Manager of Client Servicing desk had daily interaction with Jay as he was my counterpart at ABC Life Insurance being the Chief Manager Underwriting. His ability to break down the most difficult of the insurance concepts for better understanding made him a “generalizing specialist” on the shop floor.\n\nPlease comment on the applicant’s academic attainments. \nHis academic brilliance can be understood from the way he was able to learn, improve and grow on the shop floor. Jay is the only underwriter ever to be sent from ABC Life to Old Mutual, South Africa and RGA South Africa, for training. He joined us in April 2003 as Manager Underwriting and within a year was re-designated to Senior Manager and the very next year promoted as Chief Manager Underwriting responsible for the underwriting function at ABC Life directly reporting into the Vice President Underwriting. His growth at ABC was unheard of and his ability to create and design software applications without any technical education helped him design ABC’s first automated underwriting solution.\nPlease comment on the applicant’s personal character. \nJay is a very easy to get along kind of individual. He always went out of his way to explain critical underwriting terms/ decisions to the Customer Support Executives. His fierce streak of loyalty to his team members made him popular in both senior management and his team. Coming from GE he was always immaculately particular about his interaction with employees of the opposite gender and was always held in high regard for his integrity.\n\nPlease indicate your overall evaluation of the applicant. \n√ Strongly recommended \nRecommend  \nRecommended with reservation \nNot recommended \n\nPlease make whatever additional comments you wish. \nJay Bean Chief Manager Underwriting ABC Life Insurance Company\nEmployee Performance  \n     Top 10%  Top 25%   Average Cannot Judge\nOrganization √   \nSoundness of Judgment√  \nVerbal Communication Ability√    \nWriting Ability          √  \nCompetence In Chosen Field√   Motivation to Succeed √ \nCreativity or Research Potential√\nWork Habits √   \nEmotional Stability √  Professional Behavior √  Interpersonal Relationships  √  \n\nJay is an innovative self-starter, who rarely needs supervision. He is punctual and typically exceeds expectations.  He handles pressure well, and will voluntarily work overtime to meet a deadline.  For example, we received a last minute approval from senior management to proceed with automation in underwriting, including critical user documentation.  Jay not only made the extremely tight deadline, but beat it; yet he still produced stellar, technically-accurate, standard product specifications.  New Business, Underwriting, Sales, train"

"how is the dip direction of a thrust fault indicated on a geologic map?

That other answer is confusing if not just wrong. I use polygons to represent my fault contacts on SUBSURFACE maps, but this cannot be done on a surface geology map, and the direction given is wrong. \n\nThe tick marks (triangular teeth or rectangular blocks) always point in the direction of the DIP OF THE FAULT PLANE. In a reverse fault this will be pointing towards the hanging wall, or the overriding thrust sheet, OPPOSITE the direction of its movement. \n\nIf you have a map with bar and ball symbols, these will always be on the downthrown block, whether normal or reverse. A bar and ball symbol is a small solid circle connected to the fault by a short line that is perpendicular to the fault trace. The letters U and D are sometimes put on a fault to show which side is upthrown and downthrown.\n\nTo see a clear illustration of this go to the last page of this document from the University of Southern California Structural Geology 305 class:\nhttp://earth.usc.edu/~edifilip/4.pdf\n\nOther references:\nDavis, G.H, and S.J Reynold,  1996, ""Structural Geology of Rocks and Regions"", 776 pp. \n\nhttp://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/303/303_Lab/GeolMapLab303.html"

It will also put a link on its Web site to accept Salvation Army donations.\n\n""We expect it to be successful. We don't know what to expect as far as the ultimate monetary gain,"" Temme said.

"Can you confuse me with your mathematical ramblings and equations?

The simple answer is i.  i is the variable representation of the square route of negative one.  Since a square route of a negative number is actually impossible, but it still needs to be represented by a symbol, then ""i"" is assigned.  ""i"" is appropriate as it is shorthand for imaginary number.\n\nThe long answer is try the...\n\nYang-Mills Existence And Mass Gap: Prove that for any compact simple gauge group G,\nquantum Yang-Mills theory on R4 exists and has a mass gap Δ > 0.\nAn important consequence of the existence of a mass gap is that for any positive constantC < Δ\nand for any local quantum field operator O such that Ω,OΩ\n = 0, one has\n|Ω,O(x)O(y)Ω\n| ≤ exp(−C|x − y|) , (2)\nas long as |x − y| is sufficiently large (depending on C and O). This gives a locality property that,\nroughly speaking, may make it possible to apply results on R4 to any four-manifold, as argued at a\nheuristic level (for a supersymmetric extension of four-dimensional gauge theory) in [40]. Thus, it\nmay be important in mathematical applications of four-dimensional quantum gauge theories.

"Why did people get all bent out of shape when Justin Timberlake pulled out Janets tit?
I mean it was ridiculous and Janet was the only one that took the heat for it when it was obvious  that the whole thing was staged and Justin knew what he was doing.  The event was put on by Viacom and MTV, the same company that was behind the MTV awards, the same MTV awards that Brittany passionatly kissed Madonna at and no one made a fuss seems to me Janet, the only black person in this group took the heat,prejudism what do you think?
That's exactly it! The whole thing was staged and people got their panties in a wad b/c ""It was a wardrobe malfunction"". PLEASE!! Wardrobe Malfunction my-----. It's also called, or what I like to call, ""Picked On Favorticism."" I'll agree with you that Janet took the heat for it, but Justin was the only one, that  I remember, that made a public apology for something that, what I feel, he AND Janet decided to do. I'm not saying she didn't  apologized for it, I just don't remember. I don't think it has to do with anyone being prejudice, I think somethings are just blown way out of proportion. That incident was totally staged and those two knew exactly what they were doing. As far as Brittany, she's from a small town in Louisiana and now she's this big time celebrity so she's getting all this attention now and sometimes I don't think she knows how to handle that. Brittany needs someone to give her some common sense though. Don't be suprised if she gets her children taken away from her. Haven't you noticed that everything is always a ""mistake"" now when concerning her son. She nearly fell on him coming out of a restaraunt b/c her shoe caught on her pants leg and another time, her nanny was getting him out of his high chair and he ended up falling. One other time, she was trying to get away from the Paparazzi and she didn't even have her son in his car seat. So is she as dumb as she looks or is she just trying to get more attention? I like Janet Jackson. I think she's talented and beautiful, but I also think some celebrities do things to get attention as if they already don't get enough."

"Why should anyone believe in a religion whos followers can't see eye to eye?
Once upon a time, there were nothing but Jews. Then, suddenly, there were Christians, Catholics, Mormons, Predestants, Jehovas Witnesses, Gnostics, Baptists, Methodists, Pennicostals.... the list goes on. There are virtually tens of churches in every city in the US, and although any member of any congregation would say that they are all basically the same, most of the time they won'd even acknowledge the other's claim of legitimacy. Though most of the time they tend to be very similay, often there would be radical differences between each sect. And, all the while, they all claim to be right and that all the others are wrong.\n\nSo, how can I put my faith in advice from a group of people that only seem to be able to agree with one another if it means proving some stupid atheist wrong, after which, they're mortal enemies again? Don't worry about me. I've been in the church for as long as I can remember. But what about all of the young ones being driven away every day by this bickering??

"My dad has Glaucoma, what can i do to help?
He has had it in his right eye for about 5 years, the eye is starting to protrude a bit, and he has almost no vision in it. He is an artist and he needs both eyes! Are there any good solutions out there, especially natural remedies?
Hi MakeEver\n\nHere is a testimonial and an idea on how to heal the issue.\n\nGlaucoma Disappears: I have a friend who had had eight major surgeries. She lived in constant pain, very seldom was she able to go places and her physician had told her their was nothing more they could do. \n\nShe went on Dr. Christopher's Three Day Cleanse and Mucusless Diet. She started on herbs to cleanse the colon,the blood Cayenne, Calc tea, Yucca AR, Herbal Eyebright, etc. In a matter of about three weeks, her pain was gone. She was able to start living again. In about 3 or 4 months her arthritis left her. \n\nShe had had glaucoma for 13 years. Her glaucoma medicine was making her ill, so she went to her eye specialist. He tested her and said there is not even a trace of glaucoma left. There is virtually no cure for glaucoma, how did you do it. Her reply was thru herbs and diet. She was told whatever it is, don't stop it. He took her off her glaucoma medication, and a special pair of glasses. She now tells me her eyes have improved so much that she can now watch TV without glasses, which she never before had done. She started on this program less than a year ago. Her dark brown eyes are now turning green. She has a ways yet to go, but she is really living again. She is a composer and this past holiday season, had a Christmas Album published. \n\n\nBest of health to both of you\n\nCheers"
"Does Laser Hair Removal Work?
How expensive is it?
Yes it does!! It worked wonders for me.  I had the procedure done 7 years ago when I was 21.  It does take between 3 to 6 procedures to see significant change in hair growth.  Thank God I only needed 3 sessions.  \nUsually the lighter your skin color is and the darker the hair the more success you will have and you wont have to take the 6 recommneded sessions. The reason for this is because the laser light goes after the dark hair easily. Also u need to get the treatment done every 6 to 8 weeks apart because of the hair growth pattern. Our body hair grows in different cycles in different parts and doing the procedure every 6 weeks guarantees that every section of follicles will be damaged. \nThe reason I had the procedure done which btw cost me $1200 each session for both my legs from my knee down was because I was as hairy as a guy and everytime i shaved or used Nair my skin will get extremely irritated. I cannot explain to you how much i hated summer because i was only able to shave once a week, the first day was ok to wear skirts and shorts but then by the end of the day i had to cover up for another 5 or 6 days until i was able to shave again.  Now, 7 years later i barely have any hair in my legs, yes i do get a stranded hair here and there but i can just shave it off easily or leave there for about a week or so becuase they are now very fine..   I also have to tell you that i had the procedure done in my underarms twice as well but i still have to shave, i have seen no difference there- perhaps because of the hair growth cycle and i only had 2 treatments.  I hope my answer helps you, I dont know the reasons why you want to get the hair laser removal procedure done but if you find the right Dr you will have great results.  Also, if you are like me and dont like to go through pain you should have the Doctor prescribe you a cream to numb the area to be treated.  My very first laser treatment only lasted a few minutes because i could not take the 'pain', it was a sensation as if a thousand rubber bands were hitting my skin, the doctor prescribed a cream that i applied 30 minutes before each procedure in his office.  I used to go 30 minutes before my scheduled appointment and i will undress, put on my cream, cover the legs with a plastic wrap and 30 minutes later i will unwrapp and procedure was done- lasted about 20 mintes."
"Which metal Na, or Li will react more vigorously with water?and Why?

Na will react more vigorously with water. Because Na is a bigger atom than Li, it's valence electron is farther away from the nucleus than Li's  valence electron is far away from it's nucleus. As a result, Na's valence electron is more loosely held in it's orbit, and so can escape more easily than Li's valence electron can escape."

...and please don't say ""it doesn't matter because....bla, bla, bla"", because all churches contradict all other churches in at least some ways, and they can't all be right.

"Should there be prayer in public schools?
Jesus said prayer should be a private affair devoid of public display: ""And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you they have received their reward.  But when you pray, go into your room (or closet.) and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret...""  (Matthew 6:5-6)
Absolutely not. \n\nLet me put it this way. Who's religious belief is right? \n\nIf you can answer that question, then we can have prayer in schools. If not, then you can begin to figure out why there is no prayer in school. \n\nSee, if the state begins to determine what prayers can be prayed in public school, then the state makes an endorsement of a particular religion. From there, the state gets more involved in the politics of religion. \n\nNow, the last thing you want is the government telling you how you should or shouldn't pray, right? \n\nLet me go a step further. Let's say we go with the fact that 90% of Americans believe in God. So, you say ""Hey, we can just pray to a generic god. Then nobody's discriminated against."" (Except the 10%, of course.)\n\nExcept, praying to a generic god is a sin. You pray to the one true god, otherwise, you're really ticking god off. Besides, Christians are pretty fond of Jesus and would get really ticked at keeping him out of prayers, don't you think?\n\nSo, we have to make a choice. Who's religion is the right one? Well, Christians outnumber everybody else by a wide margin in the US, guess we'll make Christiantiy the de facto religion of the US. (85% of believers are Christians of some form or another in the US. So we take 85% of the 90%)\n\nExcept, which version of Christianity is the right one? Do we have Catholic mass? Do we have have Baptismal hymnals? What about those who refuse to engage in the prayer? Will there be repercussions? (You bet there will be by those who do pray versus those who don't.)\n\nOK. You might say I'm complicating the problem, but I'm not. Essentially, we have a separation of church and state to avoid internal conflict in the country over who's religious belief is the correct one. We also, don't want a government telling us who to worship and how to worship. (Living in a religion dominated society is called, theocracy. See the Middle East for what our lives would be like if we had a church dominated government.)\n\nKeeping prayer out of schools and government allows us to live in a country where we have religious freedom. The freedom to worship as we choose of our own free will.\n\nIn other words nobody is penalized for not being of the ""correct"" faith. Everybody has the freedom to worship without government oversight and being bullied by social pressures. Nobody is at risk of the majority telling them how to live. \n\nAmerica is about freedom. Freedom from government endorsed religion is a good thing.\n\nHope that makes sense."

"so why is there carbonacious  shale  in  somer  meteorites?

Well, first I probably should know what a somer meteorite is, right? But you wanted answers, not more questions, right? Sorry, again. Okay, but be warned that a renowned physics professor at the University of Texas, a Dr. Steven Wienberg, I think (I hope!) it was, once reamarked about how remarkable it seems that our questions always honestly generate far more new questions than answers, so I'm not completely out of line, here, contrary to what may be quite conventionally viewed as popular opinion, especially in this context, i.e. an experimental situation, to wit; Yahoo! ANSWERS, a beta program.\nI believe Dr. Weinberg was involved somewhat in chaos theory, among other quite facinating things, I'm sure.\nIf memory serves me right, the term ""carbonaceous"" refers to, specifically, a geological era or period characteristic in reference to the more general use of the term as being rich in carbon, or consisting of carbon. Given carbon to be often associated with our familiar forms of DNA-based life, if it can be reasonably and plausibly demonstrated that any significant quantity or quality of carbon was introduced into the terrestrial environment via space, then this should prove to be interesting, at least, if not, indeed, rather provocative and even potentially quite instructive in terms of proper, universally themed deictic and didactic.\nSo, in my expert opinion, as the world's very first, ever, formal fact theorist, my best answer to your question is, ""Good Question!""\nKeep up the good work, and keep excellent track of your sources, even though they shall invariably change with ""progress"" and ""improvement"" such as that so far demonstrated by several millennia of so-so documented record. (Everyone, especially the Catholic Church, for example, wants to rewrite history. Even the noble scientists pursuing ""nothing but the truth"", and so on in their quest to convert followers to their newest, ""modern"" religion, in theory AND practice, have been known to tamper with data for personal ambition, just a bit too frequently for comfort, among other things...)"

"which alkaline earth metal has the least covalent character in its compound?

Berilium (Be) has.  This is because it's cation, which has a +2 charge, has its charge spread throughout a small volume (small size of Be2+).  Hence the charge density of Be2+ is very high and its polarising power is very high too.  So high, that it can snatch electrons from other atoms instead of sharing."
"Identical massless springs?
particle is attached between two identical massless springs on a horizontal frictionless table.  Both springs swivel freely at the fixed pins with no friction.  Wach spring has a natural length of L, a force constant k, and is unstressed when the particle is at the origin.  \n\nLooks like:         (The 1s are supposed to be the two springs)\n     .\n     1                            \n     1\n    @    \n     1\n     1\n     .\n\nIf the particle is constrained to move only along the x-axis, what is potential energy?  (we don't care about the constraint force that keeps y=0 at all times)\n\nThe x-direction is beside the @ (---x---)\n\nAlso, find the net force actoin on the particle for the case above.\n\nHelp with any part of this would be wonderful, I am so lost.
All you have to do is write an equation for the displacement of the springs as a function of x.  When the the particle is pulled to any x, the springs form 2 right triangles with the x and y axes:\n\n&#92;\n &#92;\n  @\n /\n/\n\nso lets call the length of the stretched springs h and define the displacement d = h-L:\nh^2 = x^2 + y^2\ny = L\nh^2 = x^2 + L^2\nh = sqrt(x^2 + L^2)\nd+L = sqrt(x^2 + L^2)\nd = sqrt(x^2 + L^2) - L\n\npotential in a spring is equal to 1/2 times the constant times the displacement squared.  So for one spring:\n\nPE = 0.5*k*d^2\nand for both springs, double it:\nPE = k*d^2\nPE = k*(sqrt(x^2 + L^2) - L)^2\n\nTo find the forces you have to do some more trig.  The total force of one spring equals k times the displacement.  In the y direction, you know that the net forces will always be 0 because the two springs cancel out.  In the x direction, the x components will be added.  x components are found be multiplying the magnitude times cos(theta) where theta is the angle formed. So:\n\nF_y = 0\nF_x = k*d*cos(theta) + k*d*cos(theta)\nF_x = 2*k*d*cos(theta)\nF_x = 2*k*(sqrt(x^2 + L^2) - L)*cos(theta)\n\ncos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse\ncos(theta) = x/h\ncos(theta) = x/(d+L)\ncos(theta) = x/(sqrt(x^2 + L^2) - L +L))\ncos(theta) = x/sqrt(x^2 + L^2)\n\nF_x = 2*k*(sqrt(x^2 + L^2) - L)*x/sqrt(x^2 + L^2)"
"How to dissolve Salicylic Acid in water?

Is this a chemistry question?  Generally speaking, you can increase the solubility of an acid by increasing the pH of the solution (adding a base).  It is also highly soluble in organic solvents given that benzene ring it's got.  Adding some alcohol to the solution should help.  The Merck Index (I've got a really old Tenth Edition) adds, ""[solubility] in water increased by sodium phosphate, borax, alkali acetates or citrates.""\n\nDepending on what you're doing, you probably only want to do one or the other (i.e., add a base or add an alcohol--don't do both).  General rule in experimentation: don't complicate things if you don't have to--the fewer variables the better."
"i havent had any symptoms of my period do you think is going to come? i had sex w/out a condom too?

I can't answer that without more information, but here are some things you should consider:\n\nDo you usually have regular periods?\nWhere were you in your cycle when you had sex (was it right after the last period, halfway in between, around the time your period was supposed to come)?\nDo you usually get PMS symptoms before your period?\nIs your period late yet, and if so, how late?\n\nIf you are worried about being pregnant, you could take a home pregnancy test.  It would be better to test than to be worried about it."
"differences between female frog and male frog?

I believe the female frog is bigger. You see males bigger than females is unique among mammals. There are ofcourse exceptions. But in insects, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians (such as a frog), it is the females that are generally larger. Also males will engage in most of the vocalizations to attract females. This is the ""ribit"" croaking a frog makes. Females will engage in a reciprocal call but only if they are in the area, it's usually the males or groups of males."
"Why would God want to make it blatantly obvious that He exists?
If we're put on this Earth to overcome life's many challenges (debt, addiction, bad luck in love, etc), couldn't lack of faith be one of those challenges?\n\nIf so, one must conclude that God wouldn't want to make it so obvious that He exists.
That is an interesting question dannythegr8, and you got me thinking.\n\nLet's start here...\nEphesians 2:8\nFor by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.\n\nJesus told the parable of the mustard seed, though it is the smallest of all seeds, if you have that much faith, you could move a mountain. So really, faith can be just a speck, but God will honor it. If you have zero faith, you will not pray at all. If you have a speck of faith, you can pray like the man who's son was possessed.\n\nMark 9:24\nImmediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!”\n\nAnd God will meet you where you are at."
"Spirits/Ghosts... Can they drip water on people?
If you check and know for a fact that you have NO leek in the roof and you've never had condensation in the room, is it possible for a Ghost or Spirit to drip water on someone as a way of communication with the living?
Yes.  Spirits imitate people.  Demonic spirits can do a lot of harm.  They can bring emotional agony.  Unless you have some powerful spiritual resources, I believe it is advisable not to dabble in the ghost/spirit realm.  They could take you somewhere you won't want to be later, though at first it seems appealing.  Go careful!"
"Could poor financial decision making be a sign of Bipolar disorder?
I have a close friend who seems to have made poor financial decisions.  He bought two new cars within a 4 month period, left his job to start his own business, but without ample finances to support the business, and unexplained mood swings.  One day he's completely depressed and worrying about things, and the next day he's on a high and talking about how he's going to be a millionaire and will own planes, boats, etc.
It sounds like bipolar to me. One KEY factor is staying awake without the need of drugs or medications. If this friend of yours stays awake on his own for long periods of time then I would check it out for sure. I am bipolar and I know that when I stay awake on these manic days, I tend to make planners, lists of things to do, lists of things to buy, goals that are completely unrealistic, I clean the house, I go shopping at 4am. Does any of that sound familiar? Another thing is that when the manic episode fades and I realize that I can't achieve the goals that I just set then I get depressed about it. www.crazymeds.org has lots of information so you might want to check that site, there should be a link to the forum site with even more information there."

"mathematician?
give me the matician's picture and thier contribution in mathematics
here is a pic of the greatest mathematician Leonhard Euler\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Leonhard_Euler.jpg\n\nwhat he did:\nLeonhard Euler (IPA /ˈɔɪlər/) (April 15, 1707 Basel, Switzerland - September 18, 1783 St Petersburg, Russia) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist. He is considered to be the dominant mathematician of the 18th century and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time; he is certainly among the most prolific, with collected works filling over 70 volumes.\n\nEuler developed many important concepts and proved numerous lasting theorems in diverse areas of mathematics, from calculus to number theory to topology. In the course of this work, he introduced much of modern mathematical terminology, defining the concept of a function, and its notation, such as sin, cos, and tan for the trigonometric functions.\n\nEuler's work touched upon so many fields that he is often the earliest written reference on a given matter. Physicists and mathematicians often jest that often times a discovery or theorem is named after the ""first person after Euler to discover it"". A list of his fundamental discoveries is bound to be incomplete -- he can be said to have founded elementary analysis, graph theory, and many of the physical applications of mathematics now fundamental to civil, mechanical, electrical and aeronautical engineering. So the following examples are just an incomplete sampling.\n\nEuler was the first to publish formulas with the constant e (also known as Euler's constant), and showed the usefulness, consistency, and simplicity of defining the exponent of an imaginary number by means of the Euler's formula\n\n \nwhich establishes the central role of the exponential function in elementary analysis, where virtually all functions are either variations of the exponential function or polynomials. This formula was called ""the most remarkable formula in mathematics"" by Richard Feynman (Lectures on Physics, p.I-22-10). Euler's identity is a special case of this\n\n \nEuler discovered quadratic reciprocity and proved that all even perfect numbers must be of Euclid's form. He investigated primitive roots, found new large primes, and deduced the infinitude of the primes from the divergence of the harmonic series. This was the first breakthrough in this area in 2000 years, heralding the birth of the analytic number theory. His work on factoring whole numbers over the complexes marked the beginning of the algebraic number theory. Amicable numbers had been known for 2000 years before Euler, and in all that time only 3 pairs were discovered. Euler found 59 more.\n\nWith Daniel Bernoulli, Euler developed the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation that allows the calculation of stress in beams. Euler also deduced the Euler equations, a set of laws of motion in fluid dynamics, formally identical to the Navier-Stokes equations, explaining, among other phenomena, the propagation of shock waves.\n\nLeonhard Euler:\n\nElaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and the gamma density functions. \nIntroduced a new method for solving 4th degree polynomials. \nProved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, and made distinct contributions to the Lagrange's four-square theorem. \nMade contributions to combinatorics, the calculus of variations and difference equations. \nCreated the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series and the analytic theory of continued fractions. \nSolved a multitude of diophantine equations. Introduced and studied the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. \nCalculated integrals with complex limits, which led (via Cauchy) to contour integration and complex analysis. \nDiscovered the addition theorem for elliptic integrals. \nInvented the calculus of variations, including its most well-known result, the Euler-Lagrange equation. \nProved the binomial theorem for binomials w"

Have you learned trig identities yet?  I'd check to see if there was a trig identity you could substitute here.\n\nBTW, I am assuming you meant cos²x rather than cosx².\n\nTry this:  cos²x + sin²x = 1, so substitute 1-sin²x for cos²x:\n\n6cos²x + sinx - 4 = 0\n\n6(1-sin²x) + sinx - 4 = 0\n\n-sin²x + sinx + 2 = 0\n\n(multiply by -1 to make it a little easier)\n\nsin²x - sinx - 2 = 0\n\n(sinx-2)(sinx+1) = 0\n\nSo, sinx = 2 or sinx = -1\n\nSolving for x, this means x = sin^-1(2) or sin^-1(-1)"

"were is a human stem cell located in the body?

Pluripotent stem cells are isolated from human embryos that are a few days old.

"What percentage of American women have, at one point or another in their lives, engaged in prostitution?
I'm looking for an answer to this to solve a social studies debate question.  Let's use a fairly standard definition for prostitution, e.g., a woman who has sex with a man in exchange for money.  Also, I'm looking for the percentage of women who have ever been prostitutes at one point or another in their lives, even if only for a limited time or even if only part-time (i.e., even if they only did it once or twice).  There seems to be a fair amount of data out there indicating the number of American men who have gone to prostitutes, but the percentage of Amercian women who have ever worked as prostitutes isn't readily available.  Thanks.
You're obviously having dificulty phrasing the question.  First you say: ""a woman who has sex with a man in exchange for money"".  Suppose she has sex for stocks and bonds, gold, or crack?  Why wouldn't she count?  Next you ""clarify"" and say: ""... include any sexual relationship which was initiated as an exchange of sex for money.""  Why does it matter how the relationship was initiated?  The answer is that almost ALL women engage in prostitution.  What percent of the women on first dates let the man pay for dinner?  I believe it's most.  What's the main thing women contribute to a marriage?  Sex.  What's the main thing a man contributes?  Money.  Families exist be cause a woman has sex with a man that pays the bills."
"What role does a person's reach play in generating velocity (i.e. when swinging a bat)?

A baseball players bat swing is parallel to centripetal acceleration.  It's defined as:\n\ncent._accel = v^2/r\n\nRearranging, you get r = v^2/[cent. accel].  Keeping centripetal acceleration constant, you can see that the radius and velocity are directly proportional (i.e. if r increases, v increases, and vice-versa).  \n\nThat is why that a person's reach affects generating velocity.  If his arms are longer, that resuls in a longer radius, causing velocity to increase from the above relationship.\n\n----------------\n\nHope this helps"

"Why do most living creatures have their anus at the back and between the legs?

First of all the premise of the question is not entirely correct.  Insects do not have their anus between their legs.\n\nMost animals are descended from worm-like animals.  A worm, in its simplest form is a tube with a mouth at one end, a gut and an anus at the other end.  It is more efficient to put the mouth at the front (direction of travel), so it evolved that mouth is in front, anus is in the rear.  Animals descended from that worm ancestor kept the same basic arrangement.  When animals developed legs the anus remained at the rear because the arrangement seems to work out pretty well."

"If my girl friend test negative for HIV, can I still have HIV as positive tessting result?
Me and my girl friend had many unprotected sex(almost everyday) since we met around 4 months ago. We pretty much did everything besides anall sex. She recently tested for HIV. We are still waiting for the result to come out. I am wondering if she has negative result for the test, does that mean I will probably be negative as well? Or is it possible still for me to have positive test result? what are the chances?  pretty worried, please help.
Yes, it's still possible that you could test positive.  And, it's also still possible that she could test positive in a later test if you are positive.  Seroconversion for HIV, the process of enough antibodies accumulating in the blood to allow for a reliable positive test result, can take six months.  So, if you already had it, and gave it to her somewhere over the past six months, she wouldn't necessarily test positive yet."

After being conned by a so-called friend in the mortgage business, I had to go bankrupt, in turn losing, two rental homes.  Now the home I live in had a 2/28 arm mortgage and it just so happens that the 2 yrs was up right at the time of my bankrupcty.  No one told me that after having two forclosures no my record, I wouldnt not be able to refinance.  Now my payment is up over 1500 a month when it originally started at around 900.  What I need to know is if it is possible to work with the lender to just give the house up, they have already made a looot of money off of me.  I know my credit is already trashed so that is no concern to me anymore.  I am moving out of state and need to get rid of all this headache.  Its been almost 3 and a half yrs that all this has been haunting me.  Thanks.     Dave
Call your lender. You may be able to make arrangements to do a ""Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure"". It's not done often, but given your circumstances, it may work for you. Also, talk to a real estate agent. There is a chance that you can sell this property for at least the amount that you owe on it, if not more. I'd actually suggest this over the other since you have a chance of actually getting back some of your investment. I really hope this works out for you. Good luck!"

"Can anyone define Love? lust and infatuation?

When I separate the person from who they are, i.e. a body part, that person has an incredible bottom, or they are hot, I am separating the person from who they are to how they appear/look. I am also idealizing who they are based on the objectification of their body, i.e., because that person is hot, I would like to get to know them, or somehow they are appealing emotionally mentally because they are hot. As I am objectifying, lust shows itself in fantasy. What would I like, what would I like to do with and to them. So I would say when the idealized picture of this person is replaced with reality, IE., who they really are. You can accept and be willing to see past faults, issues, problems because Love carries no jealousy, love doesn't judge, love don't do anything for self gratitude, love gives unconditionally, love is trust, love is respect, love is truth!"

"what kind of things did people do to get motivated to lose weight im having a hard time?

Motivation is a hard thing. I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of ""bad nasties"". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all"
"What is the 'true' definition of a soulmate?
I'd thought I'd met mine twice...yet been proved wrong. \nWhat does the term 'soulmate' mean to you...and why?
Someone's persona, just there being in the same room makes you happy, comphertable, and content. Someone who is everything you like, same foods Ideas of fun, moral values. \n\nTo me, a sole mate would offer Complete freedom in a relationship. With acceptance, and Commitment to each other being the most important values."

"what are signs of gullblatter problems?
ive been haven all kinds of pain in my chest and belly, and more heartburn then what i would have normaly... the pain got so bad i went to my doc... he told me it was just stress... that was three weeks ago.... now the pain is worse and everytime i eat or drink anything i feel sick and 30 to 60 mins later i have diarrhea... ive been doing this for two weeks and when i dont have diarrhea my stools are black... my mom and both of my grandmas and 3 of my aunts have had their gullblatters taken out because these problems.... what should i do ? my doc thinks iam crazy
Gallbaladder attacks are caused by allergies to high fat foods, quit drinking anything that has high sugar contents, soda, juice things like that, start drinking lots of water and your diet should probably change, I would eat plain food, like veges with no sauce or garnish, which means no butter too!!! just lightly steam veges for a couple of minutes, but not to long, also you could eat plain boneless skinless chicken breast. Just everything has to be very plain, no wheat, no sugar, basically no carbs, only veges and very lean protien. I had a gallbladder attack and they removed mine and I am only 27, after wards I did research and what I found out was very interesting, change your diet for a couple of weeks and see if that helps. I wish I would have known that, instead I had to lose a body part. I never had heartburn or issues before my attack, it just happened all of a sudden, but if you follow a low fat diet with no sugar you should be alot better in a couple of weeks.\n\nYour stool is weird because your gallbladder is not releasing enough enzymes to break down the fat in your foods, so if you reduce or cut completely your fat intake your gallbladder will be able to catch up( I guess that is how you can word it).\n\nPlease try this before you have gallbladder surgery, I wsih that I would have known about this before I had mine out. \n\nLet me know how it goes,\nLissa7903@yahoo.com\n\nMelissa"
"I have a question about this cut on my arm its deep..?
Dont ask how I got this cut but I have this cut on my arm which is bad its about 6 inches long 3 inches deep and 2 inches wide..I just want to know how long will it take till it heals? I have been putting bandiades on it and even after its been a day since I got it I took them off to replace them and its still bleeding..What do I do? And how long till it goes away? Will I have a scar?
I'm not going to ask you how you got your cut, because, you've already told me.  Anyways, the nurse in me needs to tell you that you should seek medical attention, for a couple of reasons.  The cut could get seriously infected, and you need someone to talk to about why you feel the need to hurt yourself, or the fact that someone else hurt you.\n\nAs for the cut itself.  It is extremely important that it stay clean. The edges of the cut need to stay together in order to heal.  If there are no stitches there will be a scar.  The continuous blood suggests a large deep wound.  If the surrounding skin is turning pink or red, and is warm to the touch  you must get help as this is  called cellulitis and can lead to blood poisoning.  This is when the wound gets infected and the bacteria enters the skin, and then the bloodstream.  This can be fatal.\n\nA cut this size and this deep really isn't something to hiding.  Please try to get someone to help you get some medical attention.\n\nI know that you are probably scared, but I'm sure that there is someone that you can trust.  If you are afraid that the ER will ask too many questions, then go to an urgent care center.  Come up with a plausible story, or another name for that matter. But for heavens sake, get someone to sew up the wound so you can heal the wound.  Good luck and God speed!"

"Dose Ice gather more bacterial in a hot container or in a colder one?
For my science fair i am doing a project and i need this answer for my background information PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!
Bacteria does not grow at freezing temperatures, but the temperature does not kill it. Heat  will kill bacteria if it is hot enough, but there is a range where bacteria like to grow. In food microbiology, we are told not to keep food between 40 and 140 F because that is where bacteria will grow.\nAs far as ice gathering bacteria, if it is open to the air, the temperature makes no difference."

"How can we buy a home?
My husband and I own our current home (making payments to the bank).  But we want to buy a new home.  I'm so confused- how does this work?  We can't afford to make two payments.  Do we sell our home first, then where will we live until we find a new one? Or should we look for a new home now?  We probably couldn't get another laon until this one is paid off.  Maybe a real estate agent could help?  But I feel really stupid.  Thanks!
It is very common to have this problem. \n\nYou have to put your house on the market and add a clause that the date of closing can be delayed until you find a new home. You might have to be reasonable here and put something like or until a certain date. (you can always get storage and live in a hotel until you find a place, or move in with family) A buyer won't want to be in limbo for a long time. If you accept an offer kick your search into high gear!\n\nWhen you buy a new house you put in the contract that it will close after you sell your other house. This is more common and you can have the time line a little longer depending on how easy it will be to sell your house and how far along you are. Hopefully you sell you other house first.\n\nYou may need to pay for both for a short period of time so you can move, but then the first payment usually is delayed a bit. You can talk to the lender about this to figure out the best time to close. It is usually the first of the month and then the payment isnt due until the 15th of the next month giving you 6 weeks without a payment. Arrangements can be made to change this date if you speak with your lender about it. \n\nHere is what you need to do. First get a real estate agent. Go with a referal of someone you know that highly recommends someone. Or if you have none, call around and have a meeting with a few. If you found one you really get along with well then you should work with them. If for some reason they just don't click with you then tell them you are going to make a decision after you meet with three and they are first. Don't let them pressure you into a decision.\n\nAfter you have a real estate agent talk with them about your concerns and they will explain everything you can do. The next thing you should do and can even do first if you want is to go to a mortgage broker or bank or credit union and get pre-qualified. This will let you know how much you can qualify for and the assumption is of course that you will pay off and sell the first house so don't even worry about that.\n\nGood Luck!"

I'm no stranger to this problem...\n\nIt feels like you are walking around in a fog, like nothing is truely ""real"" as you would normally feel it.  You feel like you could pass out at any second but at the same time you can force yourself to go on for quite a while without doing so.

Instantized protein is just protein that is made so that it can mixed easily with a spoon.\nOther proteins when mixed with a spoon may clump up or sink to the bottom of your cup. \n\ntheres nothing wrong with natural protein though and if you get a shaker cup and shake it up you most likely wont get any clumps.\n\nIf you want some good protein that is cheap go to http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/hp/whey.html\nthis stuff is good and you can get 10 pounds for around $50\nAlso bodybuilding.com can give you good info if you have any further questions.\n\nYou can email me at xxgremlinxwp@sbcglobal.net  if you need any more assistance id be glad to help."

In port injection or direct injection system the engine is started using either starter motor or by kick start. During kick start the engine may rotate in opposite direction at engine state cranking. Why it is happening?

"Black people are owed something!What are they owed?
money?Jobs?Freedom?we all ready have that!But Jobs and money something most of our race need is that.Money and Jobs!Who is the head of this world?White folks.So who should we get from?White folks.Now thats what most of our race needs,is money and jobs 300,000 people are out of work.Everyday we search for a job.People think that the people who are on the streets were dumb people.There are Billions of educated poor people on the street.We can't get a job or a descent job because people think were not good enough.Because half arn't good enough because they choose not to be.And most of the people arn't good enough.And we get judged because o f the slackers that are part of us.And they expect worst out of the ones who are good enough for a descent job.I have a word of advise and if you say im racist then who cares?I sure don't!Because if you do then some body needs to pull that pluton out of yo azz!Never work for the white man!!!Hello!
I can't help but wonder where everyone's sense is. I don't know about ""owed something,"" but if the majority of Americans truly believe that people of color are *not* discriminated against in our society, we are in a very sad state.\n\nRead the Constitution, people. The US Constitution and Bill of Rights is one of the most incredible documents ever written. One of its overall purposes was to establish a government that PROTECTED THE MINORITY FROM THE MAJORITY. Because in all times and all places, it is the minority that NEEDS protection.\n\nWhen I hear people say that Hispanics and blacks are lazy welfare bums, I want to scream. Do any of you truly believe that a mom chooses to live in a studio apartment with her kids with maybe $47 a month left over for clothes, soap. laundry, transportation, entertainment, school lunch, birthday gifts, furniture, dishes, pencils, toilet paper, shampoo, books and aluminum foil because she's trying to take advantage of you!? One minute's thought should dispel THAT belief. They do it because they stumbled into the situation, and can find no way out of it.\n\nNo, not all people of color are in that situation, but there are reasons that a higher percentage of the poor people in our country are minorities. It is because, in spite of what you say, they DO NOT have the same opportunities as the majority. Every day I read numerous posts here that begin, ""I am not a racist, but . . ."" and then they paint every black or brown American with the same lazy, stupid, criminal, drug addict brush. The people writing some of those posts are the people doing the hiring.\n\nAgain, in every society, the marginalized minority *is* the group that commits the most crimes per capita. Why? What the heck have they got to lose? \n\nCan you imagine what it's like being pulled over for ""driving while black?"" I can't. I am over 50, and I've been pulled over ONCE. Will Smith, one of the best-known, richest, and most respected African-Americans, said that he drives a fancy car and lives in a fancy neighborhood and gets pulled over about ONCE A MONTH. How do you think that kind of harassment might change your attitudes and behaviors? What might happen to your self-esteem if every time you walked into a store, the owner followed 20 steps behind you blatently staring at you?\n\nIf there's one science book between 5 students, aren't we all responsible for the kids' poor education? Should that mom above stop buying toilet paper to save up for six months for a $140 science book?\n\nEach individual must be held responsible for his own behavior. But to pretend that there's some kind of inborn propensity for evil among some groups is not only stupid, it's how societies fall.\n\nBTW, I am white. I am not currently on welfare, but have been. I am a single mom. I tend toward political conservatism, and I am ashamed of my countrymen's lack of understanding of simple social dynamics. Americans are ONE people with a beautiful tapestry of varied roots. The sooner we realize it, the better off this country will be. And if we don't, it will tear us apart at the seams. In fact, it already is.\n\nI don't know the answers. I know that things are a bit better than they were 50 years ago. But sometimes I wonder if it might not have been easier when words like ni**er and spi*k weren't politically incorrect. At least then people didn't start their rants with ""I am not a racist, but . . ."" The lines, at least, were clearer."
"Husband refuses to believe he has a health problem?
My husband just got diagnosed with epilepsy, when he found out he got extremely angry and refuses to believe so. Its A mild form of epilepsy which occurs during sleep. The doctor ran no test or anything before saying it was epilepsy and prescribing medication, although he does go for a CT scan next week. This is one of the issues that upset him, and he also thinks it may impact on his Job that he loves (however i doubnt it would due to the form of epilepsy it is) How do i help him to come to terms with this, or simply make him not rule out the fact that it is possibly epilepsy? Hubby is very, very adament its not and even quoted that ""its probably a brain tumour"", Why does he have such a stigma about  epilepsy?
Hello.\nFirst, when you say doctor, do you mean a GP or a specialist?\nSecond, as you said, doctor ran no test or anything before saying it was epilepsy. So no wonder your husband feels upset and rightly so!\n\nI think you should calm down and calm him down and tell him to wait for all the test and results. At the end it could be nothing or nothing serious. \n\nYou should consult and specialist/neurologist because he is the best person to evaluate your hubby's situation. He will ask you or/and your husband when it start,what was his reaction,for how long did it last (the fit) etc. Only after having all this(and maybe other) information and a scan result EEG,MRI that the neurologist can actually say if he suffers from epilepsy and what type of seizures is he having.\n\nIf it is actually epilepsy then his life will change. He might not be able to drive or work with machinery which could affect his work. The medication that he will be on will,somehow,also affect him due to the side effects. Read very carefully all the leaflets.\n\nYou said that the scan is next week. Why don't you do some research about epilepsy on the net?\n\nI find this website very good. It has peoples story,how did they cope with it and tons of information about it.\n\nhttp://www.epilepsy.com/"

"Do you judge fat people?

Well the fundamental problem with humans is they tend to analyse people from time to time. From that guy behind the McDonald Counter to our best pal or buddy. We are constantly watching them, observing their moves, actions and analysing what does it mean anyway. So, we judge people everytime without even knowing them. We judge by how they wear their clothes, what they wear, how they work, how they eat to the most nonsense ones like how they sneeze. With our limited knowledge and understanding of people we start thinking in a direction and gives reason for the actions such as ""Maybe he is lazy because, he is fat!"", ""His clothing is so sloppy, how can his work be good ?"". \nSo yes not only me but I think everyone I know of judge people before even trying to understand them (how are they are as humans beings? are our judgements right?). We never really make that effort, maybe thats the reason why there are so many human conflicts. \nBut at the positive side, whenever I have made an effort to understand the other person without prejudice I have always surprised myself, on how wrong I was in my previous judgements."

p.s : I have never done oral sex and also don't intend to.
Herpes and warts are two different viruses.

Perhaps this was more about depression over his career that got manifested and came out this way. He was just venting, I think. Unfortunately, he took it out on some black hecklers in the audience.

"Buying a house?
I am in the process of buying a house.What do you think is the best deal kind of a loan or mortgage.
That depends on your situation.  Fixed rate mortgages are preferred over ARMs, as your rate will not change.

Steer clear of interest only UNLESS you intend to pay extra toward your principal each month.   \n\nYou don't have to put 20% down to avoid PMI, and instead can get an 80/20 loan, just as the first person indicated in his answer.\n\nGood luck!"

Guess she didn't like that.  I hate females who have no sense of humor and act like big babies.  ""I'm telling.""  Seriously how many other people feel the same way?  It's so annoying.  That girl better not answer this question, I might take offense. :P
Peoples' silly ""sensitivities"" are so easily bruised.  \n\nBTW: Your answer about ""diving in"" was amusing!"
"i always hear homosexuality is a choice why do people think this anyways?
homosexuality is in a way a karma effect from past life to this one.\n\nis it a choice to be hetrasexual then if homosexual is a choice?\n\nit makes no sence to me why christians dont understand that being gay is inst a choice but a karma thing from past lives lived.\n\nexample of such life karma is ""a guy was a wife beater and hated women in his past life will become a women in the next life"" that is the truth of it christians and muslims and science even has proven this to be true that homosexuals where born that way
the attack on gays  has to do with wanting someone to demonize to attack because they are different. However anyone that attacks gays which is OT stuff should not have sideburns, should not eat ANY shellfish and follow ALL the OT laws. the same goes for those that love to demonize witches. the bible implies both karma and reincarnation but people whould rather not pay attention to any symbolic or deeper meanings instead make up thier own definition of it i.e. born again is now a sect of christianity and not a term for reincarnation.\n\nkarma is in the bible TWICE as you reap what you sow and an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.\n\nreincarnation is also in the bible as you must be born agian and I knew you before you were born. the thing is most christians whould rather excuse it to mean some brand of fundamentalist christianity.\n\nchristians that attack gays are either\n1) insecure with themselves\n2)having marital problems and want someone to blame\n3) too intellecually lazy to think about what they are doing\n4) have been bullied in the past and want an outlet to vent"
"What is best diet for 40 year old man who works out 3 hours per Day and can't seem to lose any weight?

I love Dr Phil for one reason and here it is\n\nHe continually asks his guests one simple question: ""How's it working for you?""\n\nSuccess in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.\n\nI am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.\n\nBefore I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. \n\nSo how does your body burn fat?\n\nThat process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.\n\nHow does your body release the fat from the cells?\n\nBefore you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.\n\n1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.\n2.Include small amounts of good fats.\n3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods\n4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.\n5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.\n\nThe most misunderstood weight loss strategy.\n\nReleasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.\n\nThe reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…\n\nYou need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. \nDoing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime \nsoon. Here is what you need to do:\n\n1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate\n2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...)\n\nThe world most efficient “fat burner” available in the market is FREE and is already available to you.\n\nBefore I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. \nWeight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. There is only one thing that actually burn body fat is you already have it. It does not come in a bottle or a special recipe. Body fat can only be burned"
"my arm hurts?
my arm as been hurting around the area of my elbow. i dont know why its hurt i couldnt have done anything to it. its been happening for a couple of weeks now. when i try to bend my arm i get a real sharp pain in my elbow, and i dont know why? i dont play sports and i didnt work out those weeks so i dont know what it could be.
You could have bumped it and forgotten.  I've done that.  Arthritis, bursitis could be a cause.  Could you have jambed or dislocated it?  Maybe you need a chiropractor to put it back in place.  Best thing that you can do is go to a doctor and have it checked out."
"Relatives in Ireland?

Hi :-) !

I am looking into independant contractor, I will make roughly $2625 for the remained of this year (its all I need).  Is that enough to have to be reported?  Or will I be wasting the IRS's valuable time?
Ugh, you need to file your taxes if you make more than $400 as an IC and I believe $700 as an employee. Not everyone has to file taxes.\n\nDON'T listen to ALMOST ALIVE. The IRS's site and other documents clearly state that independent contractors have to file if they make OVER $400. I'm sure he'll get caught soon. ALMOST ALIVE, aside from the taxes that you owe, just imagine how much in penalties you will have to pay-up to 25%. And, the IRS calculates interest on a daily compounded basis at a minimum of 7%. They have up to 10 years to collect for each tax year."

"whats holloween?
whats holloween today in comparison of holloweens history?
holloween today is alot different than it used to be. it started as a christian and catholic holiday. people would go from house to house to mourne the deaths that had occured to that family during that year. if the hosts denied them then they would trash the house. if they were accepted then they would ussually recieve soul cakes. those were a sweet little cake. over the years people would dress up and go to houses to ask for treats such as those. eventually it grew and now just children go from house to house ansking for treats like candy."
"Is there any research that shows that antibacterial soap kills more germs than regular soap?

as libby said, washing your hands is getting rid of bacteria through friction.  as for using waterless, antibacterial stuff, it kills every single microbe on your hands.  the thing is, you have billions of microbes all over you hands and body that actually work to kill the bad germs.  these are called your natural flora.  the bad germs are called transient microbes, these are the ones that cause disease.  if you kill your good germs, you have a much higher chance of getting sick, because those good germs aren't there to kill the bad ones.  best bet is to use plain old regular soap in a pump-dispener, not a bar (which can harbor bad germs)"
"can any one tell me just what a sand fire is ..ive heard this on the news that we have a sand fire,,,?

A sand fire is a type of major storm that occurs in Vulcan deserts. These storms advance at high speeds and are characterized by strong winds and blinding sand. The effects of a sand fire on the desert also generates dangerous lightning-like discharges of electrical energy close to the ground. Sand fire storms can last from hours to days."

"Workers comp in Oklajoma?
I am a Home Health nurse that requires me to drive approx 200 miles a day.  I was in between patient's homes when someone stopped suddenly in front of me and I rearended them.  I reported all to my boss as I should have.  I went ahead and worked the 4 days after the injury, with meds and mild to moderate pain.  Six days later the pain got worse, ESPECIALLY when I drove (most of my job time).  I couldn't drive but just a few minutes before I start getting tingling and a numbness up my left arm into my back and neck (sometimes my right arm also).  My boss took me off work the second week after the accident due to my increased problems.  Thing is, I return to the Dr in 2 days, I feel ok except for when I drive, use my arms a little too much, or sit for extended periods upright.  Im confused as to whether I should even attempt to return to work just yet or not.  I am not the type to blow off my job.  Haven't missed but 1 day of work in past 5 yrs, til now.  Any advice?
Given your background info, it is advisable for you to contact a lawyer who specializes in workers comp. You may have a case for getting some relief.\n\ncc"
"Where are the anti galaxies?

I suppose you are referring to galaxies composed entirely or at least mostly of antimatter. None have been observed. If there were any, it would certainly be coming into contact with large amounts of matter at some sort of boundary. At that point, the collisions of the two would set off gigantic amounts of gamma rays, which we would be able to see. These have not, however, been observed. This is likely due to the fact that, for some reason as yet unknown, the amount of matter has increased hugely in the universe relative to antimatter since the big bang."

"making dna models?
i have a DNA model project due tomarrow...and i have no clue how to even do it ... i have 12 balls painted and the laders are pipe cleaners i need to no what to use as the sugar molucles(5 sided) and how to turn it! please help:)
I don't know how much this will help you, but it might get you thinking. Use for different colors of straws (for example: red, green, blue, and yellow). Use each colored straw to represent each nitrogen base: adenine, thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. Then, since adenine and thymine always bond, cut them so that their ends, when paired up together, fit like a puzzle. Do the same for guanine and cytosine. You could run a pipe cleaner through the two pieces to connect them. Then on the outside, put a ball on either side of the nitrogen bases to stand for the sugar molecules. After that your piple cleaner should be strung like this: -----------O----[ A ][ T ]----O----------- Use the extra pipe cleaner on the outside and bend it upward. Then as you build more of these, you can wrap the outer pipe cleaners together to connect them all together. I hope that I was some help!"
"Why are Eastern Orthodox churches subdivided along national lines?
i.e. why is there a 'Russian Orthodox Church', 'greek Orthodox Church', 'Bulgarian Orthodox Church', etc. etc. etc.\n\nAre there any differences in beliefs or practices?
It has a little to do with religion, but more to do with politics.  The Greeks were the originators of Orthodox Catholicism.  The Russians adopted it later and everyone was happy for a while.  Then the Greeks declined and Russia ascended in power.  When Byzantium collapsed, the Russians essentially took over as leaders and protectors of the Orthodox religion.  Of course they made certain changes that the Greeks didn't agree with and you see your first big split.  All's cool again for a while until Russian Orthodoxy decides to make a few reforms.  Nothing major, but trying to correct some corrupted texts, slightly change a few traditions, that sort of thing.  Unfortunately, the Russian method of encouraging change has always been rather...forceful.  Whoever wouldn't change was excomunicated.  The big problem with this was that it seemed to say that all the people and saints who had gone before and practiced Orthodoxy by the old ways were irredeemably wrong.  Certain traditional Russians couldn't accept such this, and the second big split occurred.  Then you have Russia's imperial ambitions.  Russia thought of itself as the defender of the faith, with Moscow being like a '3rd Rome.' It wished to be a hegemon in Eastern Europe and used this religious mandate as justification.  The other countries would have been more or less willing to let Russia have it's way - it's nice having big friends, after all - except that as the best and the biggest, Russia expected these other countries to become like mini-Russias.  Russia thus tried to impose its language, government, religion, etc. on them.  Eventually these countries had enough and wanted to split.  Now keep in mind that religion at this time is inherently linked to power and to government.  To split from Russia but keep its religious leaders as the head of your religion is not to split from Russia at all.  So you end up seeing a lot of nationally divided splinter groups.  I'm not saying there aren't also legitimate theological differences, but they were probbly  initiated and exaggerated by political factors."
"Why do people always assume that people on welfare don't work?
I know several people that receive food stamps and believe me they work. It's just when you work 50 hours a week on minimum wage there still isn't enough money to buy food. After they pay rent, car insurance, health care, etc. they're broke and they have to eat. I don't know anyone on food stamps that doesn't work.
I work in welfare. 1/4 of the people honestly are in need, maybe they lost their job or they are a housewife whose husband left them with 4 kids and no job skills- they just need temporary help to get back on their feet. OR maybe they are working a minimum wage job and just cannot make ends meet- but those are few and far between<-- please believe. Another 2/4 are either elderly or disabled and cannot work. The last 1/4 ARE lazy bums that strive to have 10 kids just to increase their food stamp amount. (The lucky ones end up with over $2,000/month in child support so they don't have to work- chose your ""lays"" wisely, ladies). Then there are the single men who have 4 kids and won't work cause they don't want to pay child support (but who can blame them when child support takes more than half their checks when they do work). There are all kinds- not all fit neatly into a stereotype."
"What's the One Best Question to Ask a Job Seeking Candidate?

i think the most telling question will be a question that verifies the candidates qualifications for the job s/he is seeking.     so think of a situation that the potential employee might find him/herself in, and ask how they would handle that particular situation.    \n\nfor instance, you are interviewing a potential customer service manager.    tell the candidate that s/he has witnessed a staff member being rude to a customer.      What do you do?"
"If you expect the dollar to devalue, where is better to invest?
I think the dollar will decline in value, either slowly or dramtically. I do not want to specifically invest in foreign exchange.\n\nWith that in mind, where would be better to invest -\n1 A mutual fund with all its holding in foreign countries stock markets.\n2 A foreign company that is listed on the NYSE (and purchase it through there).\n3 Other... Does anyone have any other ideas?\n\nThanks!
Since when did a devalued Dollar make U.S. stocks a bad investment? Do they correlate? I don't think so. Almost all of the Dow 30 are international companies, along with thousands of others, and they will benefit as well.\n\nA weaker Dollar means we are more competive overseas. \n\nUnfortunately, I think the Dow has reached a top, but it has very little to do with the Dollar strength or weakness. \n\nYes, the foreign currencies have been in screaming uptrends since March, and this will probably continue.\n\nA mutual fund is a bad idea if the the stock market declines, since funds are always ""in"" the market. Have you noticed that world markets tend to trend together? The Nikeii was down 225 last Friday. A bad economy here means a bad economy everywhere. Investing overseas just complicates the matter, and solves nothing. \n\nIf you're a big institution with billions of dollars to invest, and you only need to beat other institutions by 1% or so to get a feather in your cap with the boss, then yeah, look overseas for other markets to put so much money to work and divest it. But for you as an individual to shift your focus overseas as your primary investment makes no sense, unless you know at least as much about that foreign market as you do our own. \n\nThere's two sides to every market. Short U.S. stocks if you think they are going down. \n\nWhy go to a foreign country where you know nothging about their gov't, their interest rates, their stability, their economy, their cultural preferences, etc?"
"Why do people put so much emphasis on beauty instead of looking at the person for who they are?

Unfortunately, it's a hold over from human evolution. We're hardwired to look for desirable mates, ones that ""appeal"" to us.

"Do you listen or wait for your turn to speak?
I listen.  It is an interesting question,  Think about it, dont just try to sound like a great person. Be honest when you answer!
I try to wait for my turn to speak. I was brought up to be patient and polite. But when I was in my late teens I realized that sometimes if I don't butt in no one would listen to me at all. Even if your polite and quiet you deserve to have your opinion heard."
"Changes in address require new W-9?

If you are expecting to receive Form 1099s from a company or companies, it would be in your best interest to complete new W-9 Forms to ensure that they have receipt of the address when they actually issue the 1099 forms.  Some companies may get this information from your billing address, but to ensure you get the 1099 timely, I would recommend changing the W-9 form to reflect the new address."

"What are the phases of Preclinical Testing?

In preclinical testing, the pharmaceutical company would be testing the compound for desired effect using an animal model.\n\nTake an antidepressant. They would have a potential chemical that they felt would be a good antidepressant. They would first tes it on rats to see if it had the predicted effect on the chemistry of the brain. Tis is step one of preclinical testing. To determine mechanism of action. Step 2 is dosage and toxicity. This is done to measure the effects on organ systems and look for side effects at high doses. \n\nOnce these are done, and the medication shows promise in animal models and has proven to be relatively safe in animal models then clinical testing may begin if the FDA approves it.\n\nIn clinical trials there are 3 phases:\n\nPhase I toxicity, i.e. checking if it hurts healthy people. Healthly volunteers take it or a placebo and report seide efects and they are closely monitored for problems.\n\nPhase II efficacy, i.e. if it does any good in patients with the condition. The target audience or population is given the medication or placebo to see if it truly works on them.\n\nPhase III long-term side-effects. In some medications this is shortened or skipped by the FDA. It should catch things liek the heart problems associated with celebrex, etc."

there trying to charge junk food and fast food restraints for there products. If you think this is a good idea. then think of this. the same people that want a fat tax want to legalize weed. what do you think.
California tried a ""junk food"" tax back in the 1980s.  It didn't last long. Nobody could really decide what was ""junk"" food.  Of course the junk food manufacturers helped confuse the issue with their PR firms working overtime clouding up the common sense opinions of what is and what is not junk.\n\nA fast food tax won't happen, and if it does, it won't last long."

"tenant selling drugs for a living?
the tenant is selling drugs and got arrested by undercover,two N5's have been served as well as an N6,selling narcotics, as well as an L2 was filed with tribunal, tenant is in jail as far as I know and has until the 12th of Nov. to move.  N6 was served in mailbox. I was wondering can I file a No Trespassing on him and allow him to get his belongings with a police officer?
Not only can you evict him to get him out of the apartment. But you can also ban him from the property so that he doesn't come back. You just have to serve him with a banned notice and send a copy to your local police department. If he still has personal items on your property then your local police department can escort him to get his belongings, then after that you shouldn't see him again, and if you do call the cops and have him arressted for trespassing. We have done this at the property i work at, and it works wonderfully."
"Biology Question?
Explain how the nitrogenous bases pair is essential for the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.\nAlso, Explain why the specific base pairing nature of DNA and RNA necleotides is essention for the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.
Well, nitrogenous base pairing and specific base pairing in DNA and RNA are basically the same thing.  The fact that the bases pair up equally and opposite allows for simple replication and transcription.  Basically, each individual strand serves as a template that can create its opposite, identical pair.  Thus, each single-strand of DNA can be used to replicate a new DNA strand or transcribe a ne RNA.  This is essential for translation because translation requires the appropriate RNAs.  If the nitrogenous bases did not pair up the way they do, with specific base pairings, replication and protein production would not be able to function the way it does and would require far more energy and result in a far greater number of harmful mutations."

"What's the obsession with sports?
Why are most men and some women so obsessed with sports? What makes a person a fan of a certain team and stay a fan for years even when most of the individual players in the team will have been changed over time? What are people applauding when they supporters of a team? For the most part, the only thing constant in a team is the colors and their logo. Is the logo what the fans support?
I'm not really into sports, myself. For some, it's probably just a competetive spirit. Pick a team, root for them. It gives one something to get excited about. In many cases, I also feel that some people (particularly those who get the craziest over sports) are pretty pathetic, and that the concept of ever being extremely proud of something they've done themselves is a lost cause. So they create a substitute, in a sports team, and attach their pride to it. It's ridiculous, but hey, they need something to be excited about, and it sure as hell isn't going to be anything in their lives."

"How can tell my mom to stop making me play stupid math games?

Tell your mom this story about my son and me.\n\nI played math games with my two sons constantly until my younger son was taking Algebra 2 in high school and started saying, ""I hate math."" \n\nI knew that he shouldn't hate math because he has a real talent for it. So I stopped bugging him with constant math problems (although I probably didn't cut it out entirely).\n\nAnyway, I held my breath to see whether he would start taking an interest in math and performing better. Fortunately, he got a more interesting math teacher the next year and stopped complaining about math.\n\nNow it's two years later, he's a senior in high school taking a second-semester college calculus course, and is planning to study engineering in college.\n\nConclusion: If you keep bugging the kid, he will dislike the subject. If you pull back some, and if he has some good teachers, he'll discover what he's good at and will want to do more of it."

"What do you think about Pluto not being a planet?
I think this is the dumbest thing EVER!! Pluto has been a planet for years and now they say it's not! It maybe smaller then the Moon, but still. It's just best to say it's a planet and not a ""drurf planet"" or whatever! We've lived with it has a planet and I think they sould keep it that way.
Redefining a planet as another type of solar system celestial body has occurred before. Don't think the scientists are nit-picking on Pluto. In the 1800's astronomers discovered a  celestial body(Ceres) between Mars & Jupiter, & initially named it as a planet. But other celestial bodies were discovered between Mars & Jupiter, & astronomers knew that the solar system had become more complex than they previously thought. Therefore, they renamed these previously named planets as asteroids. No one today thinks the asteroids between Mars & Jupiter should be planets. Since thousands of celestial bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune have been discovered(several really big ones), it seems logical to redefine Pluto as one of the trans-Neptunian objects or Kuiper belt objects to reflect our more complex understanding of our solar system. It happened in the 1800's to the Mars-Jupiter asteroids...it just happened in the 21st century for the Kuiper Belt objects. The reason that Pluto's planetary status was not reassigned before now was to honor Pluto's discoverer, Dr. Clyde Tombaugh. Pluto's discovery was truly amazing in the1930's. But Dr. Tombaugh's widow Patricia, age 93, reluctantly admitted that even Dr. Tombaugh would understand Pluto's reassignment."

"how can I cum more sperm?

Generally – when you ejaculate, you use a portion of the quantity of  available ejaculate that your body has produced up to that time.\n\nIf you want to ejaculate more on a regular basis, then you need to ejaculate more often, and your body will produce more ejaculate on a regular basis, because your body produces what it needs; this is sort of like keeping a larger supply on hand to meet a larger demand.  Our bodies are wonderfully adaptive that way.  It is sort of like working out – the more you lift, the more you are able to lift, and  the same is true for your ejaculate – the more you ejaculate, the more you will be able to.\n\nIf, for some reason, you just want to ejaculate a large quantity at one specific time, or over a short duration, then you can simply “save up” or not ejaculate for a period of days prior to the event where you wish to be able to provide a large quantity all at once.\n\nThis is why girls like myself, who really enjoy semen, and being coated, will often ask guys to not ejaculate for the few days before they plan on seeing us – we want them to save up a lot of semen for us."
"Muslim women and athletics?
I imagine there are many muslim women who are great athletes but because of restrictions on dress they have no hope of using the gift of athletics given to them by Allah. Is this fair?
That's a good question. Here's an interesting article highlighting one woman (er, the only woman) on the Iranian olympic team:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3570040.stm\n\nFor a strict muslim country, I think it's pretty progressive that they even allow this much. There are sporting competitions for women (at least in Iran) where they are allowed to dress in normal sports attire, but men are prohibited from attending these competitions, even as spectators or judges. Women in countries like this certainly don't have much hope of making advances on a worldwide scale in athletics.\n\nIs it fair? Of course not. Neither are the other long lists of rights denied to women by Islamic governments."

...Translation of Text:\n\nI am the Sorrow\nIn the Night,\nI am the Strength\nIn the Dream.\n\nI am the Voice\nOf Hope,\nI am the Shadow\nOf Death.\n\n...Notes and Informations:\n\nIt is of most interesting that, you are in possession of this text of which is written in a language that very few can understand, least to even know of its existence.  The language used in the text, which is actually a mystical poetry, is called ""Bearlairiamh"".\n\n""Bearlairiamh"" is not a dialect of Gaelic nor is it related to any of the Celtic tongues; however, its spelling-system was designed to appear as if it is Gaelic.  This language was invented (yes, it is an invented language) about seventy years-ago by a group of mystics and occultists in Ireland as their group's secretive tongue.\n\nAs the years gone-by, the supposed secret society ended (or so as it seems) and, the secretive language slowly lost its secretive roles.  It is not well-known for obvious reasons that, most of the public will not be bothered with a language invented by a society long forgotten.\n\nSince this language was used in an occult society, I would presume the book you acquired is actually a hand-written journal or record instead of some type-printed one.  By the way, the core of this language is a mixture of Gaelic, Hebrew, Greek and Latin."
"does anyone think genocide is a good thing?
if not please explain sodom and jericho-come donald lets reason together-no questions we have hitler again
No, of course genocide was not a good thing.  \n\nIt's erroneous to classify God's destruction of Sodom and Jericho as genocide.  \n\nIn both cases, the ""big picture"" is God's victory over evil on behalf of those who trust and believe in Him.  \n\nOne thing I've found helpful in reading the Bible is not only to focus on the event being described, but the deeper meaning behind the event and the lessons from it that can be applied today."
"What constitutes proficiency in Microsoft office for jobs?
hi, i keep seeing these newspaper adds that say you have to be proficient/advanced with Microsoft excell, word, etc. I'm currently studying a book from the library about Microsoft office..and there's quite alot but many things i'm sure would not be used in the work place.. so what should i learn?
Proficiency is usually displayed either by proven previous work experience, or passing certification tests. If you're lucky, the company might test you on-the-spot to see what you can do. Many temp agencies that specialize in office work will do this Spherion and AppleOne come to mind. Going to one of these and taking the test might be a good experience even if you aren't looking for ""temp"" work -- though many times in today's market temp really means temp-to-hire, because releasing a temp that doesn't work out is a lot cheaper than firing someone and then having to pay unemployment. Welcome to corporate America, right?\n\nAlso, you might want to check out Brainbench. Most of their certification tests are not free, but you can have a peek at the test outlines to see what topics are covered in a specific test."
"Do some people feel that if we didn't have religion we could be better people and we could accept each other?
Imagine there's no heaven\nIt's easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us only sky\nImagine all the people\nLiving for today...\n\nImagine there's no countries\nIt isn't hard to do\nNothing to kill or die for\nAnd no religion too\nImagine all the people\nLiving life in peace...\n(John Lennon)
No.  Morals developed out of religion.  Care and concern for human kind evolved from man's relationship with God.  While I realize it's a source of fanatical rampages, it's also a source of good in this world.  Without it, people would be a lot worse to one another."
"If mortgage interest rates rise sharply, say to 10%, what effect will that have on the value of real estate?
For example, if I purchased a house today for $100,000, at 6% interest, what could I sell the house for when mortgage interest rates hit 10%?
The intrest rate rising may cause property devaluation because fewer people will buy homes, and they will set on the market. Thats the only way I see that the % rate could effect values, but then again maybe a mortgage/realtor type will have a better answer."
"Theoretically speaking, if I was a white woman, dressed shabbily in dirty clothes, with natty hair and?
was sitting on the sidewalk asking for change, would you help me?\nWhat if I fit the same profile and I looked older, like in my 50's or 60's, would you help me then?
YES! I try to help anyone when ever it is feasible.I have been that homeless person many years ago, and if it wasn't for people's kindness and generosity, I could still very well be there today. It's karma to help people whenever it is in your power to do so."
"i need some good info on the element Krypton????   HELP ME !!!!!11?
WEB YOU AND OR ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!1111
Krypton \n Atomic Number:  36 \n Atomic Weight:  83.798 \n Melting Point:  115.79 K (-157.36°C or -251.25°F) \n Boiling Point:  119.93 K (-153.22°C or -243.80°F) \n Density:  0.003733 grams per cubic centimeters \n Phase at Room Temperature:  Gas \n Element Classification:  Non-metal \n Period Number:  4  Group Number:  18  Group Name:  Noble Gas \nFrom the Greek word for hidden, kryptos. \n Electron configuration  1s2        \n                                       2s2  2p6      \n                                       3s2  3p6  3d10    \n                                       4s2  4p6  \nKrypton was discovered on May 30, 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris M. Travers, an English chemist, while studying liquefied air. Small amounts of liquid krypton remained behind after the more volatile components of liquid air had boiled away. The earth's atmosphere is about 0.0001% krypton.\n\nThe high cost of obtaining krypton from the air has limited its practical applications. Krypton is used in some types of photographic flashes used in high speed photography. Some fluorescent light bulbs are filled with a mixture of krypton and argon gases. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a greenish-yellow light. In 1960, the length of the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red spectral line of krypton-86, an isotope of krypton.\n\nOnce thought to be completely inert, krypton is known to form a few compounds. Krypton difluoride (KrF2) is the easiest krypton compound to make and gram amounts of it have been produced."
"People that know the bible, please help to verify.  I overheard some one arguing with another about sin?
and prostitution.  He said that the bible states ...It is better to spill thy seed in the belly of a whore than it is to spill it on the ground. being that it is a sin for a man to allow his seed to spoil and not fetilize a womans egg to make a life. Is there really such a passage? I have not read the bible cover to cover but I have never seen or heard of such. Anyone know? or was he putting one over on everyone?
“it is better to spill your seed in the belly of a whore, than to spill it on the ground.” \n\nThat is NOT a Bibically quoted, rather It was a 19th century mis-interpretation of the story of Onan in Genesis that was commonly cited in the 19th and early 20th century: \n“And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up see to thy brother. And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. And the thing he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.”\n--The Bible, Genesis 38:8-10 \n\nNote: even the LDS/Mormons used this same application to interpret this act as something define in the Bible. That  fact is far from the truth. \n\n“But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.”- The Book of Mormon, Jacob 2:23\n\nAccording to Ancient Near Eastern culture, it would have been the responsibility of Onan to impregnate his dead brother's wife that his brother's line might continue. Selfishly, Onan did not wish any of his offspring to bear any name other than his own; and so while he did, in fact, take up the responsibility of sexual relations with his brother's wife, he would not ejaculate inside her but instead practiced the withdrawal method of birth control. God punished Onan for his wickedness and greed by putting him to death (and not, as is popularly believed, for masturbating). The rest of the narrative features the wife, Tamar, posing as a prostitute and seducing Onan's father, Judah. By him, she conceives and bears a son from whom Christ would descend. And God does not strike Judah or punish him in any way in the narrative.\nSo it appears that some cynic had taken the veneer of the tale and crafted a wry commentary that has come to be known as actual Scripture (unfortunately)."

"how do we know the shape of our solar system when we have not crossed it?

we know the shape of the solar system because we know from tracking the movement of planets that they orbit the sun, as they orbit the sun they must be going round it, so that is a slightly stretched oval shape. We can estimate where planets are (i.e. how far away they are) by using stars that we know are different distances away and measuring or by using the Hubble Telescope that can see all the way to Pluto and further and measure the distance."

"dose anyone know a summary of ""nature vs. nurture"" debate?

""nature vs. nurture"" is an attempt to categorize and explain human behaviour. ""Nature"" refers to intrinsic characteristics of a person or animal, whereas ""nurture"" suggests that such characteristics or behaviours are a product of the environment in which one was raised. One example is the debate over pit bulls. Many argue that the pit bull is a ""mean"" breed of dog -- that its ""nature"" is to be aggressive and to attack animals and people. Others say that the pit bull is actually a wonderful dog, sweet, and great with kids. Those people would be on the ""nurture"" side of the fence -- they say that pit bulls can be raised and trained to be attack dogs, but that their nature is the same as any other dog. Moat behaviour is probably a combination of nature and nurture, with inherent qualities (nature) and acquired traits (nurture) making up any person (or animal!)."
"i need to lose 1 stone quickhow can i do this and please dont be silly, no wood nymphs no hot pokers.?
i walk, ieat sensibly, i stopped smoking and put 2 stone on now i want to lose it I AM VERY DEPRESSED SO PLEASE DONT BE SILLY
Oh mate, my heart squeezed when I read your question.\nFirstly, well done with the smoking. It shows you have strength of character that you're going to need to regain your wardrobe. I know you're down now, but don't let this set you back. It's great that you're walking, but I think that whilst your metabolism is sulking you need a little more to kick-start it. You could try upping the pace by jogging some of your walking route, or try cycling or swimming. Substitute your drinks for hot or cold water with a slice of lemon and see if you can't try a wheat and dairy free diet for a couple of weeks.  I lost over a stone in less than a month doing this. Eating a lot of fresh fruit and veg lifted me out of my depression too. \nI hope things get better for you soon x"

"I have a lead 6 volt battery that went under water for about a hour and discharged can i get the charge back?

Unless they're rechargable batteries no.  If they are take into account if and what water they were exposed to.  Salt water corrodes things so if it came into contact with it just dispose of the batteries.  Battery acid is no fun and ruins clothes and burns like hell.  If it's fresh you have less chance of corrosion."
"what does the Seik religion believe?

Sikhism, the youngest of the world religions, is barely five hundred years old. Its founder, Guru Nanak, was born in 1469. Guru Nanak spread a simple message of ""Ek Ong Kar"": we are all one, created by the One Creator of all Creation. This was at a time when India was being torn apart by castes, sectarianism, religious factions, and fanaticism. He aligned with no religion, and respected all religions. He expressed the reality that there is one God and many paths, and the Name of God is Truth, ""Sat Nam"".   \n \n\nGuru Nanak's followers were Sikhs (seekers of truth). He taught them to bow only before God, and to link themselves to the Guru, the Light of Truth, who lives always in direct consciousness of God, experiencing no separation. Through words and example, the Guru demonstrates to followers how to experience God within themselves, bringing them from darkness into light. Guru Nanak was a humble bearer of this Light of Truth. He opposed superstition, injustice, and hypocrisy and inspired seekers by singing divine songs which touched the hearts of the most callous listeners. These songs were recorded, and formed the beginnings of the Sikhs' sacred writings, later to become the ""Siri Guru Granth Sahib"".\n\nGuru Nanak taught his way of life:\nNam Japa - To get up each day before sunrise, to clean the body, meditate on God’s Name and recite the Guru’s hymns to clean the mind. Throughout the day, continuously remember God’s Name with every breath.\nDharam di Kirat Karni - To work and earn by the sweat of the brow, to live a family way of life, and practice truthfulness and honesty in all dealings.\nVand Ke Chakna - To share the fruits of one’s labor with others before considering oneself. Thus, to live as an inspiration and a support to the entire community.\n\nThe Golden Chain\nThe foundation of Sikhism was laid down by Guru Nanak. Guru Nanak infused his own consciousness into a disciple, who then became Guru, subsequently passing the light on to the next, and so on. The word ""Guru"" is derived from the root words ""Gu"", which means darkness or ignorance, and ""Ru"", which means light or knowledge The Guru is the experience of Truth (God).\n\nEach one of the ten Gurus represents a divine attribute: \n\nGuru Nanak - Humility\nGuru Angad - Obedience\nGuru Amar Das — Equality\nGuru Ram Das - Service\nGuru Arjan - Self-Sacrifice\nGuru Hargobind - Justice\nGuru Har Rai - Mercy\nGuru Harkrishan - Purity\nGuru Tegh Bahadur - Tranquility\nGuru Gobind Singh - Royal Courage\nGuru Gobind Singh, the Tenth Guru, exemplified the Sikh ideal of the Soldier-Saint. He was also an inspired and prolific writer, courageous warrior, and a source of Divine Wisdom to his Sikhs. ""When all other means have failed,"" he said, ""only then is it righteous to take up the sword."" He was the defender of the poor, the meek, and the oppressed masses of India.\n\nThe Making of the Khalsa\nGuru Gobind Singh was the last Guru of the Sikhs in human form. He created the Khalsa, a spiritual brotherhood and sisterhood devoted to purity of thought and action. He gave the Khalsa a distinctive external form to remind them of their commitment, and to help them maintain an elevated state of consciousness. Every Sikh baptized as Khalsa vows to wear the Five ""K's"":\n\nKesh - uncut hair and beard, as given by God, to sustain him or her in higher consciousness; and a turban, the crown of spirituality.\n\nKangha - a wooden comb to properly groom the hair as a symbol of cleanliness.\n\nKatchera - specially made cotton underwear as a reminder of the commitment to purity.\n\nKara - a steel circle, worn on the wrist, signifying bondage to Truth and freedom from every other entanglement.\n\nKirpan - the sword, with which the Khalsa is committed to righteously defend the fine line of the Truth.\n\n\nKhalsa also vows to refrain from any sexual relationships outside of marriage, and"

Evening, all.\n\nI work as a volunteer mechanic with a cycling-promotion organisation called Pedal Power London  (our web site is at http://www.pedalpowerlondon.org/).

"What's the secret to preserving sea-shells in a dry area?
Is there anything I can do to preserve a sea shell as it appears to have spots arising from lack of sunlight on the underside only of the sea-shell. I would have a guess that light keeps the shell healthy as it can destroy some organisms.\n\nIs there any home remedy you can recommend to prolong the colour and brillance of a sea-shell out of the water?
Actually sunlight will bleach the seashell.  The colours in the seashell are given by accumulation of minerals and chromophores, and there's lots of things that can deteriorate them, thus leading to loss of coloration.  \n\nI'd suggest keeping it away from sunlight and strong sources of light.  Another very important thing is to wash it with neutral pH water (distilled water) because increased pH due to chemical decomposition and bacterial decomposition will also cause bleaching.  \n\nLast thing, and this I do for coral samples in my lab, spray the shell with artist's pastel colour fixative spray.  I use prismacolor brand."

"who invented telephone??!!?

Ask who really invented the telephone, and you may get the name of a German, Philipp Reis, not Alexander Graham Bell. \n\nReis was a 26-year-old science teacher when he began work on the telephone in 1860. His essential idea came from a paper by a French investigator named Bourseul. In 1854 Bourseul had explained how to transmit speech electrically. He wrote: \n\nSpeak against one diaphragm and let each vibration ""make or break"" the electric contact. The electric pulsations thereby produced will set the other diaphragm working, and [it then reproduces] the transmitted sound. \n\nConcept might be from Philipp Reis in 1860.\nAn invented telephone was from Alexander Graham Bell in 1876."

"How Do You Crossbreed a Plant?

This requires a serious answer. I will not disappoint you .I will give a satisfactory answer after finishing my busy schedule to day only. Kindly look out for the 'Edit' in the answer.\n\nEDIT-: Cross breeding between two plants is possible and it is being practiced for many centuries. \nIt is more commonly called ‘Hybridization’ . This is usually undertaken to improve the quality of the plant concerned from man’s point of view.\n \nAll commercially important crops and fruits / flowers are the results of hybridization.\nUsually hybridization is successful between the two plants of the same species. \nTo put it in simple language ; It is possible between two rose plants but between rose (Rosa ) and Hibiscus not possible.\n It is possible between two varieties of wheat (Triticum ) ; but between wheat and rice ( Oryza ) is not possible.\n It is possible between two varieties of mango (Mangifera) ; but between mango and  orange ( Citrus ) is not possible. \n \nFor hybridization the  pollen grain are collected from one plant ( It is the donor ) and carefully dusted on the mature stigma of the other plant.( It is the recipient ). Now the cross fertilization takes place between the gametes of the two plants in side the ovary / ovule of the recipient. Donor plant has no further role to perform. \n The seeds are collected from the recipient and allowed to germinate to find the expression of the  desired character / s.\n\n The process described above is too simple but  in reality it is not so . It will require understanding of many botanical / scientific terms so I have avoided it.\n It is due to the practice of hybridization we can still feed the teeming population of the world. \n \nGrafting is NOT crossbreeding."

"what specifically does emo mean? what does it stand for?

Comes from 'emotional', and refers to a musical genre that descended from punk. Emocore and what my friend calls 'screamo' are sub-genres. The term also refers to the youth culture that follows this music and its trappings.\n\nMusical genres are difficult to define, and it's nearly impossible to do so when the styles are still being developed. It's like writing a history book without any distance and the perspective it provides. For instance, the First World War was not called so until there was a second. 'Post-modernism', a philisophical movement, is identified by its proponents as a separate movement, but I think it will be identified as a blip in the decline of modernism.\n\nOh, yeah, for examples of the music try Dashboard Confessional, Brand New, and Fall Out Boy.

"How many jellybeans can you fit in a jar?
HOW MANY?
A lot depends upon how hungry you are when you start putting them in (in my case it is usually zero) :)\n\nIf it is a serious question and you can't afford to buy enough jellybeans to test it out, then buy a small bag, empty them into a small straight glass, so that the glass is full, and slowly pour some sugar into the glass until the gaps are filled up (gently tap the glass to make the sugar settle).\n\nEmpty all the jellybeans out and put the sugar back into the glass, measure how high the sugar is (ie. 1 inch) put the sugar back in the bag.\n\nNow fill the glass up with water, but less the height you measured (ie. 1 inch).... This gives you the volume of the jellybeens, now count the jellybeans and divide the volume by the number of jellybeans, you now have the volume of 1 jellybean.\n\nNow it is just a matter of finding out how big that jar you mentioned is and dividing it's volume by the volume of 1 jellybean.\n\nPresto you have the number of jelly beans in your jar :)\n\nPS. some jellybean manufacturers might have different sizes, try to find a typical sized bean :)"

If I understand you correctly, you're saying that your 17 year old friend has left ventricular hypertrophy and was advised to undergo surgery to correct this condition. The assumption, therefore, is that your friend has HOCM (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy). HOCM surgery probably involves open heart surgery, so it is relatively major surgery, unless your friend is able to undergo the non-surgical option where a small amount of alcohol is injected through a tube passed from the groin to reduce the bulk of the muscle that is blocking the flow of blood in the heart.

Scientists and dieticians have said again and again that the only perfectly healthy diet is eating small, balanced meals (all the food groups in correct proportions) at regular intervals.\n\nI know that some people fast as part of religious beliefs, personally I don't like the idea of any belief that encourages self-denial or self-punishment, but if you really feel you have to do it, then at least break the fast each morning or each night.\n\nIf you are fasting to lose weight, then you are wasting your time; crash diets like that just lead to you gaining weight in the long term."
"I have a disease....?
Its simptoms are cold hands and feet do to poor circulation. The only thing is, is that i can't remember what its called. Care to help?
As the other person said, Raynaud's\n\nThere are two types. One is an indication of an underlying disorder and the other isn't.\n\nYour body overreacts to the cold by shutting off circulation to your limbs. Of course the best thing to do is avoid problem areas from getting cold in the first place. If they do get cold you may have to resort to warm water to get the blood flowing again.\n\nI had a family member who suffered from this condition and would occasionally get terribly cold feet at night. For most people, this problem was solved by throwing another blanket on and the feet would warm up again because the  body no longer needed to conserve heat for the vital organs. But for my kin with Raynaud's this wasn't the case. The feet would remain cold and the only way to warm them was to go stand in a bathtub of warm water and move around in it a bit, then immediatly dry the feet and put slippers on until he got back to bed.\n\nSee what you learn by listening to your relatives' borning stories?"
"Christian standpoint :Why are we here?
From listening to Christians it seems that we are here to recognize Jesus was god and wait till the ""joy"" of Judgment day.  Is this it? And if so do you really think on any level this represents a loving god?
""We"" are not actually here. You're actually there. I know you're not here cos I've looked around and even shouted, but there's definately only me here. You're not hiding are you?"
"How long does it usually tax the IRS to follow up on a fraud complaint for a serial nonfiler?
If you report someone for failure to file 4 or 5 years of business an and personal taxes, how long does it usually take for them to contact that person?
There is no telling.  The referral has to be reviewed and a determination made whether or not to pursue the matter.  If it is pursued, the case is assigned to a manager, who in turn assigns it to an agent.  The agent then does a behind-the-scenes investigation regarding the person.  Finally, the person will be contacted (unless a decision was made somewhere along the line not to pursue the matter.).  Each of these steps can be delayed by workload, lack of personnel, etc.  There is no statute of limitations on an unfiled tax return, so there is generally no rush in these cases.\n\n**Regarding follow-up**\nSure it will eventually catch up with them.  The IRS can do up to six years' of tax returns within one audit when a nonfiler is involved, so by the time that the audit begins the person/business may be audited for five or six years at once."
"In chemistry, what is a tolerance?

When running an analytical technique, it may not always be possible to get the exact same result every time. So a standard is regularly run on instruments to make sure that they are still giving reliable results. The results from the standard vary, so the tolerance is the amount by which a datum is allowed to vary from the standard, before its existence becomes statistically improbable."

"How is interest rate calculated on a car ? Is it simple interest or compound ?

It is based on your APR (annual percentage rate). When your approved for financing, be sure to look at your APR.  Of course the higher the APR, the more interest you pay.  \n\nMost auto loans are simple interest loans.  On your contract it gives you the APR, finance charge (the dollar amount the credit will cost you), Amount Financed (the amount of credit provided to you) and the total sale price (this is the amount you will pay back after all the pymts are made)\n\nSimple interest is based on 30days of interest.  So the trick is, when you make pymts, NEVER go past your due date.  When you go past your due date, you pay extra interest.  This will affect your final pymt.  If you pay late all the time, your final pymt will not be your regular pymt.  It may be more.  Your loan was based on you making pymt every 30 days.  \n\nSome auto financing companies offer deferments or extentions when you fall behind (thats where they skip a pymt or two and move this pymt to the end of the contract)  If you take an extention, remember, that 30 day extention is accruing interest.  Which will change your final pymt at then of contract. \n\nI hope this helps."
"Knee pain.  MRI indicated a bone bruise and hairline.It's been popping a lot.Now I have bad pain behind knee?

Honestly, its better you consult a specialist / family MD to find out what's best for you. I really want to help but I don't think I can give better answers than specialist do. Sorry.\n\ngood luck\n\nLove is omnipresence, Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."
"My underarms and knees are darker than the rest of my body? What can I use to lighten them?

If you can afford to visit a dermatologist, that's your best bet.  If not, let me suggest the following:\n\nIt sounds as if your skin is reacting to the shaving of your underarms.  You might try waxing for them, if you can tolerate it.  (I've never had it done.)  If you are reluctant to try waxing, then you might use a chemical hair removal method for your underarms, like Nair.  Realize, however, that if your underarm skin is that sensitive, it might also react to the Nair.\n\nFor your knees, I'd recommend slathering some baby oil on them before you get into the shower or tub, allowing it to soften your knees, and then gentle buffing with a pumice stone.  It's not abnormal for elbows and knees to be a little darker than the surrounding skin.  Whatever you do, don't rub too hard with the pumice stone.  You'll abrade your skin.  Gentler is better.\n\nThere are over the counter gentle skin bleaching products that you can try for these two areas, as well.  Just don't over do it (like Michael Jackson)!  Lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent, as well.  (It will sting if you use it under your arms after shaving.)  Use sparingly.  Good luck."
"I have a 16-pin character LCD that I would like to connect to a solderless breadboard.  How can I do this?

Is there a robust, standard way of doing this?
Is there a row of pins on the back of the LCD display?  If not, you might be able to solder in a ""header"" which is a row of pins connected by plastic.  If you get the ones that are spaced 0.100"" apart, you can insert them into a solderless breadboard."

"What are your perceptions on Herbal remedies?

first, this world isn't all bad.  the FDA doesn't even regulate herbals, so how can they suppress them?  they should regulate them though since there are many non-reputable herbal companies that put out inneffective products, or their product has such variable potency you don't even know what you are getting.  there are good companies out there though.  i think some herbals are good, some are bad.  always be aware of drug interactions though, a popular herbal St. Johns wort is used commonly for depression, but it renders some medications useless (like statins for cholesterol like lipitor and zocor) and it can block the metabolism of other medications, so your body gets more than it needs.  always talk with a doctor and pharmacist before you start anything.  and any substance that you put into your body that is not there to begin with is called a ""drug"".  In other words, just because it is herbal doesn't mean it is good for you."
"What can cause quick changes in skin color (other than sun damage and smoking)?
just curious because one thing that happened to me was that since being a child up to 16 years old, I had skin that had a glowing appearance and tanned easily, then after that the skin became pale and dull and refused to tan easily without burning.  But when this change happened within a two years period, the skin never regained color or worsened. No one else in my family has experienced this, what can cause this? Vitamin deficiency? I never eat vegetables or fruit much, could that be what's causing it? If so, is it reversible? Will vitamin supplements help? How long would that take? What else could cause this to happen? I've read that tomatoes are ""the edible sunscreen"" and that if you consume a tomato for 6 months straight it will return some color to the skin, as well as halving the time it takes for the skin to be burned. But any feedback would be appreciated.
This could be something to do with Melanocytes\nMelanocytes produce pigment which are scattered through out the basal layer of the epedermis.  Melanocytes are derived from the never tissue and produce the pigment granules which are passed on to keratinocytes(epedermal cells that synthesize keratin)to give the skin the most of its color.  Your body is probably not producing Melanocytes go and see a doctor, this could be severe hope this helps"

"define removable prosthodontics.?
Dental Issues
Hello,\n\n      To keep it simple, a removable prosthondic appliance is a piece of dental work meant to replace missing teeth that can be placed and removed by the patient. They include complete or partial ""dentures"" and are opposed to fixed prosthondontics (which are bonded to the teeth, like veneers, crowns and bridges, and hence impossible to remove by the patient). With dental implants, both removable or fixed appliances are possible to make.\n\nI hope it answered well your question."
"What can you find in ""black holes"" in outer space?

Black holes do not give off any light, so they can't be seen directly.\n\nWhat we can see is the EFFECT of the black hole.  \n\nOne effect is caused by the fact that massive objects will bend light as it passes them - this is called ""Gravitational Lensing"".  \n\nAs a result, if we detect light from a distant star that is distorted in the specific pattern of gravitational lensing, we can deduce that there is a dark, massive object at the center of the distortion.\n\nAnother effect is produced when matter that is pulled into the black hole.  Once matter or light gets closer to a black hole than the critical distance (the ""event horizon"") it vanishes into the black hole and is never seen again.  But, matter NEAR the black hole that is falling into it will give off light or other radiation as it is destroyed by the black holes gravitational force.  This radiation includes bursts of X-rays, which we can detect.\n\nThe first black hole that was detected is called Cygnus X-1 (it is an X-ray source in the constellation of Cygnus, the swan)."
"I need information about History of pie and who discovered it.?
I have to make a presentation on it.
The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was only given the name pi in the last 300 years or so. The fact that it is a letter of the Greek alphabet should not mislead you into thinking that the Greeks were the first to use the concept.\n\nOften William Jones' book A New Introduction to Mathematics from 1706 is cited as the first text where the Greek letter π was used for this constant, but this notation became popular once Leonhard Euler adopted it some years later, \n\nThe ancient Babylonians used the fraction 355/113 (= 3.141592) (accurate to 6 decimal places) for pi, nearly 4,000 years ago, and I believe the Sumerians did before them. So it goes way back beyond the Greek civilisation."

Avoid diet gimmicks and don't look for a quick fix.  The answer is simple.  It starts with your sister.  Don't seek food to relieve stress.  Don't eat in front of the TV.  ALWAYS eat the right portion size.  ALWAYS look at food labels.  Don't drink sugar (no more soda, Gatorade, juice).  Avoid ENRICHED carbs (read the ingredients) and look for food that has at least 4 grams of fiber per serving.  And manage portions.  If you eat out, know that the portions that you get are usually 3 or 4 times the normal size.  Eat veggies and fruit a lot.  Eat SMALL meals 5 or 6 times a day--about 2 hours apart--and she'll never feel like she is hungry."

"I am being discriminated against for promotions because I am a man?
I work at a smoothie place and it seems like the girls there are taking over the place. All of the crewleaders are women except for one. I work my butt off and the owners love me, and everyone says I do a great job, yet I have seen four girls get promoted to crewleader over me. The lone male crewleader thinks I should get promoted, yet all the female ones say no. \n\nThis is some sort of power play and the guys are getting shafted. The owner is a male and apparently lets the crewleaders decide who gets promoted. According to the guy, the female crewleaders don't want guys to get promoted.\n\nWhy do women always pull this stunt? I've seen it happen so many times in different workplaces. I'm a very open-minded guy, but this has really shaped my opinion on women in the workplace. Let me tell you, it's not positive.

Talk with the owners about this. \n\nSay for instance, I have noticed several of the girls have been given a promotion for Smoothie Supervisor. Is there a reason WHY I haven't? What can I do to get the next Supervisors position? What qualifications do I need in order to get a Supervisors Position?"
"Should someone's actions be made basis for criticising a religion?
If You buy BMW car and hit someone walking on the road then what will u conclude? That BMW car is a killer. I don't think so. It is the driver who is at fault. In the same way actions of some muslims are associated with Islam? Though the english meaning of Islam is peace. There are some verses of Holy Quran which are quoted out of context. Those verses are not for killing innocent non muslims but it refers to those only who impose war on muslims and violate human rights. The Holy Quran says "" Killing a person is like killing to whole humanity"" The word in the verse is ""person"" not a muslim. So if someone kills an innocent christen it is killing whole humanity. When Holy Prophet conquered imposed wars on him, he would forgive all those who surrendered. Holy Quran staes "" Don't kill women, childern and old people in war"" Because they don't fight. If muslims are killing innocent non muslims it is heinous act and Islam condems it and there is no justification of it.
Of course not.  Wisdom includes tolerance for the things we don't understand or disagree with.  If someone judge's and entire religion, country, race, culture or gender based on the actions, it is stereotyping the entire group.\n\nI am a white, Christian woman.  If a few white, Christian women rob a bank, does that make all white Christian women bank robbers?  \n\nReligious fanatics of any denomination or belief comprise only a small percentage of the denomination as a whole and it is unfair to condemn everyone based on the actions of a few."
"Has anyone torn their ACL and had surgery?

I have torn my ACL snowboarding, it was not a lot of fun.

"How long after you file for bankruptcy is a good time to purchase a home?

The answer is, ""it depends.""\n\nWith some lenders, as long as your bankruptcy remains on your credit reports you will be denied credit.\n\nThe good news is, there are many ""normal"" lenders who are willing to work with you after bankruptcy. You just need to know where to find them.\n\nIt's NOT about working with lenders that are convenient for you. It's about finding lenders that will work with you without taking advantage of your situation.\n\nEach lender sets their own ""credit guidelines."" What are credit guidelines? They are simply the minimum requirements you must have in order to qualify for credit with that lender.\n\nThe three common credit guidelines for most lenders who work with people after bankruptcy are: \n(1) The amount of time you have since your discharge\n(2) How you pay your bills after discharge\n(3) Your FICO® credit scores.\n\nTime will heal.\n\nMortgage companies are pretty forgiving when it comes to lending money to someone who's filed bankruptcy. In fact, after bankruptcy, it's actually easier to get a mortgage on a new home than get approved for an unsecured credit card.\n\nAs long as your middle FICO credit score is 580 or above you will qualify for mortgage financing with no money down...just maybe not at the interest rate and terms you want. (This assumes you haven't had a foreclosure in the last 24 months and you have a good payment history since your discharge.)\n\nTo get better terms and a lower interest rate, you need a higher middle credit score. A middle score of 600 will give you a lower interest rate and better terms. (This assumes you haven't had a foreclosure in the last 12 months.) A middle score of 620 or above opens up even better options once you have two years after discharge."

"For what practical purposes is genetic engineering being developed?what makes it a controversial subject?
Do you have strong feeling about it?are you for or against?
Genetic engineering can help many disorders that result from genetic misorders and mutations.  The controversy surrounds the use of cloning to produce ""identical organisms"" where the clone's cells can be used to produce talor made tissue.  I do not believe cloning is necessary to get stem cells to carry out genetic engineering.  THere are sources in the body to retrieve stem cells.  The problem is obtaining cells that have not specialized.  The less specialized the easier to make the cell transform into a specific cell for tissue growth.  Also, all cells contian the same copy of DNA.  I think it is only a matter of time before engineeris can stimulate a cell into changing into another cell.  Other than that there is nothing really controversial about genetic engineering."

"Do you believe in evolution,and why?

There is an enormous amount of evidence supporting evolution, and none I have seen disputing it at all- There are gaps in the evidence, but there is no evidence directly *against* the theory.  Originally it was thought that evolution happened in a slow, steady, manner-but fossil evidence mounted that disputed that view, and thus the theory was refined, so that now we know it generally occurs more rapidly when there is major climactic change, leaving different environments, creating new ones, killing off of existing species which creates empty niches for new animals to fill.  Most arguments against evolution depend on areas where there is lack of evidence, not on evidence that disputes the theory.  \nThe first evidence was Darwin's observations that birds adapted genetically to different environments, a process that is, in fact, slow and steady.\nThen the geological and physical evidence that the Earth was actually billions, not thousands, of years old meant that there was plenty of time for evolution.\nThen the morphilogical evidence of relatedness.\nThis theory also explained the many vestigial structures found in animals, such as the tiny hipbones in snakes\nIt was well documented and accepted by the early 1900's-THis theory predicted that there would be a close correlation of genetic patterns with morphology, and predicted that there would be vestigial genes in animals.  It also predicted that all forms of life would share certain genes, and that closely related species would have closely related, but slightly different, genes.  All of these predictions were shown to be true.\nEvolution also predicted that structure such as wings would have evolved at some point with a different function, since evolutionary mutations that are beneficial (less than 1 in 100,000) would tend to make small changes, and one could not expect a lizard to bear baby lizards with full-blown wings.  THus, the structures that become wings would be expected to have had some other function, and eventually evolved into wings.  For many structures, such as wings and eyes, these early purposes have been determined.\nRapid evolution, especially under conditions of stress, is seen in bacteria and other one-celled animals.  Because the theory states that it would require thousands of generations to observe evolution in action, only bacteria and other very rapidly dividing organisms can be tested for evolutionary changes that we can actually see.\nThus, the theory effectively explains animal and plant diversity, the predictions that the theory made were shown to be true, the fossil, genetic, and morphological data from the past support the theory, and it has been demonstrated to occur in the only animals that it could be demonstrated in, bacteria.\nFor a theory about how things have occurred over the last few billion years, when we cannot actually ""see"" it occuring, when it has happened over a span of time far beyond our historical records, this is an overwhelming and nearly indisputable amount of evidence.\n\nThe theory does not predict that animals will become ""better"" over time, just that any genetic mutation which increase the viability and number of offspring will tend to change the species- Remember, the theory of evolution is only one of biochemistry, genetics, and environmental interactions- It is not a philosophy, religion, or value system- Evolution does not make value judgements, does not plan or think or even care- it is merely a physical process like a rock falling down a hill."

both positively and negative atoms have affinity for each other\n\nthis is due to the reason that each of them has few +ve particles \nand few -ive particles.this attract each other due their affinity\nbut both +ve and -ive atoms have protons(+ve particles) and electrons (-ive particles) in higher number therefore its always an over coming force this gives rise to an attraction or repelling force respectively on opposite and same type of charge"

"what is vortex tube?

The vortex tube, also known as the Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube, is a heat pump with no moving parts. Pressurized gas is injected into a specially designed chamber. The chamber's internal shape, combined with the pressure, accelerates the gas to a high rate of rotation (over 1,000,000 rpm). The gas is split into two streams, one giving kinetic energy to the other, and resulting in separate flows of hot and cold gases.\n\nThe vortex tube was invented in 1930 by French physicist Georges J. Ranque. German physicist Rudolf Hilsch improved the design and published a widely read paper in 1945 on the device, which he called a Wirbelröhre (literally, vortex tube)."

"its all about losing this weight right??
i started going to the gym this month June 12th.. i got for an hour each day, i do 30 min on the treadmill and 20 - 30 mins on the bike, but my weight has gone up since the first time i weighed myself there.. is that normal?? should i be going weight or losing weight.. i'm confused because as far as i am concerned people go to lose weight!! hmmm.. very interesting
Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)"
"upper abdominal movement?
my stomache feels like it has something moving across top \nof stomache can u plz tell me what it might be...
Peristaltic contractions, which are the normal intestinal muscle contractions you body uses to move food from the mouth to the anus.  Having a stomach ache could mean you have inflamed your stomach for some reason (bacteria, virus, intolerance), in which case your body is abnormally attuned to this spot.  If there was any swelling, the contractions might be visible, since the musclelies on top of and around the intestines and stomach.  I would recommend warm liquids (chicken broth or decaffeinated tea would be good) to soothe the stomach and decrease swelling."

"why is 13 considered unlucky?

Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13, a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture. While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times, the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage, having been first coined by Coriat (1911; Simpson and Weiner 1992). It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8, 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee. \n\nThis superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13. In particular, this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1, 2, ..., 11, 12, 14, 15, ... (Sloane's A011760; the ""elevator sequence""), omitting the number 13, in many high-rise American hotels, the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue, and so on. \n\nApparently, 13 hasn't always been considered unlucky. In fact, it appears that in ancient times, 13 was either considered in a positive light or (more commonly) not at all (Adams). The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus, although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times. \n\nThe association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars (such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles, while the solar Gregorian calendar  in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year. \n\nTriskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology, which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla, only to have his party crashed by Loki, the god of evil and turmoil, thus giving a total of 13 people. The legend goes on to related how Balder, one of the most beloved gods, tired to throw Loki out of the party, resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. \n\nFear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth  (a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia), despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century (""and on a Friday fell all this misfortune""), but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). In particular, it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture (beginning a journey, giving birth, getting married, moving, starting a new job, etc.) beginning around 1800 (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \n\nWhile 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper, the Crucifixion took place on a Friday, thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day. Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, on Friday, October 13, 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \n\nParaskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States, possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans. Interestingly, a study by Scanlon et al. (1993) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health, behavior, and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that, ""The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended."" \n\nWhile there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim, it has been suggested that $800 to $900 millio"

"What the heck is Emergency Medical Associates, i got a bill from them and know nothing, so what do i do now?

Are you responsible for this family member's bills?  If so, then you are responsible for this one.  If the name of the emergency facility was ""Emergency Medical Associates,"" then the emergency facility gets the money.  If ""Emergency Medical Associates"" is a medical group which runs the emergency room, then the medical group gets the money; and doctors' salaries, equipment upkeep, etc. are paid out of this income.\n\nIf you don't pay the EMA bill, it probably will be sent to collections; and you will be hearing from a bill-collecting company.\n\nYou may be able to call the emergency facility, explain your financial situation, and work out terms of payment.  The only financial assistance of which I know with respect to medical bills is Medicaid; and I believe you have to be on Medicaid at the time of medical service in order to be able to claim Medicaid as the insurer responsible for the bill."
"What is ""The Culture War""?

The culture war is relative new. It is a battle between the conservative and liberals. It started in the 60's but really6 caught fire in the 90's. Just as My fellow conservatives rally around the President to roll back and stop what happened under Clinton, the liberal want to add to their gains by electing more liberals. At one time there were four factions in the country as both parties had a liberal and a conservative wing. The Republican liberals were and are much smaller then the Democrat conservatives. Liberals used to be only concerned with economic issues, even most of them opposed abortion, gay rights, etc. The battle is hgetting worse as Tye liberals have managed to convince a higher share of the youth to buy their agenda. However as people get older they turn to become more conservative. except those who want leadership."

His temp might be low because taking too much severely depresses breathing, everythings slows down, and your body cools off, not to mention the fact that taking too much can put you into a coma so if you're smart you'll call 911, since you can't know for sure if he's just sleeping or in a drug induced coma, unless of course you have tried waking him and he doesn't respond.

ok, normally long term insurance has a elimnation period of 6 to 12 months before you get any payments.\n\nthe short term normally cover that first 6 months to a year.\n\nYou will need both to be fully covered.\n\nLets say you are in a car weck and can't work for 9 months,\nyou get no pay check, you can't pay your health insurance premuim  you lose your car and your house and so on.\n\nLets say you are in that same car wreck and can never work again, how will you live, pay your bills and so on.\n\nBut some people have enough money saved to pay all thier bills for that first year or first 6 months,  and can take the risk of not having short term,\n\nOthers can't afford the long term which costs alot more, so they buy the short term, to at least cover the more temp issues,"

I agree with the other respondent, you need to tackle the issue as to what causes you to use food to comfort yourself when you are emotional. There are groups like Overeaters Anonymous who can help you, or you could find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. As far as getting a handle on it - the second you realize you are in a situation where you're going to go for food in response to your emotions, whip out a notebook, write down what you are feeling & what brought on the need to feed. Remove yourself from the stress so you won't eat - & if you do eat before you stop & write the cause, write down what you ate, as well. A lot of sites recommend that you keep a journal of everything you eat each day so as to have a better idea WHY you're eating & WHAT you grab when the urge hits. It's not hard to fall into an emotional eating pattern - after all, what do we do for a good time? Get together with friends for a meal or snacks! What do we do at weddings, funerals, any family functions? We eat! When you get bored, munch a bag of chips in front of the tv. Go to a hockey game - get goodies at the breaks! It's so hard to avoid emotional eating.  But if you can work to identify what sets you off, you are really ahead in the game. So get a notebook & start writing. Good luck - hang in there, it can be done."
"I will retire in 15 years, I have not save very much for retiremet, what should I do?

Meet with a financial advisor.  You will have to do some hard-core saving.  The best bet is to have money taken right out of your paycheck, the more the better.  Your advisor will walk you through different investment options - mutual funds, annuities, stocks etc.  Mutual funds are great, they're several stocks of different risk levels all bundled together to minimize the risk while maximizing potential earnings.  If you could put $200 a month in for 15 years in a moderately aggressive mutual fund, you could easily end up with $50,000."
"Herniated Disk?
About 5 years ago i slipped and ruptured a disk in my lower back. \nI have had all the scans done and a surgeon told me that i will eventually have to have an operation but the time all depended on how long it took to deteriorate.\nI have had to change my job and i am in constant pain with sciatica.\n\nWho has been here before?\n\nWhat can i expect in the future?\n\nWhen i do have my op, what will it be like after?\n\nAny help please.
I have had the herniated disk. And from my experience and the best neuro surgeon in Arkansas according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. It will get worse it will come one day that you won't be able to get out of bed. That is due to the pressure it is putting on that main nerve. After a while the back pain doesn't bother you. It is the ability to work your legs. I couldn't drive because I wouldn't be able to hit the brake due to excessive pain.\nThe surgery is fast and simple it puts your disk back into place inside the vertebrae.  Right after surgery you will notice a lot of the pain is gone. It is great! And have little pain to work off. Once all is over your back will always have some kind of pain.\nAlso it will happen again 99% chances are good that it will be the same disk the one above it or below it. That is because this whole operation weaken those disks. I have had the surgery twice and mine was the same disk. \nHope this helps you\nTheedge62"

I hate being bone skinny I'm 110 now.  So I wanted other people's opinion on what's skinny but not too skinny or what's average and not fat.  Thanks!
130 lbs +/- 10%.  This means, based upon your height, your ideal body weight range is 117-143 pounds with 130 pounds the average wt for your height.  If you have a small bone frame then you are considered at healthy weight at the lower end of the range, medium bone frame--mid-range, large bone frame--higher weight range."
"I have a large knot under my arm what is it and how do u get rid of it?

Inside under the arm or outside? My comments below are in regards to inside and under the armpit.\n\nThen this  could swollen lymph nodes - which indicates that some process is going on in your body.  Normally those swellings disappear if the problem is temporary, like a sever flu. And then they are on both sides of the body and you notice the problems in general. \n\nNow - your knot is only under one arm, right? And it is not going away? You do not have an ongoing infection at your hand/nails/arm?  I do not want to make you overly concerned - but it could be a sign of a very serious issue. If I would be you I would have a doctor check it out. \n\nPlease note - all of that only refers to the assumption that the know is under the armpit and inside."

"Is my hipbone dislocated?
I ran before and this happened. But recently I raced someone, I beat 'em, but I hurt my hipbone. Did I dislocate it? I ran pretty fast, and I didn't stretch before. I know, I know, I shoul've stretched. But now I don't even know how to stretch that part out. Anybody got any help or advice? Thanks
You should not say dislocated. You would not be able to type this question.\nA dislocated hip means that the ball part of your leg has broken out of the hollow socket of the hip. There would be bone damage of the hip socket. You would be hurting."
"What sound does a giraffe make?

I worked at a zoo for nine years and witnessed the birth of two calves.  In that time I never heard any make a sound.  I don't think they are mute but animals are known to be able to make sounds beyond our range of hearing.  Elephants for example can make sounds that can be heard only by elephants and communicate for many miles."

"Five states?
On a map I noticed there's a fairly small area at the west end of the Oklahoma panhandle where five states -- Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico -- are all pretty close to each other.

How about where Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas get close?"

"Could the Apostle Paul have been gay?
He always spoke of his ""thorn in the flesh', a physical problem or temptation he couldn't seem to shake. The fundies say he had a gimp arm or whatever. I say that's lame. You know, he never married and he spoke out against marriage. I think there's a good chance here.
I know quite a few gay christians and they all identify with the apostle Paul. Gay Christians totally empathise with Paul because:\n\n(1) Read Romans 7:15 to 25. Paul says tries and tries but still cannot help but sin. You could sense his frustration in these verses. He called himself a 'Wretched and miserable man"" because of this struggle of his.\n\n(2) He also grew disheartened when after asking God so many times to remove the “thorn” in his side, God would not do it. This symbolic “thorn” has come to symbolise for gay people, their homosexual orientation. Many gay Christians have asked God in tears and total depth of despair to remove their homosexuality, their “thorn” and just like Paul, God would not do it\n\n(3) The Reason God gave Paul for not removing his ""thorn"" was, 2 Corinthians 12:9 “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” God actually says that the imperfect “thorn” or weakness would actually make Paul a better, stronger person. And most gay people find that once they accept God’s answer and just let go of the self hatred they CAN be better, stronger people. \n\nAnd I admire them because unlike MANY CHristians, they have had a REAL test of faith. If after deep soul searching and intense commune with their Creator, in addition to therapy, spiritual counselling and inflicting and all kinds of emotional and mental scars upon themselves through efforts to change, a gay person finds he or she cannot change they will simply arrive at an ultimatum. \n\nThey can either accept, (A) “This is God’s will for me.” and stop beating up themselves and try to make the best of the cards they were dealt or (B)‘There is no God and bible is bull-crap” and try to be happy and fulfilled as an atheist or non-Christian. \n\nIt’s one heck of a test of faith and beliefs. Something most take for granted and many have gay people STILL have to endure all kinds of persecution and condemnation from hateful, judgemental Christians and yet they STILL choose to stick with their faith. I have found most gay Christians, because of their struggle are MORE humble, more empathetic, compassionate and a lot less judgemental of other people."
"Do people say things they wouldn't normally say when their drunk or buzzed?
I had just broke up with someone I dated for a long time.  I went out with a bunch of people from work a week later.  Some guys and some girls.  I was feeling really down on myself and crying.  This one guy from work, that had recently quit.  He said he always thought I was gorgeous.  And when he'd see me at work he thought I was so hot.  He's engaged, but he did sometimes flirt at work.  A couple of the girls said I was pretty and a stranger in the bathroom said oh she's so pretty.  Do you think these people were just trying to make me feel better?  Especially the one guy that used to work with me.  Would a stranger just say this for the hell of it?
I dont see why a stranger would say it at all. Your an adult I assume? Adults don't generally walk around saying 'oh isnt she pretty' except in reference to babies and young children. Truth is, I think maybe its what you want to hear cause your feeling insecure over the breakup.  Life goes on and you'll meet other guys."
"How about sending bibles to starving folks in Africa?
I saw a news clips the other night about a bunch of folks starvin somewhere in Africa or someplace like that. Apprantely in this God forsaken place there has been a drought for decades.  \nAnd I asked myself, why doesn't the Lord just make it rain or send those poor wretches some manna? Then THE SPIRIT came upon me and I realized, it must be because they are heathens. And THE SPIRIT blessed me with the thought--what if we gave all those starvin heathins their own KJV BIBLE so they could read it and get RIGHT with God. \nTHEN God would bless them and take care of them and make the rains come, and send them manna from Heaven. \nIsn't that a great idea? PRAISE THE LORD!!
PRAISE THE LORD is right brother.  Send those heathens stacks of bibles, so they can learn the true word of god and learn how to appreciate what the lord has given them.  A chance to serve god a chance to donate to the Christian Coalition and a chance to join the Promise Keepers.\n\nGod will make it rain if these heathens can learn how to pray.\n\nGod bless man"

"What does electrolysis of saltwater make?

If ""salt"" is Sodium Chloride, then you will be making Hydrogen gas (H2) and (Oxygen gas (O2) and/or Chlorine gas (Cl2)).\n\nUnless you plan on very carefully controlling the potential difference across your electrolytic cell to use just the bare minimum voltage, you are likely to make Chlorine gas at the anode instead of Oxygen.\nOxygen gas has a reduction potential of 1.23 volts, where are Chlorine gas has a reduction potential of 1.36 volts.\nThis means that if you supply just a tiny bit of extra voltage across the cell, instead of just producing Oxygen gas from the water, you will be oxidizing the Chloride ions in solution to make Chlorine gas."

If it's a proof, or in mint condition, or is a ""mistake"" (ie, double-struck, half-struck, etc) then it would be valuable.  If its a regular circulated coin its only going to be worth face value.  To be sure, try taking it to a coin collector/dealer and asking them to tell you what its worth.  Or find a pricing guide in your local library (the official pricing guide is called a red book)."

"is it true that u can lose weight by using the bathroom?
is it true that you can lose weight by defecating (i'm not talking about taking laxatives to induce defecation). i'm talking about every day, normal number 2's.
Yup. Your body hold onto about 5-8 lbs. worth of digested food in your intestine. If you were to stop eating it would take about 2-3 days to empty it out, hence losing about 5-8 pounds. But of course, next meal it will creep back."
"Do you believe in the Illuminati?

"Selling my chip dip recipe?How?
could i manufacture myself? could i sell it to a bigger companie?
You could do both.  Frankly I'd be amazed if they just bought the recipe.  Very often home recipes don't translate into large production facilities.

That way you could work out any production problems."
"Why are there stars in the sky?
how are stars created and why are they in the sky?
Stars are big fiery balls of gas. Essentially the gases cluster together and become stars through gravity and fusion. It's a rather complicated process; check the link below for a more detailed explanation.\n\nStars appear to be in our sky because they are in space. Most stars appear to be small points of light, although many of these stars are smaller than our sun. The sun simply appears larger because it is much nearer to the Earth."

"What is capitol of India?

New Delhi (Hindi: नई दिल्ली, Punjabi: ਨਵੀਂ ਦਿੱਲੀ), an urban area within the metropolis of Delhi, is the seat of the Government of India. It is one of the three municipal corporations of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.\n\nCalcutta was the historic centre of the British presence in India, and effectively the capital of the British East India Company. However, Delhi had been the historic capital of much of the subcontinent for long historic periods. In particular, it had been the most recent capital of the Mughals. There remained an association with Imperial grandeur that the British Raj tried to use by holding several durbars for the Viceroy and visiting Royalty. In 1911, at the King-Emperor George V's Coronation Durbar, the announcement was made that the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.\n\nNew Delhi was laid out to the south of the older city constructed by Shah Jahan, which is now often referred to as Old Delhi. However, New Delhi overlays many of the previous cities constructed there; hence it includes many monuments of previous cities, and constructions.\n\nMuch of New Delhi was planned by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who laid out a grandiose central administrative area as a testament to British imperial pretensions. Rajpath - then Kingsway - stretched from the War Memorial - now India Gate to the Viceroy's House - Rashtrapati Bhavan atop Raisina Hill. In its scale, extravagance and magnificence, it was not unlike Washington, or Haussmann and his patron Napoleon III's Paris, both cities designed to awe the newcomer with the power of the central State. Tucked away are other clues to the worldview of the designers; Herbert Baker's Parliament House is barely visible from Rajpath, as deliberative democracy was not a central part of Britain's plans for India; in fact, the main entrance to the Central Secretariat North Block declares ""Liberty will not descend to a people; a people must raise themselves to liberty. It is a blessing which must be earned before it can be enjoyed"""

"how is working in Uzbekistan? Should I go there for work?
I wonder how is the life standart in Uzbekistan?
It might be an interesting experience for couple of months, but i wouldn't recommend it for longer periods of time... too many issues in this country right now, and if you really just want to get some international work experience, there are places out there that you'll enjoy more.\n\nthe culture is rich, people are friendly, but most of the population is very poor, especially in the rural areas. IF you're planning to work in Tashkent, you'll be fine. The city has OK living standards with all the supermarkets, restaurants, clubs, hospitals, and other infrastructure, but rural areas are still very underdeveloped. Water can be a huge issue in some villages, toilet facilities (in rural areas it's often outside the house and boils down to a simple hole in a ground), electricity and gas shortages are a norm (again i'm talking about rural areas). \n\nI'd think twice before going there... I was born and grew up there until the certain age and still go there every year to visit, so i'm used to how things work there, but for the foreigners it can be a tough place. I had Peace Corp friends from the US who lived and worked in Tashkent and said it was OK, but the few that lived in rural areas, while appreciating the people and culture, said the conditions were pretty rough."

Make a long long story short. i had a baby by this guy, it was a one night thing. we were just friends. after i found out i was pregnant, it came out that he was going with a 14 yr old girl named desiree. i'm 23 he's 19. so i split away from him, him and his family told me that i was going to raise my daughter, and he wasn't going to give me anything, but i was going to let him and desiree take her when ever they wanted. desiree has screamed and cried and told me she has rights to my daughter. desiree is 15 now and she's still doing this. him and desiree and his family has called the welfare on me falsely, i have restraining orders and no contact orders. they have never seen her and never will. that's my daughter, me and my family work and take care of her. a 15 yr old little girl does not have rights to her, him and his family say she's her mother not me. they are crazy. am i right people? thankyou for your answers.
Yes, of course your right...Umm since when does a snooty nosed 15 year old girl get off giving adults orders, especially to you whom she has absolutly no connection with. And because she is only a minor, there is no court on this planet that would even consider giving her any custody rights whatsoever as she has no connection with you or your child. Hell, your ex is also in the sh#t for mandatory rape, if he's going out with this girl and doing the business with her. If I were you, I would move away from all of them to give you at least a mental rest, they all sound like hicks and do you really want your child growing up around people like that. If she continues to do this, I think you need to ring the police yourself and tell them about the situation between this girl and your ex, or ring up a mental health team to come out and get her, she sounds pretty bonkers."

"Changes in DNA due to evolutionary influences?
Describe changes in DNA due to evolutionary influences.
Through a variety of mechanisms, gene flow, mutations, etc... allele frequencies in populations change over time. Some genes are favored while others are not this is how selection and evolution, as it were, work. \n\nSay that there is an organism that has two dominant phenotypes, one green and the other bright purple. If for some reason being one color or the other affects that organisms ability survive and reproduce, then organisms with the preferred phenotype will end up creating a larger percentage of the offspring that those without it. IN this way the population will be directionally selected towards the ""preferred"" phenotype, in this case say purple makes you more attractive to mates so therefore you reproduce more than others of your species that are green.\n\nThe interesting thing is that this is not a one way street and there is no end... this is because the environment is always changing and what was preferred before might be selected against in the future. In this way DNA is always and will always be changing and in that way evolving."

"For commercial electricity generation what is the origin of the magnetic field that is cut by a wire.?
Is the magnetic field the earth's or is it generated by some of the electricity which is generated.
The magnetic field comes from the magnets that are in the generator. The magnets surround the wire coils. As the wire coils rotate, they pass by the magnets. A moving magnetic field (it's all relative, the magnetic field is still in this case) cause a current to be induced in the wire coils, thus producing electricity.\n\nI don't it has much to do with the earth's magnetic field."

The building manager generally does not have a right to an Tenant Association's financial records and the only way they could force you to hand over such records is by a court order which is unlikely. Yet, there are exceptions to this, and it is important that you review your Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and local, and state laws that govern Tenant Associations. They generally have no more right to such records than you do to theirs."
"What should I put on my wedding invite if I want boys to wear a suit and tie?
I don't want to put black tie or lounge suit
Specify ""formal attire"" on your invitation, and spell it out for them: suit and tie for men, dresses or evening gowns for women.  The reason I'd explain it for them is that ""formal"" takes on different meanings to different people... I've seen weddings where some immediate family members (i.e. ones that are supposed to appear in the photos after the ceremony) showed up in their very cleanest wife-beater tee shirts and jeans, and wondered why the bride was so upset."
"what would be the electron capacity of an s, p, and d sublevel?

Sublevel?  I was taught ""subshell"", but the name might have changed.\nAn ""s"" has a single orbital and so can hold 2 electrons.\nA ""p"" has three orbitals and so can hold 6 electrons.\nA ""d"" has 5 orbitals and so can hold 10 electrons.\nYou didn't ask, but an ""f"" has 7 orbitals and can hold 14."
"Why do people say some social mores of the bible are outmoded...but this doesn't apply to homosexuality?
For example:\n\nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?
ToLiveIsToExplore,\nIt true, and I am glad that you noticed. The Laws of before were to illustrate different things, especially having to do with Christ in His relationship to sin, and the human relationship to God. You put way too much down that I want to go through right now, so I'll keep it short, (I'm moving right now).\n\nHomosexuality is not a special sin. It is covered by the blood of Jesus just like any other. So people don't go to Hell for being Gay, rather they go to hell for not trusting God through Jesus Christ.\n\nSo if you are Gay, be Gay and trust God to fulfill His promises. So the focus isn't on sinning, it's about trusting God.\n\nWhy do some Christians bring it up all the time? Because they are not taught the truth. They believe that certain people are worse sinners than they are. And that's a bad attitude. Their pastors are sinning everytime that message is brought by them to the congregation."
"What happened to a Cambodian accountant  in Long Beach charged with inducing Cambodians to file false 1040's?
Charges were made/filed in Long Beach in 2005. Purpose of falsifications was for tax refunds.
Chhun Yasith (aka Cambodian Moses) was born in the Kingdom of Cambodia, he is a Cambodian American.\n\nBiography\nHe left Cambodia fleeing the Khmer Rouge and immigrated to the United States in 1982.\n\nHe became a tax accountant in Long Beach, California.\n\nIn 1988, he returned to Cambodia and joined the opposition Sam Rainsy Party. He then left a year later after becoming convinced that the non-violent opposition was ineffective.\n\nIn 1998, he established the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CCF) an exiled anti-communist organization and serves as their President.\n\nOn June 22, 2001, the Cambodian Criminal Court handed down their verdict on the Cambodian Freedom Fighters attack on November 24, 2000, he was found guilty in absentia and sentenced to life on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism along with Richard Kiri Kim and Thong Samien.\n\nCurrently the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has issued an international Interpol warrant for Chhun Yasith's arrest. He has been unable to persuade the US government to arrest Yasith, however, because the US has no extradition treaty with Cambodia. Yasith has been allowed to stay in the US on the condition that he cease all involvement in terrorist related activity. It is believed the US-led global war on terrorism in response to the events of September 11, 2001 has left Yasith little choice but to remain inactive. Due to these facts, most resources believe no further attacks are expected.\n\n\nNothing new to state."

"Why do catholics use scare tactics to get people to believe in their God?
Catholics say believe or go to hell. Just follow these simple 10 rules (commandments) and you will life forever. but break these rules and your banished to hell. What kind of forgiving and all loving God does this to simple minded unknowing humans especially if he so called created us. If he created us and we screw up doesnt that mean God screwed up and set us up?
Not all chatholics believe this. Generally, however, strong heaven/hell beliefs, in any religion, are a reflection of the person's own level of psychological development. Now I don't have time, obviously, to get into theories of psychological development, so I won't, but without understanding development I think it is harder to answer these kinds of questions, so I will just offer what I can and hope you get the drift.\n\nPeople who have developed to the conventional/mythic-membership level of cognition -- which is the general level of consciousness among fundamentalists and people who adopt conventional religious beliefs such as heaven and hell -- tend to see the world in black and white, good versus evil, us versus them, and therefore tend to project their own psychological orientation toward the world onto God, thus assuming God must be as equally judgemental and vengeful. Since people at the conventional stage of psychological development tend to see those outside of their own group, community, or religious affiliation as a threat, as other, as less than fully human, they assume God will think/feel the same way. \n\nHowever, having said this, there are catholics who happen to be more psychologically developed than this. Some reach the ability for rational cognition (that does not mean the ability to sound rational, but rather the ability to hold perspectives that separate objective its from subjective shoulds), some pluralistic cognition, and some higher. For such people, God will tend to be viewed increasingly as more rational, more pluralistic (in which case, God couldn't possibly hold the tight standards of heaven as hell as a conventionally minded follower would believe), etc, depending on the person's individual cognitive and psychological development. \n\nSo, one's stage of psychological development largely dictates what that person considers to be ""loving"", and therefore they will project their form of ""love"" onto God. For a person developed up to the conventional/mythic-membership level, and no higher, ""love"" means being moral and good to your friends, neihbors, family members, and community, but that love rarely extends to foriegners or outsiders (which is why they tend to be more prone to racism and pro-war positions). Thus, a God who loves his chosen people, but essentially hates and punishes the non-chosen, is not seen to be at odds with their understanding of love.\n\nOn the other hand, someone developed past the conventional/mythic-membership stage, someone with rational or postmodern consciousness, understands love not merely as loving your neighbors, friends, community, and family, but also loving those who are different than you. That is, their sphere of loving embrace is larger, and therefore naturally will assume that God's sphere of love must be larger too.\n\nHope this helps a bit."
"How do I get my 5 yr.old to listen with out yealling and screaming at her?
I just need info on how to get her to pick up things and help around the house and to be a better influence on her brother.
Try making a picture chart of the chores that you would like her to do on a regular basis...put stickers on the chart every time she completes the task.  Offer a prize when a certain amount of stickers are earned.  You may try displaying the prize(in sight but out of reach) in order to inspire her.  Also, making it fun and exciting helps...also lots of verbal praise....making a big a big deal for the little things that she does...\nRemember, she will pick up on your attitude toward your VERY IMPORTANT job.  Tell her how fun it is to do her job and how much fun you have doing your job."

if 13 of children playing hide-and-seek, 3 of them has been found, how many of them still hiden?\nif a tank contains 10 fishes, 8 died, how many left?
9 are still hidden since 1 is the finder person, 3 are found, and the others are all hiding (supposedly... my brother would be in the house raiding the fridge while everyone searched for him).\n\n\nAnd, unless someone removes the fish from the tank, the mere fact that they are dead doesn't exclude them from being in the tank."
"I am very depressed.?
After months of debate, i'm ready to go. any advice on how i should proceed?
I hope by go you mean to seek help. When we are deep in depression it is difficult to see things clearly or to be able to see far ahead. What you need to do is call 911 and tell them you need help. You need to take a break and go to a hospital where you can get the treatment you need. I urge you to please make the call."
"Are humans the only species that are self-aware?  How about the only species to create fast pace technology?

I suppose that it depends on your concept of self-awareness. I recently heard about a study that describes elephants as being aware of their own reflections in mirrors - that is, that they were aware that they were looking at themselves and not at some other creature.\n\nAs for technological development, I guess that if chimpanzees are developing air conditioning for those hot African afternoons, then they've also managed to develop some way to keep it under wraps. :D"

"y called it the funny bone?
why is the funny bone called ""funny bone"", even when u hurt it there's nothing funny abt it.
because of its proximity to the humerus (and the similar word ""humorous""), and because of the mild pain and tingling throughout the forearm associated with sudden compression of the nerve at this point (the label 'funnybone' is thus ironic, since this feeling isn't funny at all)."
"Buying Gifts..?
Just before christmas this year, i will have been with my bf for a whole year. i would like to get his parents a gift(s) but i am not absolutely sure as to what i should get. should i get them a gift collectively, or separately? any good ideas?
Unless you two are very close to his parents (as in the four of you go out to dinner together and have fun), I would still give them a gift from you separate from what he gives them.  Give them a gift for both of them, unless you have some super idea for each of them individually.\n\nRestaurant gift certificates are good.  If you guys like theatre and you have a local community theatre who does a good production, tickets to a holiday show are nice.  Foodstuffs are very appropriate - wine (if they drink), fancy olive oil, cheese, etc.  And never underestimate the appreciation of something homemade!"

"please answer the following question in detail.?
the population of a state increases 4% anually.If the population was 16016 at the end of 2002,the population at the beggining of 2002 was how much?
If the population increases by 4% each year, at the end of the year the population will be 104% of the original population at the start of the year.\nSo, the population at the end of the year is 16016, which is 104% of the original.\nSo 100% would be the popluation at the start of the year.\nUsing ratio and algebra:\n16016/104 = x/100\nx = 100*16016/104\nTherefore, x = 15400.\nTherefore the popluation at the start of 2002 was 15400.\nDouble check by doing the question in reverse, now that you have the original popluation.\n\n4% of 15400 = 616\n\n15400 + 616 = 16016\n\nTherefore you can be sure that the original population at the start of the year was 15400."
"When I am tense, I start sweating & my vision go blank?
This problem appeared about 12 years back first, I consulted a Doctor, he says it is due to mental stress and advised ALPRAZOLAM. Problem appears again after months at similar situation. Is there any permanent remidy for this. Please suggest
definitely sounds like a panic attack.  \n\nWhat is happening is that you become ""scared"" of the feeling of panic there fore you are sent into a ""panic attack"".  Also you are internalizing a lot of stress and you're body needs an outlet so it sends a large release through an attack.  After your ""attack"" is over do you feel sleepy?  Well that the feeling you get after an attack along with sweating.  You need to release more emotion, and stress, try crying, try exercise, try talking to people about your problems, try getting better sleep as well.  The way I overcame them is to control them and stop letting them control me.  If I felt a panic attack coming on I take deep breaths close my eyes and think for a minute."

"how many grams of protein equal one serving of protein?

There is no such thing as a 'serving' of protein, but if you look at those nutrition facts on the back of any food product, they base the percentages off of about 50g of protein per day.  A good rule to follow is that you need to each about 40% of your body weight in grams of protein each day to avoid atrophy.  If you weigh 200 pounds, you'd want to be eating at least 80g of protein each day."

human,man\ncable ,(optic fiber,wire,sat(electromagnetic),etc)
There is a theory stating that the universe can be composed of information.  However, transmitting an object through a network or a cable means that you have to ""transform"" the object´s atomic structure and make it compatible with the format and bandwith of the means you are using to transmit it.  Theoretically it is possible (like in the movie ""The fly""), but current science has still its limitations about it."

"how can i lose 25 pounds in 35 days?

Cut out ALL fast food, junk food, and anything sweet that's not naturally sweet.\n\nEat low-cal vegetables (potatoes are NOT low-cal and neither are most beans) Eat spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery, brussel sprouts, etc. DO NOT eat them with ANY oil or condiments\n\nEat low fat protein. Ex: chicken, fish, lowfat yogurt, egg whites. DO NOT use oil on them. use herbs to season and use water in the pan to make them not stick\n\nEat at most 2 friuts a day and if you must eat something grainy (bread/pasta) try eating oatmeal instead of bread or pasta\n\nDONT use artificial sweeteners... they SAY no calories but they will still make you gain weight (trust me on this one).\n\nDrink only water, plain tea, or plain coffee. A glass of milk is ok but only one.\n\nCoffee speeds up your metabolism.\n\nSkipping a meal is a good idea too. The whole ""your body thinks you're starving and doesn't burn calories"" thing is a MYTH! It only does that when you are anorexic.(IF YOU ARE THIN ALREADY DO NOT DO ANY OF WHAT THIS SAYS!!!)\n\nCount your calories. I'm not sure how much you weigh so I can't tell you how many to eat but I do not go over 1000 calories. If you're more than 140 pounds I'd up that number but im not sure to how much...\n\nEXCERCISE!!! Do at least 30 min of hard cardio (i.e. running) EVERY DAY!!!!!\n\nDon't do this for too long though... this is a crash diet and works but don't stay on too long and when you stop, be careful not to binge eat from deprivation.\n\nGood luck and stay safe."
"Anyone can answer!!?
My friend has herpes and she's having sex with a lot of guys.Can she give herpes to them even using protection?And is it wrong for me to tell the guys that she herpes??
Absolutely she can give it to them.  Condom boxes even have warnings on them for that.  She can also transmit it through oral sex.  Whether its wrong for you to tell the guys about her condition depends on your relationship w/ the guys.  Are they related to you or have you known them a long time?  If not, then I would say no, stay out of it because it could be misconstrued as slander from you or gossiping.  The friend needs to grow up and do whats right herself and tell the guys.  She obviously has more problems than she can handle as it is since you specify ""guys"" as in more than one which is probably how she got it in the first place.  As a friend, you should strongly encourage her to get both medical and psychiatric help for the 2 problems.  Give her emotional support but otherwise stay out of it."

why is it when i eat all three meals a day the next morning my stomach is bigger to me....but when i dont eat alot...the next morning my stomach is really tiny!
It's not the number of meals you eat,but more likely to be the content of the food. Especially sodium(salt) which in women tends to make them retain water and feel or look blotted. More so if it close to the time of your period. So don't skip meals my dear, that will slow your metabalism, which will lead to weight gain. Maybe just watch your salt intake, drink lots of water and maybe if needed get a water pill. G'luck"
"Is it important to always be honest?
I'm trying out a total honesty policy at the moment. The only problem is do people always want to hear the truth?
Immanuel Kant (a famous philosopher) said it is crucial to be honest because lying is the worst thing a person can do. This is because our society is built on trust.  All the time we trust people not to do curtain things (like blow-up the place you are in).  If you lie, you break down the trust that keep society together and if people lie to much, society will crumble to nothing.  For me sometimes you have to lie, but most time it is good to be honest."

"Is it right to thank god for having unhealthy food for dinner?
Lots of people thank god right before they eat but lots of times the food is not even good for them.  So, god bless them with unhealthy food?  If god didn't bless them with unhealthy food, why didn't god prevent them from thanking him for something he didn't do.  Isn't it morally wrong for god to accept a thanks for something he didn't even do?
You live in a house, you can thank God for the house.\nYou live in a condo, you can thank God for the condo.\nYou live in a studio bedroom on the East Side and hear gunfire at night. Is it wrong to thank God for keeping you from being homeless?\n\nIn the same way, you can thank God for healthy food, for unhealthy food, or for having nothing.\n\nIf you believe that God is Creator of all things, then all food (as well, as housing, love, children, laughter, air, etc.) is a gift from Him. And saying thanksgiving does not behold God to you; it is merely a gesture of appreciation."
"help please?
ive been having very thick periods why?\nmy mom says its normal
Heavy periods are normal. It can mean that you have a very healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise. If you are hoping to regulate or lower the flow of your period you should consider speaking with your doctor about birth control as certain times of birth control pills will reduce your periods flow."
"How do you find a point at a given distance?
Given a line l (y = mx + b), a point p(x,y) on l, and a distance d, how do you calculate a point that is d far away from p and on l ?
1.  Find the line that goes through d that is perpendicular to line l.  The slope of the perpendicular line is -1/m, where m is the slope from line l.  Since you have the slope for that line, then just plug in d to get the intercept, which I will call c.\n\n2.  Find the point (x,y) where the two lines meet by solving the system of equations.\n\ny = mx + b\ny = (-1/m)x + c\n\nI will call this point e.\n\n3.  Find the distance between d and e.  If d = (x1,y1) and e = (x2,y2) then the distance between d and e is\n\nsqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)"
"Is Hell eternal according to Revelation 20:13?
Revelation 20:13 states: ""The sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead in them."" As Jesus promised, ""the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus's] voice and come out."" (John 5:28, 29) Although no longer presently existing in any form, millions of dead ones who are in Jehovah God's memory will be resurrected, or brought back to life, in a restored earthly paradise.—Luke 23:43; Acts 24:15.
The English word ""hell"" is not a biblically precise term.\n\nSome bibles use ""hell"" to translate the Hebrew word ""Sheol"", the Greek word ""Hades"", and the Greek word ""Gehenna""; other bibles consider these three terms to be proper nouns and so leave the capitalized original-language names untranslated in their English translations. \n\nBoth ""Sheol"" and ""Hades"" clearly refer to the common grave of mankind, the condition of being dead from which resurrection is possible. ""Gehenna"" refers to death without the possibility of resurrection; ""Gehenna"" is synonymous with the bible expressions ""lake of fire"" and ""the second death"".\n\nNone of these terms, and nothing in the bible, teaches that ""hell"" is a fiery place of torment.\n\n(Ecclesiastes 9:10) there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [""hell""]\n\n(Revelation 20:14) And death and Hades [""hell""] were hurled into the lake of fire\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20020715/article_02.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20020601/article_02.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/lmn/article_07.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20010901/article_02.htm"

"How to stop giving a parent money?
My mom asks me for money, and I can't tell her no. She says she will pay me back, but never does.  I can't tell her no because then she will be mad at me.  So I give it to her.  I can't keep doing this. By the way, Im 18 and living at home.
Part of living at home is dealing with things like this. Depending on how much money you are giving to your mother, think of it as more of a cost of living there. If you are able to live elsewhere, for less - you MAY consider that - but don't forget - there is a whole lot more - utilities, insurance, you'll be alone or with someone that is not your mother - which means (if you are sharing) they can disappear at any time and leave you stuck with rent/bills etc.\n\nKeep track of the money, via an excel spreadsheet or even simple pen and paper. If your mother pays you back one day, great! - if not - then it was just the cost of your being safe in a place that you know - which is usually better than being in a place you don't know, with people you think you know.\n\nI Hope this helps.\n\nGood luck!"
"selection of transformers?
How do we do selection of transformer with a given specific load
First, what is the input voltage and the desired output voltage?  Is the output voltage fixed, or do you need a range of adjustment (taps)?  Do you need isolation between the input and the output?  If not, an autotransformer (single winding) might be acceptable.  What is the frequency, and is it single phase, three phase Y, or three phase delta?\n\nNext, what is the power rating?  Small transformers are usually rated in output current, whereas larger transformers are rated in KVA.  This is the maximum load;  a smaller load would not be a problem.\n\nFinally, what are the mechanical factors?  Does it need to be hermetic or can it be open frame?  Do you want terminals or wire leads?  What shape and size?  What is the mounting?\n\nIt's not really that hard.  Usually you can browse through a catalog and find the transformer you need in minutes."
"How exactly does the EKG machine work?

<>An EKG (or ECG) takes sequential readings of the electrical signal generated by the heart.  It does so using a series of electrodes: 1 is placed on each limb and readings are taken from arm to arm and arm to leg (a total of 6 readings).  5 electrodes are placed across the chest and each of those readings recorded.  The 12 readings (a 12-lead EKG) give different views of the electrical conductivity of the heart and can be interpreted by a trained reader to divulge a number of different problems."

Don't know where Indy T got his information, but in Modern Psychiatry Psychopathy is usually diagnosed according to Robert D. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist:  Intraspecies predators who use charm, manipulation, intimidation, and violence to control others and satisfy their own needs, lacking in conscience and feelings for others, they violate social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regret.  The mother of my daughter was such a person, she ran off with another man when our daughter was 5 months old and left her behind.  Then she tried to get our daughter back so I would have to give her money, she even offered to let me keep custody as long as the money came in.  She took me to court and I won, I ended up with a daughter any father could be proud of.  That is how this one person dealt with it."
"What is the significance of remembering people, & things at age  of 2 1/2-5 and academic success  as  adult?
My earliest memory is walking across the road to my Grandma and Grandpa's house and sitting on Grandpa's lap on the porch. I thought it to be a dream until I saw a picture of him. According to the funeral notice, I was 2 1/2.
Some people with Alzheimer's disease can remember things that happened _many_ years ago with great clarity, without being able to remember what they were doing an hour ago.\n\nSo in other words, being able to remember something that happened when you were younger does not necessarily mean anything.\n\nExcept the fact that you remember your grandpa.  I have a grandpa who died when I was real young, and I wish I could remember him. :("
"So if gay people are going to hell...?
The most popular answer to my last question 'why is it a sin to be gay' was 'because god/the bible says so'.  So here's my next question.  If you really think that it's a sin to be gay, in your version of reality all gay people will be going to hell.  So if god will punish them forever for their lifestyle, why do you have to do so as well?  We've established that they aren't hurting anyone, so why not leave them to it and trust god to punish them?\n\nAlso, since we have now established that it's a religious reason that being gay is 'wrong' and not one you can back up with any facts about how it hurts people, then why are you trying to deny gay people legal rights?  Many of them don't believe in your religion - why do you have the right to force it on them?  It's not a moral issue if no one is getting hurt.
If we are going to invoke Leviticus to condemn homosexuality then we must also remember that the Bible calls for the execution of homosexuals. Not only that but it calls for the stoning of disobedient children and adulterers. I wish that fundamentalist/evangelical Christians would not be so selective in their application of scripture. And to the guy who says that 80% of homosexuals have AIDS? Where on earth did you get such a ridiculous statistic? I've never heard such rubbish in all my life."

"Which way will the equilibrium shift when HCl is added to Mg(OH)2(s) <--> Mg2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)?
Also, if this isnt too much of a bother, which way will it shift when Na2EDTA is added? And is the reaction endothermic or exothermic? 10 points to clearest answer. Thanks!
The reaction Mg(OH)2 <--> Mg+2 + 2OH- will turn to the right when hydrochloric acid is added. This is because the acid eats away the hydroxides, and due to LeChatelier's principle, the equilibrium must shift to the right to account for this loss.\n\nAs for the Na2(EDTA), it will also shift to the right. The EDTA will form a complex with the magnesium ions, again, lowering the concentration of the Mg+2, so the equilibrium shifts to the right. Keep in mind that complex ions only form in molecules with empty d-orbitals.\n\nThis reaction is endothermic, like all dissolution (dissolving) reactions are. It takes energy to break the ions out of the crystal lattice structure."
"why will a shipwrecked crew die if they drink saltwater?

Basically because of a phenomenon called Osmosis, which is the exchange of water or other liquids through a membrane in order to get an equilibrium between dissolved substances and the pressure on the membrane.\n\nThe liquids in the human body have a salt content of roughly 0.9% (aka isotonic solution). Sea water has salt contents up to 3.5% (disregarding the Dead Sea and similar evaporation basins).\n\nLow salt content water (from the body cells) will go through the membranes into the salt water. Effectively, the body dries up even though a person has drunk salt water.\n\nNote, however, that salt water near isotonic values can be drunk in case of emergencies. E.g. before river mouths or in inland seas or bays, freshwater addition can dilute sea water to survivable salt contents."
"23 year old with chest pains?
For about week I have had a dull ache right in the centre of my chest. It comes on suddedely without cause and feels like it is winding me at times. Sometimes I wake up with it. It comes and goes and lasts about 2-3 minutes each time. At first I thought it was heartburn but now im not to sure as it doesn't happen after eating and feels nothing like it. I have no other symptoms such as a cough or anything. I am fairly healthy, not overweight but i am a smoker.  Does any know what this could be, could it be heart related? Should I be worried as other then the pain I feel fine?
First of all, you DO need to go to the Dr.\n\nBut I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. It's probably GERD (Reflux Disease) which would be exacerbated by the smoking by the way. Reflux doesn't have to be just after eating. My bet is that, whatever it is.. it's probably related to the upper gastro-intestinal track and most likely easily fixed. \n\nHOWEVER: GERD that goes without treatment is the leading cause of esophageal cancer, which is deadly and with the smoking, you're at even a higher risk. So, the first thought is still an important one... go see your Doctor ;-)\n\n----\nI doubt it's pleurisy... Pleuratic traumas are usually sharper pains and are persistent, not ""come and go."" Also, shortness of breath is also associated with pleurisy."
"what is the difference between a community foundation and other foundations?

I think the nature of the Foundations funds probably distinguishes Community and other foundations.\n\nThere are many privately funded Foundations; The Ford Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundations, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to name a few.\n  \nThese Foundations are governed by state and federal laws, but generally form, fund and administer themselves, and apply for certain preferential tax treatment. Many are dedicated to diverse causes: the status women throughout the world, education, libraries, literacy, etc. that benefit the global or local community, but they seek and choose the focus of their giving and must be prepared to demonstrate the charitable nature of their activities to maintain their preferred tax status.\n\nI would think a community Foundation's focus was on some specific endeavor that provided for the possibility of tax deductible contributions, so are publicly funded by donors  interested in the Foundation's goals.  If NPR and PBS had Foundations their focus would by on communications, and those set up at universities might be to financially aid their students."
"How many humans has Satan killed?

Killed those chasing the Israelites in the red sea. Ex 14:27-28\n. Killed the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites over a promise to Abraham for some land. Deut 7:1,2\n. Killed 14,700 people by plague who protested to Moses about the prior killing of the 250 princes. Aaron makes an atonement to stop the plague. Num 16:41-49\n\nWhat passages show Satan killing anything?
Satan isn't evil, he was an angel.  Satan is a title given to an angel who is an ""adversary"" of man, like ""that angel was the satan""  They are our enemy, but they are still one of God's angels, loved by Him.  Not only has God killed way more people than the cliched Devil, but he also has angels whose only job is to kill people.  And they probably are still used, well, if God exists that is."

"How does a volcano form?

Like most of the interior of the earth, the movements and dynamics of magma are poorly understood. However, it is known that an eruption usually follows movement of magma upwards into the solid layer (the earth's crust) beneath a volcano and occupying a magma chamber. Eventually, magma in the chamber is forced upwards and flows out across the planet surface as lava, or the rising magma can heat water in the surrounding landform and cause explosive discharges of steam; either this or escaping gases from the magma can produce forceful ejections of rocks, cinders, volcanic glass, and/or volcanic ash also known as tephra. While always displaying powerful forces, eruptions can vary from effusive to extremely explosive.\n\nMost volcanoes on the land are formed at destructive plate margins: where oceanic crust is forced below the continental crust because oceanic crust is denser than continental crust. As the oceanic crust 'subducts', it is forced into a higher-temperature region called the asthenosphere, and melts. Friction between these moving plates may also be a cause of melting. The reduced density of the melting rock forces the newly formed magma to rise. As the magma rises through weak areas in the continental crust it may eventually erupt as one or more volcanoes. For example, Mount St. Helens is found inland from the margin between the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate and the continental North American Plate. The oceanic crust is normally a highly-'mafic' (iron and magnesium rich) rock, but as it rises through granitic (more silicic) continental plates, it may cause 'partial melting' of both mantle rocks and the plate rocks, producing magmas of varying silicity. Volcanic arcs forming near subduction zones, on the edges of continental plates, usually form high-silicity (high-viscosity) stratovolcanoes. Examples include the South American Andes and the Cascade range.\n \nA volcano generally presents itself to the imagination as a mountain sending forth from its summit great clouds of smoke with vast sheets of flame. The truth is that a volcano seldom emits either smoke or flame, although various combinations of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur do sometimes ignite. What is mistaken for smoke consists of vast volumes of fine dust (called volcanic ash), mingled with steam and other vapors, chiefly sulfurous. Most of what appears to be flames is the glare from the erupting materials, glowing because of their high temperature; this glare reflects off the clouds of dust and steam, resembling fire.\n\nPerhaps the most conspicuous part of a volcano is the crater, a basin of a roughly circular shape, formed by a vent (or vents) from which magma erupts as gases, lava, and ejecta. A crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of vast depth. Very large features of this sort are termed calderas. Some volcanoes consist of a crater alone, with scarcely any mountain at all; but in the majority of cases the crater is situated on top of a mountain (the volcano), which can tower to an enormous height. Volcanoes that terminate in a principal crater are usually of a conical form.\n\nVolcanic cones are usually smaller features composed of loose ash and cinder, with occasional masses of stone which have been tossed violently into the air by the eruptive forces (and are thus called ejecta). Within the crater of a volcano there may be numerous cones from which vapours are continually issuing, with occasional volleys of ashes and stones. In some volcanoes these cones form lower down the mountain, along rift zones or fractures. When the cone is eroded these rifts or lava filled fractures remain as radial near vertical dikes of volcanic rock. For example the radiating dikes at Shiprock in NW New Mexico."
"Difference between Liposculpture and Brazilian Butt Lift ?
Well, i been doing some research and it says that lipoesculpture consist of removing fat from certain areas and filling other parts of the body such as the butt with this fat. Is this the same as brazilian butt lift? LIPOSCULPTURE NOT LIPOSUCTION, WHICH IS JUST SUCKING FAT
One procedure is the buttocks implant, which consists in placing silicone implants in the buttocks zone to enhance it. Another is the buttocks lift, in which the extra skin is removed to eliminate sagging. A third procedure is the buttocks enhancement through fat transference, in which a liposuction is performed and the fat is placed in the buttocks zone, to enhance it. Liposuction and liposculpture are the same things, just two words for the same procedure. Check out http://www.surgeryabroadguide.com for very good advice and prices."
"How to nudists stop sunburn?
I mean on the parts that the sun doesn't normally see!
Nudists work up a tan just like anyone else. Sunscreen, exposure and shade when their skin has had enough sun. But because they don't wear clothes unless nature or society outside their group requires it, nudists also get wind burned which helps keep their skin tanned so they can withstand more sun.\n\nThink about driving your car with your window down on a cloudy day. You are wearing a t-shirt and your arm is resting in the window. Even though the sun is hidden behind clouds you can still end up with your arm looking sun burned from exposure to the wind.\n\nThe combination of sun and wind can keep their skin tanned longer so they don't need as much protection as a non-nudist does."
"what is the California age limit to disalow dependent on our insurance?
Our son is in college still and our insurance kicked him off.  He now has to have open heart surgery.  We have gotten him some insurance but it doesn't cover everything like ours did.
its usually up to the company when they purchase the policy, most companies go with age 23 providing that the dependant is a full time student and 19 if they are not. Dependant children do, however, have their own right to COBRA, which extends their coverage for 18 months. After COBRA ends you sometimes have the right to CAL-COBRA which is another 18 months. As soon as all COBRA options are exhausted, you have the right to purchase a private health plan anwhere, called a HIPAA plan. The COBRA laws are regulated by the department of Labor, and the IRS. If you do not elect COBRA, your son will have to get MRMIP (Major Risk insurance) which is not a fun process. Having heart surjury means he is un-insurable for the rest of his life in the private sector, he will either have to get the HIPAA plan, or work somewhere with group insurance benefits. Good luck to you!!! (Sometimes when a child is extremely dependant you can go through a special appeal to keep them on your plan, but it may be very difficult)"
"What gas traps Earth s heat and may cause the ""greenhouse effect""?

Short Answer: Carbon dioxide.\n\nLong answer:\nGlobal warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades.\n\nThe prevailing scientific opinion on climate change is that ""most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities"".\n\nThe increased amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the primary causes of the human-induced component of warming. They are released by the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing and agriculture, etc. and lead to an increase in the greenhouse effect. The first speculation that a greenhouse effect might occur was by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1897, although it did not become a topic of popular debate until some 90 years later."

"Where on the bible does it say that masturbating is wrong/sin??

Here's the reference from which most people conclude that mastrubation is wrong:\nhttp://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=1&chapter=38&version=31&context=chapter\nThey draw an analogy between what Onan did (ejaculating without the intent of procreation) and mastrubation (which is just that).  However, some scholars believe that God put Onan to death because he did not fulfill his responsibility to his late brother's wife (in spite of being told to do so by God himself).  There are also other parts of the Bible that suggest that semen causes things to become impure, like this one:\nhttp://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2015:17\nAs far as I know, the Christian restriction on mastrubation is a recommendation inferred from the Bible.  The case against mastrubation is not totally clear, but there's enough room for doubt as to its acceptability.  I hope this answers your question!"

And so we will be with the Lord forever.\n\n-Those who believe now will be taken home with the Lord Jesus- for he is coming for ""his sheep""\n\n\nJohn 10:27\nMy sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me."
"why do pple look so much into GPA????
don't you think that great people come in all GPA sizes??? \nShould pple get/lose a job solely on gpa? \n(GPA = grade point average)
I really don't think jobs place that much stock into a G.P.A.  I have never been asked for one (I have a good one. I just don't feel it is any of their business)  I think colleges place much more emphasize on the G.P.A. and even they are starting to loosen up on their requirements for entry.  People are starting to realize just because you were a 2.5 student might not make you any worse of a employee than a 4.0 student.  In fact i would take some of the 2.5 students anytime.\n\n\nI know many people that are in human resource and I live in a major metro area...they all tell me the same thing no one has time to check on your G.P.A.  If you go to a prestigious school you must have had a good G.P.A or your parent were alumni that is the way it works.  I am telling you most people on jobs do not really care about your G.P.A.\n\nA) It does not indicate to the employer how you will perform\nB)  They can not tell without your transcript if you had a lot of Mickey Mouse classes to try and keep the grade point high along with your core curriculum.\nC)  They do not have the time or patience to check the accuracy of it...most job s today are understaffed and overworked.\nD)  They might ask you but they really do not care in the long run.\n\nI have asked several people I know that are managers in major corporations and that work in human resource and I got the same answers you figure it out."
"Is it wrong to consider sex outside marriage as a means of enjoyment and entertainment like you enjoy movies?
Can the above question be looked from a completely different perspective, so as to get the right answers without predjudice. I mean we enjoy a lot of movies, we go for a drink etc.....we do all this in marriage as a source of entertainment and enjoyment. So why not sex. Another point to this is that having sex outside marriage does not mean that you do not love your wife.
Trying not to be prejudice...... but a great movie sex.... they cant be the same, a movie affects you in a little way possible while sex is more of an intimate thing that you share with your partner are whoever you are with. So to compare movies and sex....i think thats a big nono....\n\n\n\nXoXo\nme"

"What are Credit Derivatives ?
This is related to capital markets and investment banking
(m)\n\nA credit derivative is an OTC derivative designed to transfer credit risk from one party to another. By synthetically creating or eliminating credit exposures, they allow institutions to more effectively manage credit risks. Credit derivatives take many forms. Three basic structures include: \n\ncredit default swap: Two parties enter into an agreement whereby one party pays the other a fixed periodic coupon for the specified life of the agreement. The other party makes no payments unless a specified credit event occurs. Credit events are typically defined to include a material default, bankruptcy or debt restructuring for a specified reference asset. If such a credit event occurs, the party makes a payment to the first party, and the swap then terminates. The size of the payment is usually linked to the decline in the reference asset's market value following the credit event. \n\ntotal return swap: Two parties enter an agreement whereby they swap periodic payment over the specified life of the agreement. One party makes payments based upon the total return—coupons plus capital gains or losses—of a specified reference asset. The other makes fixed or floating payments as with a vanilla interest rate swap. Both parties' payments are based upon the same notional amount. The reference asset can be almost any asset, index or basket of assets. \n\ncredit linked note: A debt instrument is bundled with an embedded credit derivative. In exchange for a higher yield on the note, investors accept exposure to a specified credit event. For example, a note might provide for principal repayment to be reduced below par in the event that a reference asset defaults prior to the maturity of the note. \n\nThe fundamental difference between a credit default swap and a total return swap is the fact that the credit default swap provides protection against specific credit events. The total return swap provides protection against loss of value irrespective of cause—a default, market sentiment causing credit spreads to widen, etc."
"What is fictitious 'centrifugal' force and examples.?

Let's say you are in a car going fast around a sharp left turn. You'll feel a force pulling you to the right side of the car. This is fictitious centrifugal force. It is ""fictitious"" because it only exists from the point of view of the person in the car. If you are looking at the situation from another reference frame, there is no such force.\n\nFor an example of another reference frame, pretend you have a tetherball attached to a pole. You throw the ball (give it velocity in one direction) and the tether exerts a force on it pulling it towards the pole (making its path curve). This is called centripetal force. It is always the same magnitude as the ficticious centrifugal force but it is in the opposite direction. The difference is that you can see this force (the rope pulling against the ball) from any reference frame.\n\nHere's another good example. You know those carnival rides that you sit in a chair and they spin around (see picture, because I don't know what they're called - http://wplr.com/images/clipart/carnival-swing-ride.jpg ). If you're in the chair, you experience ficticious centrifugal force. If you're watching, you don't see any centrifugal force, but you do see the centripetal force (the chains holding the chairs from swinging off the ride)."
"Can both parents claim a child in different households if they both had him for 6 months of the year?
They are divorced and both have had him for 6 months each. He now lives with us but she is telling us she is claiming him this year and we can't. SO I want to know if we both can since with both have had him equally 6 months
That a diffent NO.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Code, the parent who pays for more than 50% of the children's expenses (including the children's portion of rent or mortgage, utilities, household food, car gas for transportation, etc.) gets to claim the children as a tax exemption. This is usually the parent with whom the children live more than one-half the year. With that said, under New Mexico domestic relations law, the parents are free to negotiate how to allocate the tax exemptions for children. Keep in mind that child support amounts presume that the parent receiving child support also claims the children as a tax exemption; thus, if you receive child support and you give up the exemptions, you should really be getting more in monthly child support. Also, getting the tax exemptions assumes the receiving parent is working full-time and getting the maximum benefit from the tax exemptions."

"Why do our rivers wind lazily back and forth instead of a flowing in a straight line.?

The winding nature of many river channels is called meandering, also referred to as sinuosity. The sinuosity of a river is not just the result of water taking the easiest path. There are many internal and external factors that determine the overall channel pattern. To some extent there is still debate within the science about what factors are most important.  There are mathematical formulas that can be used to compare different rivers, but they are not quite good enough to actually explain all the variables yet. \n\nIf you look at a map you will see that the sinuosity of a river has a predictable wavelength (length of a full turn) and amplitude (width of a meander across the river flood plain), so it is clearly not a random process. One useful formula that relates the bankfull discharge of a river to its meander wavelength is the following:\n\nLength of meander=L\nBankfull discharge (volume of the river)= Qb\n\nL=54.3 (square root of Qb)\n\nThe factors that affect the size of meanders that are external to the river are things like the type and density of vegetation along the river bank, the type of material in the river bed and bank, the overall volume and variability of the river volume, and the overall gradient of the river. The higher the gradient the less likely a river will meander. Rivers that meander widely are typically flowing across a river-deposited flood plain of sand, silt and clay materials, but because these materials are not always deposited evenly the inconsistency will affect the river channel migration. Along many meandering rivers there are forests growing, and as trees fall into the rivers they can have major effects on the current flow.  \n\nThe internal factors probably have much more to do with the strong tendency of rivers to meander (at least that is my opinion) and create the regularity of meanders. Small oscillations within flowing water creates alternating bed profiles along the length of most rivers. These alternating bed profiles correspond to higher and lower gradients resulting in faster and slower speeds of flow.  These two bed profiles are known as riffles and pools. The riffles are typically spaced about 5-7 times the width of the river apart, along the length of the river and usually have bottom sediments of the largest size found in the river (more gravel, cobbles, etc). Turbulence in the river created by these variations in the bottom of the river creates cyclone-like spirals of water that will both erode the bottoms of pools and when they diverge they will build bars and riffles in the middle of the channel. \n\nThis internal turbulence also causes bank erosion, and once it begins it is self-perpetuating. As the meander begins to form, the water moving along the outside of the meander actually piles up, causing more bank erosion, and the higher speed of the water along the outside of the meander also allows the water to erode and carry more material. Meanwhile, the inside of the meander is the slowest moving water and will deposit material, building a sand bar, also called a point bar.\n\nThe meanders eventually reach a limit of size (amplitude) either when they encounter the edge of the flood plain and bedrock, or when they get so wide they begin to intersect each other. As this happens the river will cut them off forming an oxbow. Other times at flood stage a river will scour away the point bars and abandon its own meanders until flow returns to normal and the process of building meanders starts anew. \n\nHere is a good resource with some illustrations of the process:\nhttp://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/6664/6664.ch04.html"
"If killing is wrong in any religion, then what are ""holy wars"" about?
Either killing is wrong, or it's acceptable. I don't see room for any ""gray"" areas here.
Holy wars are generally fueled by people who don't understand religion.  While they may genuinely believe that they are doing God's will or whatever, that believe does not come from the religion itself, but rather from political leaders who are either extremely confused or (more likely) are co-opting religion for their own agenda.\n\n______\nI disagree with kunwarrarra's statement that ""killing in war is never murder.""  Taking a life is never justified, no matter who tells you to do it.  Incidently, I have heard scholars of Islam argue that the religion does not allow killing, and that Jihad refers to an internal struggle rather than an external war."

"If I have multiple credit card balances, how do I determine which to pay the most to each month?

Pay the one with the highest APR first. To get them all paid off though,.. whatever the minimum payment is right now - pay that EVERY month - even when the min amt due changes and lowers - don't do it. Stick with the curent amount. When you get the first one paid off, take the money you were using on that one and put it toward the card with the highest APR. Keep doing this. You will have your cards paid off completely in a few years. I had over $20K in credit cards and in less than 4 years, I'm down to 2 cards - one with $3000 and one with about $600. Good luck."
"Are Medical Doctors Scientists?
Medical professionals like radiologists, neurologists, cardiologists, oncologists, pathologists, and many more specialists seem to be doing scientific work to me; they are certainly biologists. Are they considered 'SCIENTISTS'?
It depends.\n\nMany medical schools issue two types of degrees.\n\nThe first, the M.D., is given to those who practice medicine. This is the doctor that you are used to seeing at the local hospital or clinic.\n\nThe second degree is the M.D. PhD. This degree is obtained by those who seek to conduct research in the field of medicine.\n\nIn a general sense, an M.D. would be considered a primary medical caregiver while an M.D. PhD would be considered a scientist. You will occasionally find those with an M.D. degree working in the field of research, though."

So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the devil's strategy is ever weak,"" (Quran 4:76). \nKill those against Islam:  ""The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land.

"Who discover the alpha decay?
or at least whose the first one discover it or find out about it?
Radioactivity was first discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel while working on phosphorescent materials. These materials glow in the dark after exposure to light, and he thought that the glow produced in cathode ray tubes by X-rays might somehow be connected with phosphorescence. So he tried wrapping a photographic plate in black paper and placing various phosphorescent minerals on it. All results were negative until he tried using uranium salts. The result with these compounds was a deep blackening of the plate.\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do with phosphorescence because the plate blackened when the mineral was kept in the dark. Also non-phosphorescent salts of uranium and even metallic uranium blackened the plate. Clearly there was some new form of radiation that could pass through paper that was causing the plate to blacken.\n\nAt first it seemed that the new radiation was similar to the then recently discovered X-rays. However further research by Becquerel, Marie Curie, Pierre Curie, Ernest Rutherford and others discovered that radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Different types of decay can occur.\n\nFor instance, it was found that an electric or magnetic field could split such emissions into three beams. For lack of better terms, the rays were given the alphabetic names alpha, beta, and gamma, names they still hold today. It was immediately obvious from the direction of electromagnetic forces that alpha rays carried a positive charge, beta rays carried a negative charge, and gamma rays were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was also clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles. Passing alpha rays through a thin glass membrane and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the resulting gas, and ultimately prove that alpha particles are in fact helium nuclei. Other experiments showed the similarity between beta radiation and cathode rays; they are both streams of electrons, and between gamma radiation and X-rays.\n\nThese researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements have radioactive isotopes. Radioactivity also guided Marie Curie to isolate radium from barium; the two elements' chemical similarity would otherwise have made them difficult to distinguish.\n\nThe dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X-rays when an Serbo-Croatian-American electric engineer Nikola Tesla intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1896. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he attributed them to ozone rather than to the X-rays. Fortunately his injuries healed later.\n\nThe genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. It was only in 1927 that Hermann Joseph Muller published his research that showed the genetic effects. In 1947 he was awarded the Nobel prize for his findings.\n\nBefore the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine and Radioactive quackery; particularly alarming examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood (Curie later died from aplastic anemia assumed due to her own work with radium, but later examination of her bones showed that she had been a careful laboratory worker and had a low burden of radium; a better candidate for her disease was her long exposure to unshielded X-ray tubes while a volunteer medical worker in WW I). By the 1930's, after a number of cases of bone-necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had all but vanished from the market.\n"

because everyone is unique in their own way. with people of the same race, they can often band together and feel like there's someone that is like them in the sense that they come from the same culture. some people feel better if there are others like them so that they feel less insecure about themselves. also, some of these groups have been persecuted throughout history causing them to unite for support."

He said those who claim to be Jews. To answer this we have to define what a Jew is. When the scripture was written the word Jew meant Judah. Just Judah a member of the tribe of Judah only and not all the tribes of Israel. So what he is saying is their will be those who claim to be Jews(Judahies thus Israelites) and are not but do lie.

"I am wanting to go to mortuary school to learn to embalm. does anyone know how much they make a year?
I live in west alabama and don't really want to relocate
It depends on where you live. I don't know specifics about Alabama.\nThe licensing requirements differ by state, but in most states, you have to have a license to embalm or conduct funerals. In fact, people without licenses are sometimes not even supposed to be present when a person is being embalmed. Sometimes there are two different licenses--one for being a funeral director and one for embalming. Sometimes one license covers both.\nYou will make more money being a funeral director and an embalmer than just one or the other.\nYou can call your state licensing board and them what the requirements are. They may have a pretty good idea of what salaries are, too. You could also ask them about mortuary science colleges in your state. The staff there would know salary figures very accurately. \nPeople who own funeral homes do make more money than people who work for them. But it can take years to build up to owning a home. I think it's good to get a lot of experience first. \nI disagree that it is not hard work. I think it is very hard. It can be draining, due to the sheer volume of work that can develop. And sometimes it will come before sleep, or family activities. But it is exceptionally rewarding and fulfilling. If you feel called to do it, then please look into it.\nI disagree that there is a lot of money in selling pre-arrangements. It can be lucrative, but it is very hard to make a lot of money doing it because it depends on how long people live after they have paid for their funerals. It's a tricky business."

"Do you have lucid dreams? How do you do it?

I've had quite a few dreams in which I was aware that I was dreaming. In the past what I've done is to suggest to myself before I went to sleep that I would be aware that I was dreaming while it happened. I did this nightly and after a while it began to work! Another technique I've used is to ask myself at various times during the day, ""Am I dreaming? How do I know?"" and consider how my experience was different from a dream. I found that I would begin to ask myself this during dreams."

Why do we allow this to go on?

"i'm confused!!?
so..lets get this straight...if you stop eating you don't lose weight and u slow down ur matabolism?? or do u actually lose some weight???
Initially you will lose weight, but once you body recognizes that you are not eating, it will go into starvation mode, where it stores every sugar in your body as fat. This fat accumulates, so that the body has energy to burn, just in case you still don't  eat and the body needs energy to help your body function. When in starvation mode, if you do eat even a little bit, you body will store most of the sugars and fats in whatever you ate, and this storing of sugars and fats keeps a steady weight maybe even a weight gain."
"Is thermodynamics a branch of physics?

Yes it is.\n\nWikipedia (see source):  ""Thermodynamics (from the Greek thermos meaning heat and dynamics meaning power) is a branch of physics that studies the effects of changes in temperature, pressure, and volume on physical systems at the macroscopic scale by analyzing the collective motion of their particles using statistics.""\n\nIt is sometimes associated with chemistry (and taught in chemistry classes) because there are important results and laws from thermodynamics that apply to chemical reactions.  But strictly speaking the laws of thermodynamics are not limited to chemical processes, and are not caused by chemical properties.  So it is more generally considered part of physics."

"How can one measure some things  vapor density?

Vapor Pressure\n\n\n\nOne of the physical properties that we can measure for liquids and solids is vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure of the vapor of a liquid or solid in equilibrium with the liquid or solid state. Generally liquids have higher vapor pressures than solids. \n\nYou can look at vapor pressure from a molecular view. Let's say that we have a glass of liquid water. The only molecules of water that have the highest probability of escaping into the vapor phase are the surface molecules. Molecules of water below the surface have forces between the molecules called Intermolecular Forces that are stronger then these forces exert on surface molecules. This is simply because there are more molecules surrounding the interior water molecules than what surround the surface molecules. As a result, water molecules can only escape at the surface. The physical process by which vapor pressure occurs is referred to as evaporation. There are several things that could influence the rate at which liquid molecules become vapor. \n\n\nPolar Nature of the molecules \nIf the molecules are non-polar then there will be weaker intermolecular forces keeping them in the liquid state. Non-polar substances like hydrocarbons have weaker forces between them and therefore their vapor pressures are characteristically higher than polar substances. Polar substances have dipolar molecules with positive and negative ends to the molecules. The intermolecular forces are much stronger and the liquid molecules are kept in the liquid state easier. Polar substances tend to have lower vapor pressures at a given temperature. The rate of evaporation for non-polar molecules would be generally greater than polar molecules in comparison. \n\n\nSurface area \nSurface area would play apart since evaporation is a ""surface phenomena"" as was mentioned above. It stands to reason that if we increase the surface area of a liquid that we will increase the number of surface molecules and therefore more molecules will be able to escape into the vapor state. This is why when we want to evaporate something we place it on a watch glass or in a beaker and not in a test tube where the surface area is much more restricted. Increasing the surface area will increase the rate at which something will evaporate. Unlike the polar nature of the molecules, changing the surface area does not affect the vapor pressure itself. \n\n\nTemperature \nTemperature increases increase the available Kinetic Energy present. The more energy that the surface molecules can absorb the faster they will be able to overcome the intermolecular forces acting upon them and the sooner they will become vapor. Increasing the temperature increases the rate at which something will evaporate. Like the polar nature of molecules it also affects the vapor pressure. Increasing the temperature of a liquid increases the vapor pressure logarithmically. \n\n\nThe concentration of vapor molecules above the liquid \nIncreasing the number of vapor molecules above the liquid will leave less room for further vapor molecules. This has a depressing effect on the rate at which the liquid evaporates. Reducing the concentration of vapor molecules at the surface will increase the rate. That is why we turn on a ventilation fan under the vent hood of a lab when we wish to evaporate something quickly. In addition, clothes hanging on a clothes line dry faster on a windy day then on a still day. \n\n\nThe Vapor Pressure of a liquid at a given temperature is a characteristic property of that liquid. It can be measured by using a pressure instrument known as a manometer. Vapor pressure of a liquid is intimately connected to another physical property known as boiling point, but that will be another topic for discussion. \n\nVapor Pressures are influenced by Temperature logarithmically and this relationship is defined with the Clausius Clapyron Equation: \n\nLog P2 / P1 = Delta H vaporization [ 1 / T1 - 1/T2"
"Zabubabark and the persecution of wasps, a good idea?
An obvious and perhaps fundamental problem to our religion is the possible persecution against wasps. It is stated that we do not like them and this is true. However we must not ""kill"" wasps, that just makes is incredibly weak and leads to nightmares. So how can we even the burden of hate and guilt? One suggestion was the Zabubabark, in which we transport the collective natural destroyers of wasps to their target and let nature take its way. We need answers and ideas.

same only wanna ask about weight loose plz tell me how i can i reduce i have tried several times and i have succeded also i cant maintain i started eating as always
You just have to decide that you want to lose weight.  Will power comes from within.  You didn't say how old you are.  One step at a time might help and eating 6 small meals instead of 3 large ones.  Snack on healthy snacks, like raw veggies or fruits.  Remember, it took time to put extra weight on, and will take time to take it off."
"What are the best nutritional supplements available?

It all depends on you. If your watching your weight, or if you have health conditions, or if you have to watch your sugar intake, etc. If your looking for a nutritional supplement alone, then there's a lot of them out there that are good, like Ensure, if your a little older, or I like Slimfast too. If your looking for a dietary supplement, something that is good for your immune system and helps you not get sick, try Elderberry. It's a natural herb, better than Echinecea, and it works really fast if you feel a cold or the flu coming on. You can buy it at any vitamin store. Another helpful thing, protein shakes/bars and good if you want to lose weight and gain muscle but you have to work out with these things because they will bulk you up! :) Hope that all helps you out. Sorry if I was on the wrong path here."

"Where does the surrounding light go, when you turn the switch off in a closed room with no exit or windows?
I am speaking of the light that is ""floating"" in the air surrounding you. Where does it go when the source is shut off?
All of the light ""floating"" in the air is composed of photons which are eventually absorbed by the atoms in the room and converted into heat.  This heat eventually dissapates through the walls and radiates outside the room.  Of course, there is an imperceptable delay between when the last photon leaves the light and is absorbed by the walls, but this happens at the speed of light and can't be seen by you or me."

I don't smoke, I think its gross...but I've always wondered. How come when people smoke, sometimes they blow it out their mouth, sometimes it comes out their nose? I mean I know how it happens, but why do smokers do it?
becasue when you breathe outwards with your mouth closed the smoke comes out your nose and when you exhale with your mouth open it'll usually come out the mouth unless your mouth is open but you exhale through your nose. Basically the smoke comes out where ever the air is leaving your body"

"can restrictive fibrosis of the lungs be life threatening? what conditions are related?
my father just had a chest x-ray done last wk. he went to peru. this is an extremely high elevation. he came back w/ almost pneumonia like symptoms. i am very scared. i know that self diagnosing on the internet is not a good thing to do at times. he has an appt. w a pulminary specialist at the end of the month. can anybody give me some advice please? my father is my hero in many ways, and i would be crushed to lose him. please no mean replys.
restrictive fibrosis -- hmm... has your father been exposed to fire and heat  (is he a fireman?) because i know pulmonary fibrosis is like ""scarring of the lung"" -- the lungs has been exposed to an environment that has ""burned"" it (one example) and the lungs created new scar tissues, attempting to repair it. the only down side is, the reason why it's called restrictive, is because it prevents your dad from taking deep breaths. these scar tissues are pretty strong -- they're not elastic. that's why... and when you don't take deep breaths, this could increase your risk of getting pneumonia.\n\nthis kind of disease is irreversible (meaning we cannot cure it) but there are therapeutic ways to help him breath effectively and prevent pneumonia. most probably, your father's doctor will teach him these therapeutic measures to help him. so don't worry. the only thing you need to worry about is, he has to do these things religiously, and also he has to take good care of his health because many complications may arise, if he doesn't.\n\nwhew! it's been a while since i last studied this. i apologize if i wasn't any helpful. i need to dust off those books again and start reading."
"Coefficient of Restitution-Formula For n bounces.?
Hi  show me the derivation for finding the height of the nth bounce of an object using the coefficient of restitution.\nThanks
If the object starts out at a height h0 and is dropped, then all the potential energy is converted in kinetic energy\n\nm*g*h0 = 0.5*m*v0^2\n\nso that at impact the object is moving at a speed v0\n\nv0 = sqrt(2*g*h0)\n\nAfter bouncing off the surface the object is moving with a speed v1\n\nv1 = e*v0\n\nwhere e is the coefficient of restitution. In a purely elastic collision e=1, but in the real world e<1. Using the conservation of energy again\n\n0.5*m*v1^2 = m*g*h1\n\nwhere h1 is the new height to which the object bounces.\n\nh1 = 0.5*e^2*v0^2/g\n\nAt moment of next impact the object is moving at speed v1, but rebounds at speed v2\n\nv2 = e*v1 = e^2*v0\n\nThe height h2 is then\n\nh2 = 0.5*e^2*v1^2/g = 0.5*e^4*v0^2/g\n\nThis continues for however many bounces you wish. Recall now that v0^2 = 2*g*h0 so that the heights are\n\nh0 = e^0*h0 (shown only for consistency with the following)\nh1 = e^2*h0\nh2 = e^4*h0\nh3 = e^6*h0\n...\nhn = e^(2n)*h0"

Actually any one can do it. If you owe a business money and you decide not to pay it most businesses instead of going to court will give it to a collection agency which intern sends you a nice letter and then if you dont pay it they put a nice spot on your credit.

"is there any real solution for penis enlargement? is it effective and really works? i need a true solution?

Use a medical traction device such as the Andro Penis - it is a medical traction device that uses traction to permanently expand the blood-carrying chambers (the largest being the corpus cavernosa) of the penis. This method is highly effective, being effective in 98% of men in studies.\n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains in length and some girth gains as well. The flaccid gains appear first. If you want additional girth gains than what you get with the Andro, you should use a PowerJelq device for 10-15 minutes a day to supplement it.\n\nI've gained permanently 1.75"" length and 1"" girth since June 2005 through the use of the Andro Penis and (very occassionally) PowerJelq for exercises. I'm very pleased with these results. Try it, and you will be happy to see serious gains after 3-6 months usage.\n\nCommon issues with the product are 1) how to make wearing the product more comfortable 2) how to effectively secure the product 3) when and how long you can use the product. Generally the answers to these 3 issues are: 1) use the padding band over your glans before putting it in the silicone band 2) use some padding or other material to prevent slippage of the glans out of the band 3) have a rest period every 2 hours at least, and massage yourself during that time to ensure good blood flow. Don't use the device while sleeping (you won't have the required massage break every 2 hrs). The manual that comes with the Andro has adequate information on what to do and what not to do.\n\nSide note about purchasing this item: you can usually buy this item on Ebay for about 1/2 the cost of other websites. Make sure to shop for the best price. I paid $150. My package included pills, but I never used the pills and I've still gained 1.75"" length, 1"" girth in 7 months.\n\nSee the link for a study on men using the device. It indicates an average growth per month of around .47 cm in length. Also, after six months, a ""median minimum gain"" of 2.8 cm.\n\nAlso, I believe it is helpful to perform PC (kegel) exercises to strengthen the PC muscle. You will be enlarging yourself quite significantly and you want to maintain very strong erection strength and stamina which are controlled by the pubococcyl muscle.\n\nIf you need more information let me know."

"what is best alternative medicine for coughing  for 22 months old baby?
I am realy sick of giving him tylenol 5 days a week.he is in Day care and every week picks up new virus.
So young, I wouldn't apply anything directly on the baby but use a humidifier/aromatherepy diffuser. Use no more than 5 drops of PURE lavender oil and maybe a drop or 2 of chamomile.You can also use rose oil.Make sure it's PURE.Also, you can use 1 drop of any of the following PURE oils with the lavender or chamomile:eucalyptus,rosemary (be very careful with this one though-very strong!!!use a half a drop!), lemon(use half a drop!!!!), orange. It might be good for you to purchase a potpourri sachet in lavender. Again PLEASE make sure that it's NATURAL and place it in smelling distace to the crib but out of reaching distance. The color turquoise around the baby in decor or clothing will awaken the thymus chakra responsible for proper immune functioning. Also, gently using your finger to tap on his thymus gland for  a minute, will strengthen his immunities. Good luck!Please give him a kiss for me . . .but don't get sick - ok? P.s.

ok. well. the um first one is 15c^4 - 26c^2 - 21. if you let x = c^2, then you can rewrite this equation as \n15x^2 - 26x - 21. and to factor this, you find 2 numbers that multiply to 15*-21   and add to -26. so it is -35 and 9.\nwhich means you can rewrite 15x^2 - 35x + 9x - 21\n= 5x (3x-7) + 3(3x-7)\n= (5x+3)(3x-7)\n\nand since x = c^2, you can rewrite this as \n(5c^2 + 3)(3c^2 - 7) and if you multiply that out, youll see you get your first equation.\n\n2. so same thing here. put x= h^2.\n12x^2 - 29x - 8\nthe numbers in this case, 12*(-8) = -96. so 3*(-32) = -96. so the 2 numbers are -32 and 3.\n\n12x^2 - 32x + 3x - 8\n4x (3x-8) + 1(3x-8)\n(4x-1)(3x-8)\n(4h^2 -1) (3h^2-8)\nso there.\n\n3. in this case, the highest is squared, which you know how to do.\n2x^2 + 7x + 6\n2*6 = 12. and um 4*3=12, 4+3=7. so the numbers are 4 and 3\n\n2x^2 + 4x + 3x + 6\n2x (x+2) + 3(x+2)\n(2x+3)(x+2)\n\nso there. hpe that helps. laterz"

stop taking xenadrine -- is it more important to lose weight than have a heart problem? whatever they say about xenadrine is false advertising -- it does contain ephedra. it has been prhobited by the food and drug administration, but is still sold in some stores, even reputable ones because of it's popularity. it is effective i guess, but the side effects are not pretty -- people are in denial when it comes to this kind of drugs. they don't care about the side effects, as long as the drug is working. \n\ni bet these symptoms you listed above started when you started taking xenadrine. so i advise you to immediately stop that medication. i bought one of those trimspa years ago, never took one of them because i did a research on it -- not good. please try to remember, there are NO shortcut pills to a healthier body -- lifestyle change is a lot more safer and successful. \n\nthese kind of pills make you hyperactive -- makes the heart beat faster also -- and this will cause cardiac irregularites eventually. \n\nif you think xenadrine is so safe -- ever wondered why doctors DON'T prescribe it to patients? you are way too young to have heart problems (unless you've had it since you were a baby -- but still xenadrine is still contraindicated). trust me -- it's xenadrine that's causing your heart irregularities.\n\ngood think you were just playing bowling -- if you took this drug and started running -- don't know where you'll be right now. somebody has died from it too -- that's why ephedra is considered illegal."

"What does unvested mean?
In this context: \n\n""However, Cheney continued to\nhold 140,000 shares of unvested stock that is worth $7.6 million at 2005 stock\nprices.This stock could not be managed or sold by anyone until 2002, because\nit was unvested; thus it could not be put into a blind trust.Therefore Cheney\nhad a direct financial interest in the value of Halliburton's stock and the financial\nprofitability of Halliburton the first two years of his vice presidency.\nCheney also owns great amounts of Halliburton stock that are safely tucked\naway in a blind trust for post-vice presidency personal use.""\n\nDawn Rothe, ""Iraq and Halliburton""
""Vested"" means ownership, therefore, ""unvested"" refers to the shares held in his name, but not owned by him. Most companies have a vesting schedule - sometimes a graded scale (e.g., % increases over 5-7 years) or sometimes a cliff (eg, 0% vested until 5 years, then 100% vested)."

"What should I invest my money in?
If you have $50,000 , what would you invest it in?\n\n------------------------------...\nhttp://www.bestcreditrates.net
It depends on how risky you want to be.  Do you feel confident about your ability to play the stock market?  If so you could take a chunk and invest it there.  If you are more conservative then I would suggest an ING account or a CD with the highest return of investment.  Usually a 12 month CD will carry a higher return but you cannot access this money easily without paying a penalty.  So if you want a good return with access to your money either a money market or an ING account would probably work best.  Happy investing!"

"can any jehovah's witnesses explain what is wrong with birthdays?
I am myself a jehovahs witness and have asked the question again and again. what exactly is wrong with birthdays. I understand why we dont celebrate christmas or haloween or any of the other holidays but i do not understand why celebrating a new time in your life is so wrong. And if birthdays are against the religion than why arent anniversaries or any other event like it against are religion. if anyone can explain it to me i would appreciate it.
:})\n""mcrgirl5851"" I feel sorry for you, the truth is that Jehovah's witness are no kinder, or more understanding to its own members, who ask questions, than Islam was to the young man who converted to Christianity recently.\n I'm not JW but have no problem with their disdain of celebrated days, if that is what you believe, as long as obedience doesn't become so strict that you begin to depend on your works as a means of earning salvation.\n  The problem you have experienced is not uncommon. Many pseudo-Christian religions use authoritarian control to keep newer and younger constituents in line. Free thought and spiritual guidance are often discouraged in favor of a supposedly more authoritive source like the priesthood or the organization or the pope or what ever.\n A normal part of maturation is questioning those things we accepted without question as children. We begin to become responsible for our own belief system. Our belief in a higher power must be our own or it isn't’t our belief , A religion which is not our will not save us.\nLet me encourage you to remain obedient to your parents, to others with more knowledge but not to allow your inquisitive mind to be silenced. G-d is able to defend himself. He dosen't’t mind questions. Some of the greatest characters in scripture went Through periods of questioning. G-d gave you that fertile mind use it. But use it to his glory. Be a witness of the true Jehovah.\n\nBless you.\n\n\nBy the way bronxgirl, you don't want her to celebrate his death either.

"What are some ways a single mother on an average income purchase a house?

The first step is to talk to a mortage broker or banker.  You will need to be able to provide proof of income, and they will run a credit report.  If you're debt-to-income ratio is steady, and you have good credit, you may be able to do 100% financing with 6% seller assist.  The interest rate may be higher than you want (like 9-11%) Your purchase price may be low, and you may need to buy a ""fixer upper"", which takes some dedication and a good real estate agent. You may be able to do an FHA mortgage, which will get you a lower interest rate. \n\nThe other option (which takes a lot of patience and self-control) is to save like there's no tomorrow.  Cut up the credit cards, pay off some debts to get your income-to-debt ratio lower (generally you can't have more than 33% of your income go towards debt), and open a savings account, even if it only has $100 in it for now. If you're able to put even 5% down, in addition to about $4000 in closing costs, you will be able to get a much better rate, which will lower your monthly payment.  It takes longer, yes, and it won't be easy, but you will ultimately be able to afford more house.\n  \nThe ""unconventional"" route would be to see if you can find an owner-financed home for sale.  Basically, this means the seller is willing to carry the mortgage for you, and you can negotiate if you get the deed upfront or after the home is paid off.  There are a few risks associated with this, so be sure to work with an experienced agent or attorney if you are able to find a willing seller. \n\nThe housing authority (HUD), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc. may have some additional resources for you, so you may want to check out their websites first.  They will at least be able to provide participating lenders and give you a good place to start. \n\nwww.hud.gov\nhttp://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml\nhttp://www.freddiemac.com/\n\nBest of luck to you and most importantly, don't give up hope!!!

"in the holocoust  did  some medical experiments worked?
and if they did can you name the Experiments ?
Sort of?  There was one experiment where they were trying to see how you could keep someone alive after they'd been in freezing cold water up to their neck.  After the victims kept dying from being in freezing cold water, they learned that if you kept something over the back of your neck to keep it warmer, you could survive longer.\n\nAlso, they would take the victims out of the cold water, but they would die quickly, and the Nazis couldn't find a way to keep them from dying.  After the Holocaust, the scientific community learned the reason for this was because, when you take someone out of cold water, you have to keep them still, keep them dry, and warm them slowly.  Basically, be kind.  Of course, the Nazis treated their subjects so poorly, they couldn't have possibly saved them."
"What can help me grow taller?
What foods can help me grow taller and what else can I do to grow taller?
I guess it depends on how old you are, usually growth continues until about age 17-21. There are no foods that help you grow, however a Calcium supplement does promote bone strength, so getting a good amount of Calcium in your diet is important and also weight bearing exercise stimulates bone growth too."
"What is nonlinear optics?
Specifically, what are higher order effects in nonlinear optics?
Most commonly observed optical effects (refraction, diffraction, reflection) are linear: if you double the amount of light at the source, the results observed also double. Similarly for decreases in the amount of light. There is a linear relationship between source intensity and observed intensity as the light passes through the optics (lens, mirrors, etc.).\n\nNon-linear optics don't behave that way at all. As the light intensity increases, the medium through which the light propagates (the optics) is stressed by the electrical or magnetic field (or both) of the light wave. This stress changes some physical property of the medium, such as its polarization or its refractive index, as a function of the light intensity. The result is a non-linear response of the material to the electromagnetic field of the light.\n\nThis can have some interesting consequences, such as the generation of harmonics of the original wavelength. It is this non-linear mechanism that allows a strong infrared, or near infrared, laser to be be frequency doubled or frequency tripled to produce coherent light at visible or ultraviolet wavelengths."
"What is the best thickening agent?

It depends on what application you are talking about. If you're making gravy, the best thickening agent is flour. If you're making Jello, the best thickening agent is gelatin. Polyethylene glycol of differing molecular weights is used to increase the viscosity of some solutions (do not eat). All of these agents can be thought of as like sponges that soak up solvent. A good thickening agent would be a polymer that interacts with the solvent of interest."
"what does st. patrick's day mean?

St. Patrick is the patron Saint of Ireland. He was a Catholic missionary who was the first to truly challenge the traditional Pagan religions of Ireland. He was captured as a slave when he was 16 and sent to Ireland. After six years he escaped and returned to Britian. It was here that he became a member of the clergy. After a message from God where he was told to spread the Faith to the Irish pagans he began to study how to be a successful missionary. He arrived in Ireland in 432 or 433 and quickly challenged the status quo including preforming Christian rituals. He preached and spread the gospel for 40 years before he died. His mission was successful as by the time of his death the majority of Irish has converted to Catholicism. So St. Patrick's Day was born as a religious celebration of him, but has evolved into a celebration of all things Irish and the impact the Irish have had around the world."

SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is a project which has been running for the last 50 years or so, analyzing radio signals received on Earth from space.  There are various institutes which have been set up, and which work together to do so.  A lot of the founding work put into this was done by Frank Drake, simply to check for extra-terrestrial intelligence.  The aim of the project contains as such, attempting to decode radio signals received at Earth.  If you want to participate, you could check out the SETI@HOME site (http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) which runs on your PC when you are not busy with it, and attempts to decode signals received and sends the results back to them.\n\nAlthough at least one highly interesting signal has been received (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow%21_signal), it has never been repeated and most scientists believe this was probably a fluke."

Cervical cryosurgery or cryotherapy is a gynecological treatment that freezes a section of the cervix. Cryosurgery of the cervix is most often done to destroy abnormal cervical cells that show changes that may lead to cancer. These changes are called precancerous cells. Your gynecologist will probably use the term cervical dysplasia. \nCryosurgery is done only after a colposcopy confirms the presence of abnormal cervical cells. Cyrotherapy is also used for the treatment of cervicitis or inflammation of the cervix. Cryosurgery is not a treatment for cervical cancer."

"do we see a different side of the sun everyday? since we move around it?

Our motion around the sun is only one revolution per year, so that doesn't show much change on a daily basis. The rotation of the sun brings new details into view. The speed of rotation varies with position on the sun - things at the sun's equator go around once every 25 days, but it's only spinning once every 36 days at its poles. \n\nSome features on the sun, solar flares for example, come and go in a few hours or less, but sunspots tend to persist for many days, long enough  so you can watch them as the sun's rotation caries them around."

Okay, I'm sure these questions get asked all the time, but...\n\nAlso, I am posting this in the women's section, because I would value a female perspective on this.\n\nMy penis is average in length but Ive been told is on the thick side. It measures 6"" around (girth?) - is that good?\n\nIm not that hung up on it, but I want to know that I am pleasing whoever Im with (I dont sleep around, but I am unnattached and date).\n\nIs length or width more important? No goofy answers please, I'm serious about this.
That is just so small as to be unbelievable.  I would start taking the penis growth pills if I were you."
"a problem about ""Inductor"" and ""Capacitor""?
it is said that ""capacitors block DC current and let AC current pass, while inductors do the opposite."".i wonder the reason?pls,
Think about the simpliest capacitor. It is clear that two metal plates that don't touch won't let a DC current pass, right? But the spacing is very thin so that the plate's charges can effect one another. When you first put current (even DC) to a discharged capacitor, it charges up and for a brief time it does conduct current. How long? Well it will charge to 2/3 of the total voltage in RC seconds (where R is the resistance of the circuit). So when AC current is ""fast"" enough, the cap is constantly in a charge/discharge state and current flows. The effective resistance (reactance) of the cap is 1/(2*pi*F*C). So the resistance goes down as the capacitance and the frequency rises.\n\nThe inductor, on the other hand is just a coil of wire. Again, it is easy to imagine that it will conduct DC. But when you first apply current (even DC) to a coil, the magnetic field will interact with the coil and produce an opposing voltage. This only occurs when the magnetic field is forming or collapsing (remember, magnetic fields that do not move do not produce electricity). So right when you change the current, the inductor will ""resist"" the change, but if the current doesn't change, it is just a wire. The reactance of a coil is 2*pi*F*L, so the resistance increases with frequency and inductance.\n\nNow, combining inductors and capacitors is another interesting subject, but you didn't ask about that...."
"I want to loose inches around my: butt, thighs, stomach and waist. How do i do this? does pilates work or wat?

Pilates work as long as they are done consistently and with proper amounts of nutritional intake.  The same can be said of most types of exercise.\n\nI've been helping people stay healthy for a more than 20 years, I teach ongoing nutrition, cooking, and health classes and I can tell you that losing weight requires a combination of both exercise and caloric restriction but with a proper nutrition balance. Believe me when I tell you that you don't necessarily want to lose weight 'fast.' What you should be looking for is steady, functional fat loss (i.e., weight that stays off once it is gone).\n\nOnce you read what I'll write below, if you have any specific questions I'll try to answer them either on the FAQ side of my personal website or on my blog -- I won't use your name in either case if you don't want me to. You might also want to visit the FAQ section because it may have some helpful hints for you. It's located at: http://www.betterlifetoday.com/faqblt.ht...\n\nIf you want to lose weight in a healthy manner, keep the following in mind:\n\n1) Check with your physician to be certain that you are physically able to reduce your calories and increase your exercise habits safely.\n\n2) Make certain that the calories you are eating are as balanced as possible. When I say 'balanced' I don't mean that they have to all equal the same number of calories. Instead, finding out how much protein, carbs, and fats your body needs on a daily basis (this will vary depending on your metabolic type but a decent example is the 40-40-20 plan -- 40% of calories from protein, 40% from unrefined carbs, and 20% from fats and oils) can really help keep your energy levels high all day long. \n\nThe #1 reason my clients tell me that they've stopped dieting or exercising in the past is because of low energy ebbs. Splitting the amount of calories you can have per day into 5 - 6 smaller meals will help tremendously (this keeps your body fueled and ready to go and you also know that your next meal is only a couple of hours away).\n\nKnowing what your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is will certainly help you determine how to be calorie conscious. Again, you can find out about BMR and RMR on my site -- it's just too much information to post here. Also remember that you may or may not need supplements to help things along.\n\n3) While exercising (before, during, and after) be sure to consume enough water. The key is not to be 'thirsty' (overtly) during this time of exercise.\n\n4) Adding weight bearing exercise (i.e., lifting weights) will help to tone your body and the thermogenic (fat burning) effect will last long after you've stopped working out -- even if your workout is simply walking).\n\n5) Remember that you'll probably hit plateaus (times when you'll stop losing weight) several times during your weight loss progress. This is completely normal and is only temporary but it can last for a couple of weeks at a time. It is very important to remember that even if your scale isn't showing progress, your entire body is being positively effected by your efforts.\n\n6) Measure different parts of your body (neck, upper arms, lower arms, chest, abs, waist, belly, butt, thighs, etc.) and do it accurately. Write these measurements down and check them once every 2 weeks. This will help you remember that your body is 'reducing' all over -- not just in one particular area. If you're weight training you may actually notice a slight increase in some areas of your body (don't worry -- if you're a woman you won't start looking like a bodybuilder).\n\nAgain, there's no such thing as 'spot-reducing' (for things like 'belly fat' or 'thigh fat' etc) unless you're talking about surgery. Fat is burned off of the body from all over the body. The reason it seems as though some people can 'spot-reduce' is because, in general, the ankles, thig"

"Is there 'dark matter' that is really not matter in the universe?

Dark matter is actual matter in the sense that it has mass.  But it doesn't seem to absorb or reflect electromagnetic radiation, hence the term 'dark' matter.

"Why are mirrages caused in the desert?
Explain stating the physical phenomena
A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon. The kind most commonly seen (inferior mirage - where the inverted image lies below the upright one) is produced by the refraction of light when it passes into a layer of warm air lying close to a heated ground surface. In deserts, mirages may give the appearance of a lake or other large body of water in the distance; as the previous writer stated, this is actually an image of the sky being refracted back up from the warm air lying over the sand."
"Why can't I just be happy?
Today, I was walking down Michigan Ave. in Chicago and this guy just punched me in the face for no reason. I got so scared that I flatulated and soiled my pants. I just took the punch and walked away sad. I don't really know whats wrong. Fecal matter was oozing down my running shorts I was wearing at the time and people either held their noses while I walked by or they cursed at me. When I got home with brown legs my girlfriend just laughed at me and called me a loser. Oh well, she's cheating on me anyways. Nothing I can do about it. My nose really hurts though, I think it could be broken. Im too depressed to go to the doctor. My girlfriend is probably banging him anyways. God, she get's around.  Oh well, I have no plans, maybe i'll try and fix my nose. I have no plans tonight. God bless everyone.

I hope the best for you, and you have to remember that Tomorrow WILL BE BETTER!!! It has to be. You should think about dumping that skank of a ho girlfriend You deserve a lot better and you know that you do, and you should think about going to the doctor and if you need a little help there is no shame in it, I too have been cheated on and it is the worse and most horrible feeling, I had to go on Zoloft, but the good thing is that it helps and once you can come out of the fog of depression you can see more clearly. You deserve better! Get you a plan of action and figure out what you need to do, Evalute every aspect of your life... is it time for a lifestyle change... change of job, if at all possible kick her out because adding a move on top of everything is going to be more stressful, and what a B*tch to laugh at you after what you went through, find a safer jogging route... and did you ever think that maybe that guy punched you because she is banging him? I kinda wondered that when I read, because that is just too strange that a guy would punch you for NO reason, and then she laughed on top of it... Go out with some friends or family, if you don't have any... make some, you need to surround yourself with loving and caring people. Best of luck to you, and I hope that your nose isn't broken a nice guy like you doesn't deserve that. *Another big hug and maybe a  little kiss on the cheek*"

I have a 16 yr old son that doesn't want to attend church, I don't want to push too much, for it will send him in the other direction.  My feeling is if I walk my walk and let him see it, then he will learn from me in that manner.  What would you do in this situation?
I'm 21, my father's a priest, and I just started reattending church. I haven't gone to church since I was 13. My parents of course didn't agree with that at first, but my father realized that I had to find God in my own time. He knew I would come around, and he was good enough to be patient. Sadly he had to wait 8 years, but at least I got there. And my belief is that eventually your son will too. But he's 16 and right now everyone around him is very influencial, friends, family, television, video games. I think the only thing you can do is just pray for him every day and have the faith in God that God will bring him back to church.  Plus you do know that just because he doesn't attend church, doesn't mean that he rejects God. Because even though I didn't go to church all those years, I knew he was still there for me, and I still believed in him and always will. Hope this long response helps. God Bless."

"can u help my mom?
she woke up this morning and her eyes were all gooey and red and puffy. it hurts and she can hardly keep her eyes open. she doesn't have a fever but she has a cold. she tried putting a wet washcloth on them but it didn't really help. any ideas?? should we call a doctor?
You should call a doctor, but it sounds like conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye.  It usually only pops up in one eye, but sometimes it will infect both at the same time.  For some reason I have gotten pink eye almost every year for the past 5 years in the summer to fall season change.  She could also have develped an allergy.  If she keeps a warm washcloth on them it should help, but definitely get to a doctor as they will prescribe eye drops that should clear it up in a few days.  Another tip to help so she does not get reinfected-wash towels, sheets, blankets or anything that her eyes, face or hands come in contact with daily.  The germs will stay on soft surfaces like that.  Good Luck!"

"Is intelligence an evolutionary fluke?
I mean really, what purpose does it actually serve?
Intelligence is not a fluke, but there is truly some debate as to whether it is the product of evolution or not.  Take any primate, for example.  They all have relatively sophistated brains, and the work with them suggests a capacity for intelligent behavior.  Still, intelligent behavior and actual intelligence are two different things.  No simian has ever learned to sign on its own, or develop a method of mathmetics, or designed a house.  It can be shown these things, and even taught the basics of them, but its never done these things on its own.  And there are other animals out there with brains as large as ours or larger, like a dolphin, yet none of these animals have ever created anything (so far as we know, anyway).\nWhy is it that all other animals on Earth must adapt in order to survive but not human beings?  We don't adapt to our environment; we don't grow thick fur when we get cold, or hibernate for the winter.  We make our environment adapt to us.  We reshape our environment to make it more conducive to our survival, like making thick warm clothing and building a fire.  That's creative intelligence, and there's no evidence that it's present in any other species on Earth.  Cognitive intelligence, yes, but creative intelligence, no.  So I don't see how it could've been ""evolved"" into us, when it seems nature hasn't put that charectaristic in any other species."

What's your honest opinion?
Banning gay marriage is bigotry. It's like the 'Jim Crow' laws of the 1950's in America where a black and a white were not allowed to marry. By banning gay marriage, lawmakers are essentially encouraging gays to not settle down and to continue to date around, which can spread HIV. Gay couples who get married might even want to raise children and would be willing to adopt unwanted children.

Can Christian show me where I can find words in the Bible that Jesus say ""I am God,"" or ""I am equal to God,"" or ""Worship me""\n\nIf Christian can shows me, it will be easy for me to accept Jesus as my GOD.\nPlease help me...
Well, I don't think it says anything like ""I am God"", but in Romans 12:1, it says that you should ""offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God -this is your spiritual act of worship."" In a way, that is telling you to worship him."
"where did techno come from ?
where did the techno revolution start ?
It started in 1979. It started out as house music for dance clubs. Disco was on the way out and computers were on the way in. Techno evolved over the past 27 odd years. Techno is mostly computerized music that can be done with a synthesizer and voice box. Highly popular with my GLBT community!"
"I just don't know?
I think that I am bi-curious, but I don't know for sure if I am bisexual because I have never had any homosexual experiences. I mean, girls turn me on and all, but I think I'd like to kiss a guy, just to know for sure. What should I do and how should I go about doing it?
First off, let's get this straight (no pun intended!)- you DO NOT have to have had sexual experience with either sex in order to be bisexual.  Take it from me, a bisexual virgin of both sexes- it's not about what you do with whom, but what you'd like to do, and with whom.\n\nSince you've given this some thought, you're definitely bicurious; possibly bisexual, although that remains to be seen.  It's perfectly fine to want to 'know for sure', but remember- don't use people as sexual guinea pigs.  People deserve better than that, and if you're going to use someone to test your sexual orientation, that person better know about why you're doing it, and be okay with that.  Honestly, in my opinion, all the gay acts you can do with a man won't cement anything down for you.  I mean, think of it this way- a lot of straight people have their first kiss/first sexual experience with the opposite sex . . . and hate it.  It doesn't mean they aren't straight.  People have bad sex all the time, but it doesn't affect their orientation.  The best way to test these things is with your desire- do you get turned on by men or the thought of men together?  Could you imagine yourself having a sexually satisfying experience with a man in the future?  These are better questions to ask and answer to discover if you are bisexual.\n\nAnd, as always, I believe that if you are with someone you love and are sexually attracted to, the sex will be wonderful.  It's always nice to find that person.\n\nHop that helps and good luck!"
"what is reverse engineering?

The process of analysing an existing system to identify its components and their interrelationships and create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction. Reverse engineering is usually undertaken in order to redesign the system for better maintainability or to produce a copy of a system without access to the design from which it was originally produced. \n\nFor example, one might take the executable code of a computer program, run it to study how it behaved with different input and then attempt to write a program oneself which behaved identically (or better). An integrated circuit might also be reverse engineered by an unscrupulous company wishing to make unlicensed copies of a popular chip. \n\nThis is something that the Americans and Russians were quite keen on when they managed to 'obtain' a piece of each others military equipment during the cold war."

"Does anyone know of a pill or medicine that helps you to lose weight???
I have a weihgt problem, I excercise a lot but I am not loosing any pound and if I do, it is not much, my metabolism is very slow and I wish there was some kind of medicine that could help me to lose some weight.. I am not FAT just big bone, the extra weight makes me look biger!! plus I am a tall lady, PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!
You say you are not fat but having big bones and say you are tall. That means that extra weight is due to your bones. Better do not  take medicines to reduce weight. Since they will have side effects which may at times dangerous and when you stop them you may regain your weight. Dieting and exercise are the best to reduce weight. If it is due to bones do not try to reduce the weight. Go ahead normally."
"What are the benefits of a 1031 exchange in the long run?
I understand you need to hold the funds in an escrow account and you dont get taxed on it.  But eventually if you want to take any funds out you're going to be taxed anyways right?
Although C Brent is essentially correct about 1031 exchanges... I don't think that he answers your question.\n\nA 1031 exchange is a tax deferred exchange.  This means that when you remove your invested capital from real estate... it will be taxed at your capital gains rate (state, fed & recaptured depreciation).\n\nHere is a link to the capital gains calculator on my site:\nhttp://www.1031store.com/resources/1031_capital_gains_calculator.php\n\nIf on the short term side, you decide to take a little cash out (or portion) of your 1031 exchange proceeds, you will be taxed at your capital gains rate on the portion that you decide to not opt into the exchange.  This is called Boot. (like putting cash in your boot).\nHere is a link to the dictionary on my site:\nhttp://www.1031store.com/resources/dictionary.php\n\nWhen speaking about real estate capital gains,  there are some very good long term effects:\n1. (has to be mentioned) you will be realize compounded growth on your deferred capital gain tax.\n\n2. One of the most over looked advantages, is to move capital from a state where the capital gains tax rate is to another state where the capital gains rate is lower.\n\nLT capital gains rates range from 0% - 12% in different states.  A good example is for an owner who sells property in california (believe 9.3% rate) and buys through a 1031 exchange in TX (0% rate).\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.  Even if you sell the TX property after a year, and realize your gain... you do not owe Cali state tax.  That is tax money saved.\n\nSo in the long run... there can be some real advantages.\n\nI'm going to release this site next week.  You'll be able to contact with experts nationwide and find NNN property to purchase.  Feel free to check it out.  By July 1st, you should be able to contact with some experts too.\nhttp://www.1031store.com"

"a company charged me for a service I didn't ask for!?
I recently did business with an online company and ordered a single item, now I am getting a recurring charge on my credit card from that company- they claim it is taken care of but the charge keeps getting on my statements!  Is there some way to get my visa issuer to disregard payment?
Call your card company or bank and dispute the charges immediately, let them know the situation, they will take care of it. Also, contact the company that is making the charges and file a complaint with customer service. Finally, make sure to keep tabs on your credit report to make sure that they do not report you because you refused to pay the fraudulent charges. If it is reported to the credit reporting agencies, make sure you dispute it and send them documentation from your credit card company that you disputed the charges on your card and tried to resolve the situation. That way it will not affect your credit rating, and if it does you have proof that you took steps to close the account and collect the fraudulent charges months before. Be careful because the company could attempt to report you at any time in the next seven years."

"Is it possible for men to be near women and not degrade them?
Or think of them wrongly? Is that even possible?
Sure it is.  There are even very sincere male Goddess-worshipers, who find something sacred and divine in women.  There are also men who, while not going that far, are sincere in their affection for all that is a woman, not just the part she keeps covered by her underwear.  But such gentlemen must be raised by gentlemen, and have ladies worthy of that sort of devotion modeled for them in their mothers, sisters, aunts, cousins.  \n\nJust as obnoxious, overbearing and even violent men have often learned that from their fathers, grandfathers and uncles, noble gentlemen learn from their male relatives.

"How do I go about finding a doctor for my neck problem?
I was in an accident over 3 months ago and need to see some kind of doctor again (I went right after to get checked at an urgent care, and have x-rays, but the pain continues). Since the accident was not my fault, I can go anywhere for treatment and it's covered. \n\nI don't know where to begin...should I see a specialist of some kind?? A chiropractor?? My pain involves radiating pain and some minor tingling in the arms. Do I need to start with a regular doctor and be referred to a specialist? I haven't dealt much with doctors in general in my life, so i'm not sure how it works.
Try to find a very good Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) who does OMM--osteopathic manipulative medicine and who also does cranial osteopathy. A good one is worth their weight in gold! These doctors get a very rigourous training. Some are board certified in surgery, but  that should be an absolute LAST RESORT for any case. Osteopathic physicians can write out prescriptions for medications, and tests--X-rays, MRIs, etc. Many of them specialize in areas such as cardiology, gastro-intestinal disorders, etc. You want the person who still practices the science and art of manual manipulation--which, unfortunately is much rarer these days.\n\nALSO--there is a wonderful, but little known therapy that was developed by a British osteopath--Dr. Robert Boyd, called Bio-Cranial Therapy. The technique takes literally about 1-2 minutes. Only about 200 practitioners are available in the U.S. and many of them are chiropractors. The technique really is very helpful--to the entire body, not just the head/neck area.\n\nIf you go to a chiropractor, try to locate one that practices ""Network Chiropractic."" This is a technique that utilizes very gentle action in that it allows your body to make its own adjustment.\n\nOther modaltiies that may be of benefit: Medical massage therapy, deep tissue massage, craniosacral therapy, Feldenkrais Method, Alexander Technique, accupuncture, myofascial release.\n\nYou can apply a homeopathic cream/gel to the affected area of pain--it's called Traumeel (it comes in cream and a gel--the gel absorbs faster and is less greasy). It's a natural anti-inflammatory and acts to heal the tissue. Just follow the directions. A good health food store or nutritional pharmacy will carry it or you could probably find it online.\n  \nAlso-- if there is little or no more inflammation and you are suffering from stiffness--you may want to try a warm castor oil pack. A good health food store or nutritional pharmacy will have the castor oil (avoid a commercial grade, cheap oil, as it may contain toxins) and a flannel pack. Soak the flannel pack in the oil , place in a plastic bag and apply heat over the area for 20-25 minutes. The castor oil will have a very healing effect on the tissues. Do this daily--just before you go to sleep is a good time.\n\nAbout doctors and health care practitioners. It is very important that you feel comfortable and have confidence in the person you are seeing. Your practitioner should give you their full attention and not rush through the appointment. You have a right to be treated with respect, dignity and compassion. It's a good idea to write down a brief history of your situation and any questions you may have before your initial consultation. Get 2 copies (one for your first visit, and one for yourself to keep at home) of any tests, reports, etc that have been perfomed by an institution or another doctor. You have a right to have a copy of your medical records. It's possible that you may have to pay for copies from a hospital.\n\nListed below are some sources that may be of help.\n\nI know what it is like to be in pain. You WILL HEAL.\n\nBest of luck for a speedy and complete recovery.\n\nA Massage Therapist"

Several infections are included in the term pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), bacteremia (the presence of bacteria in the blood), and meningitis (inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord). Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of illness in young children and causes illness and death in the elderly and in persons with certain underlying medical conditions \n\nWho is at increased risk?\n\nA number of factors help identify those people at high risk for pneumococcal disease. They include: \n\n> 65 years of age or older \n> HIV/AIDS \n> Chronic illness \n> Diabetes \n> Heart disease \n> Lung disease \n> Kidney disease \n> Sickle cell disease \n> Liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) \n> Asplenia (no functioning spleen) \n> Hodgkins disease \n> History of alcoholism \n> Condition associated with an impaired immune system\n> Resident of a chronic care or long-term care institution \n\nIs pneumococcal disease treatable? \n\nThrough the 1980s, penicillin was commonly used to treat pneumococcal infections. Unfortunately, by the 1990s, certain types of pneumococcal bacteria were able to withstand the effects of some antibiotics, including penicillin. As the bacteria continue to develop resistance to additional antibiotics, pneumococcal disease is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.2Pneumococcal disease is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. Several infections are included in the term pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), bacteremia (the presence of bacteria in the blood), and meningitis (inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord). Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of illness in young children and causes illness and death in the elderly and in persons with certain underlying medical conditions.\n\nCan it be prevented? \n\nFortunately, vaccines are available to help prevent pneumococcal disease. Most people need to get pneumococcal vaccine only once. You can get pneumococcal vaccine at any time of the year. Ask your doctor about pneumococcal vaccine today!"

"How long can our eyes see maximum in flat area?

Under ideal conditions such as no smoke, smog, dust, in a flat area, we should be able to see till infinity. Everytime you gaze at the night sky, you see stars millions and billions of miles away. However, you won't be able to see an object, say a golf ball, that is a mile away.  This is because our ability to see things is limited by the resolution of our eyes i.e. how small an object we can discern. Even though bacteria are all around us, we can't see them because they are too small for our eyes to resolve. In the same manner, large objects that are very distant, will also be invisible to us.  However, the earth is not flat, but curved, so the curvature also limits our ability to see distant objects. the higher up you are, the farther away you can see. Even the satellites or astronauts in space can't see more than half the area or circumference of the earth (only one side of it) when they are in space."
"Do voice pitch and frame size have anything to do with dominance in humans?
I read somewhere that height is natural dominance in humans, and it seems to be true.  I'm 14 and 5'9.  If I stand next to someone who's 6'4, I'll feel intimidated.  But the question is, are deep voices or large frames more dominant than small frames and high-pitched voices?  I tend to feel more intimidated by large-framed people (even though I have one aswell) than small-framed people.  I have a pretty deep voice also, and I'm not usually intimidated by people with deep voices.  So there are a few of my questions.\n\nLarge frame.  Dominant or no?\nDeep voice.  Dominant or no?\n\nThanks,\nGerard
Sure. Tall Persons have a natural advantage - just as you explained. Dark voices also suggest dominance. \n\nBut it's the ""right"" combination of height, weight and voice, that makes humans more ""dominating"" than other.\n\n(Imagine a Giant with a high voice - he wont be getting any respect)"

I am afraid to show my teeth, I am afraid of how some people will react and afraid to smile over a joke when I am around all of my friends. What should I do? I do not just have a few crooked teeth.

"Could UFOs/Aliens actually be demons?
I was reading a book ""Lights in the sky and little green men"", makes an excellant case, could you believe UFOs and Aliens are actually demonic beings?
Sure,  The Bible prophesys signs in the heavens The thing about alien life is the supposition of evolution.  It is always that the aliens are insect men or some other animal that evolved into an intelligent being.  Supposing that we did.  If there are aliens, why haven't they made contact, to either conquer us or help us or just sit down and have a cup of coffee.  The truth is that they don't exist and the true apparitions that are seen ( lots of them are explainable)  the true ones are from the spirit world and they defy the natural laws.  Exceed the speed that physical things can move, stop in the air and move left and right.  Angels or Demons, depends on which they are.\nEvolutionists completely ignore the spirit world and believe only in what they see, even the satanists, and wiccans ect on this forum recieve their power from somewhere.  One person who claims to have a demon master, where does the demon come from, you can't deny God there, or are the demons included in evolution.  This is where all of evolution breaks down, the must deny everything that is spiritual and that is difficult.  Everything un-explainable to the evolutionist must be explained purely by science, and it can't be.  There are miracles, and miracle healings and I recognise some are frauds, but we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.."
"Can anyone help??
My friend is getting worried cos hes had aches and pains in his joints for past 6mths that are slowly geting worse, and is feeling very tired. Any suggestions what it may b?? Only serious answers please
Possibly arthritis, but could be lots of things. I and many others on here are not doctors and that is who he needs to see. It could be something really silly and hes worrying for nothing or something that is best to know about sooner rather than later. Tell him to make an appointment with his GP asap."

"Hystiosytosis X and Collapsed lungs?
My brother has had both lungs collapse twice and I was wondering what normally is done in this circumstance. He is 24 and is in the hospital right now (he has been there for over 30 days dealing with a completely incompitant doctor who has no idea what he is dealing judging by the fact they are transferring him to Oakland, CA hosptial today and the head of the hospital cam in and apologized for Doctor's incompitance) and has had 2 proceedures. The first they cut open his lung to attach it to the bone and the second was because the lung wasn't healing they used a sort of adhesive mixed with saleane to make the lung adhere to the bone. Both times the doctor never came back that day to check on him and after the second proceedure his other lung collapsed. So I have two questions ... what can be done to heal him and can the doctor be sued for malpractice or just incompitance?
I thought that you might find this informative to say the least. It will give you a better idea of what you are dealing with, unfortunately I am willing to bet that because of the situation a lawsuit may not even be considered. Sounds as if this is not a ordinary condition such as dealing with your gall bladder or appendix. In cases where they try different things in order to fix a problem that is not common it makes it difficult to prove that there is really any negligence involved. Case in point, my brother in law had lung cancer, they treated him for pneumonia for the year before it was actually diagnosis as cancer. In the mean time it had turned to small cell lung cancer, which basically is a death sentence. He died. Now the thing was is that because he was a smoker and had smoked his whole life he had symptoms of lung disease the cancer shows up on xrays very much like pneumonia and lung disease, where they negligent, well according to the lawyers my sister talked to NO. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't consult with a medical malpractice lawyer just to be sure. The thing that I would do is get a notebook and document everything that has happened so far while it is still fresh in your minds. Have everyone that is involved write down everything they can remember. That will help when you go to talk with the lawyer. Also don't let anyone from the hopital know that you might take action. The lawyer can and will request all information and records involved in his care. Then they have people(experts) who can really tear things apart and decipher what just went on to see if there was medical malpractice.\n\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000068.htm\n\n\nAlso upon reading that article above from the link, a collapsed lung is not an uncommon thing with this condition. That I am sorry to say. Meaning, it can happen spontaniously without any trauma but just because of what is going on. Sounds like you are in for a tough time. I am truly sorry for your family and brother. My prayers will be with you."
"how will global warming and climate change promote the spread of infectious disease?

I think that global warming as  it is describe doesn't exist, so no impact on diseases there.\nI do believe that CO2 is rising and will affect more people with lung problems, but nothing infectious.\n\nClimate change could lead to more infectious diseases as some countries will get colder weather and the immune system doesn't have what it takes yet to fight back flu or cold; some countries will get hotter, and, as well, people will not have the defences against viruses carried by mosquitoes an such.\n\nBut with time, Nature will find a way to re-balance itself.\nWill we give it the time to do so?

"When in the Bible, It says ""Thout shalt not kill"", Does that Mean do not kill animals and bugs too?
This bothers me. Please answer.
Man was given dominion over the animals because he has reason. It is also in his rational nature that his dignity resides. If you think there is a difference between man because he cans think and choose to do right and wrong, then there must be a difference between his dignity as a person and the dignity of animals. Because of his dignity as steward and caretakers of the animals on this earth, he must treat them with respect and reverence but not as his equals because they do not think and do not make choices.\n\nSince the commandments were given by God to all of mankind in order that he might follow his laws and be in community, it is the law between men in society, and therefore it does not apply to animals and bugs. That does not mean the man should wantonly kill animals for no reason, but it does not forbid him from killing them for food or being their are pests to his crops, and well being. For example, mosquitoes bring to man many diseases, it would not be right for him to refrain from killing them if they cause serious illness or death to his family and himself. \n\nI hope that helps."

"I have a tax audit question?
In June of 2002 I was laid off from a major oil and gas company in Houston.  I recieved a prety good severance package from which I took out $10,000 cash put it in an envelop and tucked it away. After spending the rest of 2002 and all of 2003 looking for a stable job and not finding one, in 2004 I decided to pull out the money and try my hand at starting a company doing website development and consulting.  I was up to my neck in credit cards, so decided ""NO MORE CREDIT CARDS"", and went cash and carry, for the most part.  Used my amex, and debit card some but not much.  I needed computer equipment, since the company had always provided one, so went to swap meets, garage sales, etc and bought used equipment.  Most of my receipts are those you get from a supply store.

It's like things happen to you without reason but they lead you to places or things you wouldn't normally do.  You are being guided.  Whatever it is, follow it.

Dude, what is up with all us 20 year olds getting arthritis!?!  I am in my 20s and I too have chronic osteoarthritis in my neck, upper back, hands, and knees.  I use marijuana as a pain reliever because it doesn't incapacitate me as much as something like morphine or vicoden, and also because I can grow it at home.  \n\nMarijuana helps with the pain, but it doesn't do anything to address the root problem of the arthritis, although I am not sure there is much out there that can, except for certain types of surgeries and some people say that Pregnazone helps reduce the advancement of arthritis in the body.  Pretty much all of us youngens who have arthritis early just need to get used to the pain...  :0(  I wish i had a better answer."
"Can a vampire give blood to the Red Cross?

Nope.\n\nThey would have to have not feed for 12 months (Red Cross requires doners to wait that long after a blood transfusion) and not have low blood pressure (which is doubtful if they've been starving themselves for 12 months). \n\nThat's your straight-up traditional vampire, though. If you're talking about homo sapians that engage in the practice of blood sharing, than I would look at the high risk practice rules the Red Cross has.

Islam (Arabic: الإسلام; al-islām listen (help·info)) is a monotheistic religion based upon the Qur'an, which Muslims believe was sent by God through Muhammad, as well as teachings of Muhammad recorded in the Hadith. Followers of Islam, known as Muslims (Arabic: مسلم), believe Muhammad to have been God's (Arabic: Allāh) final prophet.\n\nLike Judaism and Christianity, Islam is considered an Abrahamic religion. [1] With a total of approximately 1.2–1.3 billion adherents , Islam is the second-largest religion in the world.\n\nAlthough Muslims believe Islam dates back to the beginning of time, secular historians place Islam's beginnings during the 7th century in Arabia. Under the leadership of Muhammad and his successors, Islam rapidly spread by religious conversion and military conquest.  Today followers of Islam may be found throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia."

"How do you deal with people who are obsessed with victimising themselves?
Not only do they care about victimising themselves in virtually any situation where they are at fault, they cannot see what fault they have to play in it, nor do they care or realise whatever they do that might have had an impact on others much more than it did themselves!\nHow do we deal with such people when you can't just 'walk away' or 'ignore' them, because they're for example, people you work with, or your housemate, etc.\nIn such situations, no amount of explaining can do anything (like a 5 hour drama I was put through with one of those people and we came right back to the beginning), these people  can't see anything that isn't from their side only.\nThey just can't or won't understand and you go back an entire circle where you started, literally.
I can imagine how complicate it is to have such a person in your environment. Sometime it could be a member of your family, your spouse, and then it is much more complicate. \n\nIf you have such a person in your workplace, just remember one important thing; DO NOT feel sorry. \n\nHe/she is not so poor and weak and self-victimizing persons survive in this world very well. They use their ""victim position"" to manipulate with people, to emotionally and morally blackmail them, what is very exhausting. People in their surrounding usually feel confused, guilty, exhausted. They feel like they cannot help them, cannot do or say the right thing...\n\nDon't let him/her drag you in his/her vicious circle. If you find yourself feel sorry or sad, stop it. Don't empathize and don't try to help or offer the solution. Try to concentrate on your work and let her know it from the very beginning of your working day. If she starts to talk about problems, listen to her politely to some extend, then show her that you ""accept"" and ""understand"" what she told you and then either change the subject or tell her that now you have to concentrate on your duties. You can eventually tell her that she is the one who has to resolve her problems and that you cannot help her, but don't let yourself be a part of her problems. And don't be surprised if she reacts on it as if you are not empathic enough, you don't understand her or something like that. This is a usual strategy to make you feel guilty, because SOMEBODY HAS TO BE GUILTY, for her. Stay out and remember that it is not easy. If nothing helps, talk with your superior to eventually move you to another office.\n\nadditional details:\nYou obviously know him very well. You said that those persons are like chameleons and are very good in that. That is exactly the characteristic of manipulator. Don't blame yourself for feeling sorry and offer a support. It is normal human reaction and every normal person would do that. But if you feel permanently guilty and exhausted in communication with him, stop it. YOUR guilty feelings and exhausting are sure signs that you have a problem with manipulator. NOBODY HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT."

"if me &my girl had not removed our clothes & we slept then there is need of condom?why?explain in detail?

Okay, I'll assume when you said 'slept' you SLEPT.  Or am I being naive?\n\nLook, if semen somehow got near her vaginal opening, there is always a chance that she could get pregnant.  If there was no penetration per se, there was no exchange of bodily fluids from her to you, but she could have been subjected to whatever you were carrying, if somehow there was enough seminal fluid to soak through her underwear to come in contact with the vaginal opening.\n\nWere you for real just sleeping, or were ya'll playing around?  If just sleeping, there is no need for a condom, period.  If playing around, even if fully clothed, if there was enough fluid to come in contact with her, then theoretically, she could get pregnant.  \n\nCondoms are usually used for the purpose of barrier contraception, used during penetrative sexual activity."

"telephone monitoring laws for alabama?
can a employer legally monitor your phone conversations at work without either party being aware of such actions?

I am 19 and I need to get in shape in 2 weeks, I am quite skinny I just need my\nabs to look decent so does anyone one know any quick way I get at\nleast get them defined in 2 weeks? serious answers please. thanks in advance.
Jacky has the best answer so far, but its unlikely that you are going to see anything serious in two weeks.  The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.  This requires crunches but sit ups will work if you don't have access to a machine.\n\nYou could try taking creatine ester.  It causes your existing muscles to swell a little bit.  It might make you look a little better in the two weeks.  You get it at the health food store.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to tone and increase your build, you need to join a gym because its really difficult to do it without machines.  Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.  Get it from meat and whey supplements.  Carbs are not your friend, but you still need them in moderation.  I have found the unground beef steak is the best for me.  It seems to have the best bang for the buck as compared to chicken or pork."

You then mail 200 copies of the letter you received with your name included now on the letter because you removed the first name on the list and placed yours on the number six slot, to 200 people (names that you buy from a lead company) and then in around 3 months you will end up receiving approximately $800,000. Anyone with details about this kind of letters and have tried it, please give me some feedback about your experience with it.

Generally speaking, you have to have a contractor's license because you are going to be selling a service. It's fairly lengthy, but, last I checked, it was open book. It's best to check with Virginia's licensing information through the county you live in. Also, if you're trying to do work in the tri state area, like MD, VA and DC- you might want to ""partner up"" with some other subs so you can work under each other's umbrella of licenses and insurances."

x^2-x-6 = (x-3)(x+2)\nFor x=-2 or x=3, this equals 0.  So look at three cases:\n\nCase 1: x<-2\nHere x-3<0 and x+2<0.  So (x-3)(x+2)>0 (Product of two negatives is positive).\n\nCase 2: -2<x<3\nHere x-3<0 and x+2>0.  So (x-3)(x+2)<0 (Product of a negative and a positive is negative)\n\nCase 3: x>3\nHere x-3>0 and x+2>0.

"What does the Iron Curtain have to do with the Holocaust?

The Iron curtain is the isolation imposed by the cold war between URSS and EU after World War II.  The holocaust happened during World War II.  Some concentration camps were in Germany, but ohter were in Austria.  Not to mistake the Iron curtain with the Berlin Wall, although both are symbols of the same political reality."
"Can someone explain this to me?
When I used to go to church, we always heard the parable of the ten minas (coins) Luke 19, but I just re read it and realised that every time I've heard it, the last verse has been omitted.  Verse 27 says: [jesus said] ""But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be a king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me.""\n\nNow you can understand why I'm slightly confused, not a very jesusy thing to say is it?  Can someone explain a) why he said this (i looked up the context in my mums study bible, but this verse is ignored entirely, like it doesn't exist) b) why when i used to go to church would they not read this out.
The Bible has changed quite a bit over time and by different people.  It would be easy to switch one or two words around and get a completely different meaning.\nI would suggest you try looking at different Bibles and see the differences.  Maybe an older version might not have had that in it.\nThat line sounds to me like Jesus was justifying the Crusade, which I highly doubt he would have."

"Newton's Prism and Spinoza's lens?
Can someone please briefly explain the basic concepts and importance of Newton's prism and Spinoza's lens? All of the websites I've found have long drawn out explanations, so I was hoping someone could explain in simpler terms. Thanks!
Hmmm.  Reading “Tulips” by Padraic Colum?  Anyway…\n\nBoth are optical instruments of the late 17th Century.  Newton used a prism to break sunlight up into its contituent colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and infinitely fine gradations in between.  Spinoza, although nowadays more famous for his philosophy, actually made a living grinding lenses for telescopes and such.  Both tools bend and distort light, and both have (relatively) simple mathematical descriptions.\n\nIf indeed, the aforementioned poem is what called to mind the question, I think the reference has to do with the abstract mathematics of prisms and lenses translating into real-world manipulation of light.\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York"

"alternative ways to conduct an insurance business?
Does anyone have any creative legal ideas as to how I can start an insurance business without it technically being insurance? I want to write up insurance policies and collect monthly premiums from customers I sign up. I have the ability to payout any claims they would make in the future. However I would prefer not having to get the proper licensing, but will do so if I must. In other words, how can I collect monthly payments from customers that entitle them to x-amount of dollars if they make a claim, WITHOUT IT TECHNICALLY BEING STRUCTURED AS ""INSURANCE?""
What is the nature of the risk you are ""insuring""? For example, Auto insurance protects against the risk one faces from having an accident.\n\nA type of business that falls into your line of thinking is third party warranties. Think about extended warranties on products. You buy them, typically when you purchase the product. You agree to the terms of the contract and it protects you from the risk of the product breaking, but it is not insurance.\n\nIt depends on the nature of the risk you are offering protection against."

"what is the meaning of Hallelujah?

(m)\n\n\nHallelujah is a remarkable word. In the Bible, it appears only in the book of Psalms; yet this exuberant exclamation of joy and gratitude has survived the passage of centuries, transcending the barriers of language and culture. What exactly does it mean? \n\nAccording to the Talmud, Hallelujah is the most sublime expression of God's praise, combining together in one word both praise (hallel) and God's Name (the two-letter Name 'Ya-H'). Yet Hallelujah does not appear throughout the book of Psalms. It is only used in the last third of the book, starting with chapter 104. \n\n""Let sin be finished from the earth, and evil be no more. My soul will bless God, Hallelujah!"" [Ps. 104:35]  \n\n\nWhat is special about this particular verse, that it contains the very first usage of the word Hallelujah? The Sages noted that the theme of this verse is the destruction of evil. King David, they explained, only began employing this declaration of God's praise after he witnessed the downfall of the wicked. \n\n\nIn what way does Hallelujah relate to the downfall of the wicked? \n\nWhy does it contain the short, two-letter Name of God, and not the full Name of God (consisting of four letters), which is more commonly used? \n\nWe need first to determine the inner meaning of the Name 'Ya-H'. This Name for God appears in the Torah after Amalek's unprovoked attack on the Jews, as they left Egypt. God took an oath, as it were, ""upon the throne of Ya-H, a war against Amalek throughout the generations."" [Ex 17:16] The Sages explained that as long as evil exists in the world — as long as Amalek has not been destroyed - God's Name is incomplete, containing only two letters. \nThus the Name 'Ya-H' refers to the state in which the world is not yet perfected. As long as there is room for evil and violence in the world, God's rule is incomplete. God's full Name belongs to the era in which the corrupted spirit will be destroyed, evil will dissipate like smoke, and all will acknowledge and praise God with His complete Name. \n\nThe most elevated praise, combining God's praise with His full Name, belongs to a future time. But the praise of Hallelujah reflects a sublime form of praise suitable for our days. \n\nIf we can raise our sights and understand the purpose of evil, if we can grasp that a world in which evil existed and was subsequently overcome is greater than one in which evil never played a part, then we can honestly combine God's praise with the Name 'Ya-H'. This combination indicates that we recognize the value of a world in which corruption is allowed to exist. Hallelujah is an expression of this lofty outlook, acknowledging God's praise in an incomplete world. \n\nKing David succeeded in reaching this level when he witnessed the fall of the wicked. ""Let sin be finished and evil be no more."" He understood the function of the wicked and their downfall, and at that point was able to call out: Hallelujah!"
"why are asians so damn smart?

I am an Asian.\nFirstly - Asians as a class dont think they are smart.\n\nSecondly - They think that there is a lot of things that they dont know.\n\nThirdly - They work (like all others) to achieving that knowledge without any great expectation since many Asians are not as wealthy their counterparts from some other continents and consequently have less desire for wealth.\n\nFourthly - They know that the people of other continents have become wealthy by dint of hard labour and dedication.\n\nFifthly - They try to emulate the performance of the people from other continents.\n\nSixthly - This gives them something to aspire to which makes them work harder than those who are already at the pinnacle \n\nSeventhly - Moral - We should never allow ourselves to fall into the morass of discrimination due to Religion, Race, Caste, Creed, Regionalism etc because (Quoting a phrase from Shakespeare) - ""these dull the edge of husbandry"".\nSo if anyone works when it is time to work and has a gala time when it is time to have a gala time will always remain SMART. And when there is no work during work time they must work towards acquiring knowledge of things they do not know about - this gives them the edge!"
"what two events led up to the formation of the first eukaryotic cells?

It was first suggested in the 1920s that simple organic molecules could form and spontaneously polymerize into macromolecules under the conditions thought to exist in primitive Earth's atmosphere. At the time life arose, the atmosphere of Earth is thought to have contained little or no free oxygen, instead consisting principally of CO2 and N2 in addition to smaller amounts of gases such as H2, H2S, and CO. Such an atmosphere provides reducing conditions in which organic molecules, given a source of energy such as sunlight or electrical discharge, can form spontaneously. The spontaneous formation of organic molecules was first demonstrated experimentally in the 1950s, when Stanley Miller (then a graduate student) showed that the discharge of electric sparks into a mixture of H2, CH4, and NH3, in the presence of water, led to the formation of a variety of organic molecules, including several amino acids. Although Miller's experiments did not precisely reproduce the conditions of primitive Earth, they clearly demonstrated the plausibility of the spontaneous synthesis of organic molecules, providing the basic materials from which the first living organisms arose."

"What is the best book to learn about game theory without math but with real life examples?

Look for a business strategy book with a chapter on game theory. The more academic ones at university libraries are probably better because they explicitly describe game theory, but since the book is about Business Strategy, they typically ignore most of the math and give real world business examples instead. The ones for business practioners at your local bookstore often give good examples, but fail to describe how the example relates to game theory. \n\nOr consider The Strategy of Conflict for a very in depth but non-mathematical look at negotiation and conflict from a game theory perspective (though this book does not explicitly explain game theory)."
"Crazy idea?
I once heard of a scheme to dispose of nuclear waste by putting it on a rocket and firing it away from the planet, but the idea was abandoned because of cost and danger of a mechanical failure in the rocket...\n\nWhy not blend radioactive waste with iron and fire it out of a massive magnetic accelerator gun and into an orbit where it isn't likely to come back any time soon? The gun would be reusable, much less can go wrong mechanically, there aren't even any combustibles involved...  Does this sound plausible?
It is possible, at about $20,000/pound to just shoot it to the sun.  Just one ton, a few barrels of nuclear sludge, would cost $40M.  \n\nAnd railgun technology, tho potentially much cheaper per pound, has a ways to go yet, more so in the research and funding than the physics.  Still won't be cheap tho.  The space elevator probably has an edge there. As well, current conventional space craft approaches with reusable launch vehicles are making great progress which will be paying off in just the next decade.\n\nAnyway, maybe someday when spaceflight is a bit more economical"

"What are two effects organized religion has had on society?

Expansion for one. Missionaries carried the word of their gods to many tribes which would otherwise have just killed any strangers they met. The resulting expansion of trade encouraged development and research of resources which might otherwise be inaccessible.\nA strong moral code of ritual and conformity encourages cultural risk taking and production. Good for business, especially when a religion encourages its members to cooperate and obey (secular) government authority, rather than only religious authority.\nIt has also increased the size of wars. By combining people under a single purpose or religious code, many cultures can be used to fight larger battles that would otherwise have only been between locales over physical resources, rather than between regions over perceived moral threats."
"How bad is sugar for you? Where does it go on your body?
Does sugar settle on your body, or can you burn it off?
It depends on when and how much you indulge.  \n\nIf you are working physically hard or participating in wind sprints, it is a marvelous energy booster.  It gets into your system quickly and is burned just as quickly.\n\nIf you eat a bunch of sweets just before bed it can help in the creation of tooth decay.  The body has no need to use it while you sleep so it is stored in your body for later use.  Unfortunately the body prefers the what's in there right now response.  It does not go for the stored energy first.  \n\nIt needs to be burnt off almost as soon as you put it in your mouth.  And it can go anywhere in your body.  With guys, it's usually the gut.  With women it's belly, butt and thighs.\n\nThe worst place it can deposit is on your internal organs.  That fat contributes to heart attacks, strokes, pancreatic failure, etc, etc.\n\nNatural sugars found in fruits aren't as deleterious as refined white sugar (or brown sugar)  That form of sweetness tends to come with complimenting enzymes, and is more healthful."

"What the crap does ""E=mc2"" mean?
moo.
The theoretical physics equation E = mc2 states a relationship between energy (E), in whatever form, and mass (m). In this formula, c², the square of the speed of light in vacuum, is the conversion factor required to formally convert from units of mass to units of energy, i.e. the energy per unit mass. In unit specific terms, E (Joules) = M (kilograms) · (299792458 m/s) 2.\n\nThis formula, which was discovered by Albert Einstein, proposes that when a body has a mass (measured at rest), it has a certain (a very large) amount of energy associated with this mass. This is opposed to the Newtonian mechanics, in which a massive body at rest has no kinetic energy, and may or may not have other (relatively small) amounts of internal stored energy (such as chemical or thermal energy), in addition to any potential energy it may have from its position in a field of force. That is why a body's mass, in Einstein's theory, is often called the rest energy of the body. The E of the formula can be seen as the total energy of the body, which is proportional to the mass when the body is at rest.\n\nConversely, a single photon travelling in empty space cannot be considered to have an effective mass, m, according to the above equation. The reason is that such a photon cannot be measured in any way to be at ""rest"" and the formula above applies only to single particles when they are at rest. Photons are generally considered to be ""massless,"" (i.e., they have no rest mass or invariant mass) even though they have varying amounts of energy.\n\n\nENERGY=MASS x Speed square \n\n\nbtw  check out my website \n\nhttp://oldman.netfirms.com/"
"Adrenaline, aka epinephrin, works on fight, flight n fright. has it got to do anything wid human feelings?

Epinephrine (INN) (IPA: [ˌɛpiˈnɛfrən]) or adrenaline (BAN) (IPA: [əˈdrɛnələn]), sometimes spelled ""epinephrin"" or ""adrenalin"" respectively, is a hormone and a neurotransmitter. Epinephrine is a catecholamine, a sympathomimetic monoamine derived from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The Latin roots ad-+renes and the Greek roots epi-+nephros both literally mean ""on/to the kidney"" (referring to the adrenal gland, which secretes epinephrine). Epinephrine is sometimes shortened to epi in medical jargon.\n\nIn May 1886, William Bates reported the discovery of a substance produced by the adrenal gland in the New York Medical Journal. Epinephrine was isolated and identified in 1895 by Napoleon Cybulski, a Polish physiologist. The discovery was repeated in 1897 by John Jacob Abel. Jokichi Takamine discovered the same hormone in 1900, without knowing about the previous discovery; but, in later years, counterevidence is shown from the experiment note that Kaminaka leaves that the Takamine team is the discoverer of first adrenaline. It was first artificially synthesized in 1904 by Friedrich Stolz.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Actions in the body \n2 Pharmacology \n3 Terminology \n4 See also \n5 References \n \n\n\n[edit]\nActions in the body\nEpinephrine plays a central role in the short-term stress reaction—the physiological response to threatening, exciting or environmental stressor conditions such as high noise levels or bright light (see Fight-or-flight response). It is secreted by the adrenal medulla. When released into the bloodstream, epinephrine binds to multiple receptors and has numerous effects throughout the body. It increases heart rate and stroke volume, dilates the pupils, and constricts arterioles in the skin and gut while dilating arterioles in leg muscles. It elevates the blood sugar level by increasing hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose in the liver, and at the same time begins the breakdown of lipids in adipocytes. Epinephrine has a suppressive effect on the immune system.\n\nEpinephrine is used as a drug to promote peripheral vascular resistance via alpha-stimulated vasoconstriction in cardiac arrest and other cardiac dysrhythmias resulting in diminished or absent cardiac output, such that blood is shunted to the body's core. This beneficial action comes with a significant negative consequence—increased cardiac irritability—which may lead to additional complications immediately following an otherwise successful resuscitation. Alternatives to this treatment include vasopressin, a powerful antidiuretic which also increases peripheral vascular resistance leading to blood shunting via vasoconstriction, but without the attendant increase to myocardial irritability.\n\nBecause of its suppressive effect on the immune system, epinephrine is used to treat anaphylaxis and sepsis. Allergy patients undergoing immunotherapy may receive an epinephrine rinse before the allergen extract is administered, thus reducing the immune response to the administered allergen. It is also used as a bronchodilator for asthma if specific beta-2-adrenergic agonists are unavailable or ineffective. Adverse reactions to epinephrine include palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, headache, tremor, hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema.\n\nA pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal gland (or, rarely, the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system), which secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines, usually epinephrine.\n\n[edit]\nPharmacology\nEpinephrine's actions are mediated through adrenergic receptors (sometimes referred to as adrenoceptors).\n\nIt binds to α1 receptors of liver cells, which activate inositol-phospholipid signaling pathway, signaling the phosphorylation of insulin, leading to reduced ability of insulin to bind to its receptors.\n\nEpinephrine also activates β-adrenergic receptors of the liver and muscle cells, thereby activating the adenylate cyclase signaling pathway, whic"

"The numerous layers of sedimentary rock found along the Grand Canyon were formed by what?

To understand sedimentary rock layers, it is important to understand that the earth's surface is always slowly - but constantly - changing.  Mountains and other areas that are raised above the surrounding land are subject to wind, rain, and water which constantly wear them down.  The bits of sand, pebbles, and rubble that get worn down from mountains, mesas, and cliffs are pulled by gravity to the low-lying areas (valleys, lake beds, sea-shores) where they collect over time.  Over millions of years, these deposits can harden and petrify into sedimentary rock layers.  Other sedimentary rock layers (like limestone) form on ancient sea or lake beds and are the remains of the various animals and plants that lived in the water.\n\nThus when you look at the different layers of the Grand Canyon, you are looking at the petrified remains of what was once the surface of the earth (or the bottom of a sea bed) at a time the region was being covered with sedimentary material.  Different rock layers occur when changes to the environment cause one type of material to stop being deposited and new materials get deposited instead.  For example, a shallow sea may create layers of limestone.  If the sea later dries up and the now exposed sea bed gets covered over with blowing dry sand, then a layer of sandstone will be deposited on top of the limestone.  In this way, geologists can see how the surface of the earth changes at a given spot over time.\n\nAs for the specific rock layers in the Grand Canyon, here is a VERY SIMPLISTIC description of the situation and processes that produced the major rock layers (from the oldest layer at the bottom to newest at the top):\n\nVishnu Schist (bottom) - 1.7+ billion years ago the area around Grand Canyon was a series of volcanic islands surrounded by a shallow sea.  The resulting deposits of ash, sand, and mud created shales, sandstones and mudestones that were eventually compressed and distorted with time and pressure into gneiss and schist.\n\nTapeats Sandstone - There is a long period where the rocks from this area did not survive and so no record is left (the Great Unconformity).  Eventually this area became part of the edge of the still forming North American continent.  Sandy beaches in this area around 540 million years ago created this sandstone formation.\n\nBright Angel Shale - The water moved further inland, causing this area to be frequently underwater and covered with deposits of mud (which is where shale comes from).\n\nMuav Limestone - The water got deeper and the area became part of the sea-floor proper leading to limestone deposits.\n\nFollowing the Muav Limestone, the sea appears to have receded and the land was again above water.  Little is left from this period.\n\nRedwall Limestone - Around 363 million years ago, the sea moves in rapidly again and the area is once again part of a sea floor leading to limestone deposits.\n\nSupai Group and Hermit Shale - This is actually a lot of smaller layers (a mix of shales, mudstones, and limestones) created as the sea came in and went out numerous times over a period of 30 million years.\n\nCoconino Sandstone - The seas pulled back and this part of North America became part of a vast sand-dune filled desert (similar to North Africa).  The Coconino Sandstone is the petrified remains of ancient sand dunes.\n\nToroweap Formation and Kaibab Limestone (top of canyon) - The sea came back and turned the area first into shallow mud flats (Toroweap) and then drowned it completely into a sea floor (Kaibab) about 240 million years ago.\n\nOne frequent related question... how can Grand Canyon rock layers be from the bottom of a sea when the canyon rim is at 6000+ feet elevation, did the water get that high?  The answer is no... at the time that the sea floor deposits were created, this part of North America was much lower (ie: below sea level).  \n\nThe reason you can find limestone rock layers with fossil fish and clams at high elevations above current se"
"What do girls think about boys that shave their genitals? How much should I shave? And how to do it?
I like to think that girls shave theirselves, but I am not sure if they think the same way.
Some women that I have known do not like completely hairless male genitals, for some reason. Nor do very many like it ""all natural."" They do, however, very much like it neatly trimmed. So unless your lady tells you she prefers it otherwise, I would advise you to go with trimming.\n\nFull shaving is rather tricky for a guy to do, but it can be done, and personally I prefer doing this to mine.

What i want to know is somebody elses experience after sinsus surgery and if they know of any pain relief, as i cant find any kind of tablet to take the edge of.
How long ago did you have it done?  As soon as the ENT pulled the 4 billion yards of gauze (LOL) out of my sinus (3 days after surgery) I felt fine.  I could breathe well for the first time in years.  And it's still good 8 years post-op.  I only needed the Percocet for the first two days.  I never had ear aches or tooth aches.  You better talk to your surgeon."
"hemorrhoids?
I  have an extermley painful and larger external hemmorrhoid I went to a clinic today and he froze the hemmy by a needle and proceeded to cut open the hemmy and squeeze out a tiny blood clot and sent me home -I am now in lots of pain and nothing seemed to help - have any of you had this done before and were you perscribed any follow up care or medication?...Any tips on things to help??\n\nThanks
call your doctor to see if he/she can prescribe you something for the pain, if not than i think you should call or go to the emergency room if the pain get's to bad also there is some spray at the drug store you can ask the pharmacist about and it works wonders!instant relief, i used it after i had my babies."

"What happens if you miss a birth control pill?
I'm not sexually active, I'm just taking the pill to regulate my period.
you have to double up on the next dose....\n\nA back-up birth-control method is necessary for at least two days if you miss a dose (even if it is delayed by only three hours\n\nWhat if I forget to take a pill? \nIf you forget to take some of the pills, you will have menstrual bleeding at unpredictable times and you may get pregnant.\n\nIf you forget to take one pill, take it as soon as you remember and take your next pill at the usual time. If you miss two consecutive pills, take two pills each day for 2 days and then go back to your regular schedule.\n\nIf you miss three or more pills, stop taking the pills and use a different birth control method until your next menstrual cycle starts. If your menstrual cycle doesn't start on schedule, check with your health care provider.\n\nIf you have forgotten to take two or more pills and you have missed a period, you might be pregnant. You should stop taking the pills and use other forms of birth control until you are sure you are not pregnant.\n\nDo not stop taking the pills if you have taken them correctly."
"do you believe in equal wealth for everyone?
also, do you think we should just give money to homeless people even if they don't try to work and get back on their feet themselves? why or why not?
Not really some have it easier than others, and some are lucky. But homeless ppl it would be good to do, but I don't believe most will desirer too. Because they would probably spend there money on drugs and alcohol instead of trying to better their self. If they been poor all their lives and are now homeless, then it would be very difficult to try and break that from them. It's not always true that people are homeless because they are lazy. But they could be down on their luck, depress or just find confort in drugs. Many things can effect someones condition. We have to understand that most people like these grow up in a poor community living among people with this same problem. By doing this they could or Will develop a spirit of poverty, which is the worst thing that could happen to a person. You can steal from someone, cheat someone, or hurt someone. But those things can be fix. But want could replace a soul who spirit is dead, that is probably the hardest thing to repair is someone will to win. If you can encourage hope and a since of love to others then you could create a will in them. that's the frist step in helping someone who may have been abuse, depress, or whatever the case because no kid grows up to be a bomb, homeless, and poor."
"Why did God send God's son to save us from our sins? Why didn't God come instead?

He did, His name is Jesus. He came because we were unable to do anything to get right with God, who is a Spirit.  He took the form of a man, Jesus, and thus was able to communicate with us.  He, being God and man, was able to take all of our sins: past, present and future and pay the penalty of death for all of us.  We have right standing by believing in what He did and who He is, not by what we ourselves do. We do good because we believe and have turned away from our old ways and desires."
"Why do people give friends silly nicknames?
A friend of mine likes to call me Galdon which has no correlation with my real name. It's not a term of endearment. Is it an attempt for psychological advantage? Do people feel better when they call their friends weird and silly nicknames?\n\nMy friends behaves like this with all of his / her friends. I know he has low self-esteem and chronically depressed.\n\nAny insights?
It's just one of those things, it's cute. It's clever. Nickname can have many meanings, but be sure that it is not neutral. \n\nSome bullies give the kids they pick on nicknames, maybe to lower their self-esteem, or to make themself feel better\n\nSome couples give their significant other nicknames to show their affection\n\nSome friends give their other friends nicknames just because it is a sign of friendship, something that they can call you (and they know the inside joke, and even if there is no inside joke, the inside joke is that there IS NO INSIDE JOKE, just some random thing).\n\nI know for some reason, my friends all started for some reason to say that I'm german. I have no idea why, everytime this happens, I'm like ""What are you talking about?!"" In that particular case, it's just something that they came up with that is pretty funny cause it's random, something that can be associated with me that is comical I guess.\n\nI actually in response, after I changed schools, whenever my friend would make fun of me (in all fun) I would say something about him being from sweden, and it's just so funny because it's random, and everytime after that you say it, it's funny because it's so random, but it's something you associate with that person since you did it. Other people get a kick outta the randomnest and the almost 100% possibility of it being wrong, but still acting like they believe it.\n\nI really don't know how to put it into words exactly.\nAll I can say for your situation is that for some reason, whatever person your dealing with might of been feeling so crazy that day, he decided to give you some whacked up name, and sometimes name's stick, and he calls you that ever since. \nVery logical reason why.\n\nAnd are you so sure it's not an term of endearment? Sometimes people get a little attached to enemies or things they don't like, and a little bit of attachment is all you need for a term of endearment.\n\nLet me give you a quick example before I end this little rant/essay. I used to hate this kid in school, but he had a nickname. After I graduated, I saw this kid again, even though an enemy, was pretty happy to see him because he brought back all the old times, but I still greeted him as lil (female dog, that was his nickname)"
"what exactly is the difference between ""gain"" and ""volume"" control on an amp?
rock on!
Gain is the amount the amplifier increases the amplitude of the signal. Volume is how mouch the signal is attenuated at the output side of the amplifier. They really do the same thing, however it is simpler circuit wise to use an attenuating circuit on the output side of the amplifier than to use a variable gain amplifier. Most amplifiers are designed to provide a fixed gain that is only adjusted by an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) to prevent over driving the amp and the resultant ""clipping"" of the signal."
"Are boiled vegetables good for health?

It depends in comparison to what.  A boiled cauliflower stalk will always be better than an onion ring, no matter how many nutrients are leached away.\n\nThe best way to eat vegetables is washed and raw.  Second best is lightly sauteed or stir fried so they're a bit softer but still crunchy and fresh tasting.  Third best is steamed.  After that would be roasted or grilled and then boiled.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with boiled vegetables and they certainly are not a harm to your health.  But, the longer they are boiled, the more nutrients are killed due to the high heat.\n\nBy the way, nutrients don't ""wash"" away in boiling water.  They're killed/rendered ineffective due to the high, constant heat that permeates the entire item being boiled.\n\nHOW TO STEAM:\nFor under $20, you can buy a food steamer at Target or Wal-Mart.  It's a great investment.  You can steam veggies, poach eggs, cook rice, etc. in about 5-10 minutes for less effort and healthier results than trying to steam on the stove.\n\nHOW TO BOIL:\nPut pot on stove, add water, add veggies, turn on to high/medium-high heat and remove veggies when squishy. :)\n\nHOW TO SAUTEE:\nTake out a skillet and add some sort of fat (I recommend olive oil or safflower oil).  Turn to medium-high heat and let get warm.  Add veggies and let coat in the fat.  Keep tossing the veggies around until they start to give a little.  (For lower fat needs, reduce the oil and add a bit of water.  Also, use a stick-free skillet.)"
"Has anyone heard of the 3 Day Diet?
Is it effective and on the remaining 4 days can you have a drink as I was thinking that you could if you allowed for it calorie-wise. Also does anyone have any other suggestions of diets that would suit someone who still wanted to enjoy a drink? \nThanks
Here is a simple answer, based on life experience.\nThere are no magic solutions !!!\nIf you want to reduce your weight without any pills, suffering, chemicals and so on, just reduce the amount of food you eat and get some basic exercise.\nInstead of watching TV, Go out, take a walk.\nEat Cereal instead of doritos and drink plenty of water.\nDon't skip breakfast, but do skip these cookies you have with your coffee.\nIt may take 3 months and not 3 days, but if you keep it, you are guaranteed to keep the weight off and not to gain it back in two weeks."

I have been working with this company for four months and the manager decided to hire another girl to help out in the office. they have not clearly stated what she will be doing and what duties i'll be keeping or changing. Was it wrong of me to request a job description?
No it was absolutely the right thing to do. 1st you are showing an interest in the co. 2nd you are just trying to find out if you are qualified for the position, and if you are it would benefit the co. to promote from within if it is indeed a higher paying position than you are already in. 3rd, and last but not least, an employer should think well of an employee trying to better theirself and benefit theco. at the same time.

"Plleeeeeeease tell my daughter what vomiting means! Will you?
She asks that every morning. :-(
1) Vomiting means emptying your stomach by a strong gag and retch that leads to throwing up. \n\n2) Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth. Although it has probably evolved as a mechanism for expelling ingested poisons, vomiting may result from many causes not related to poisoning, ranging from gastritis to brain tumors, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea. It usually precedes vomiting, but it does not always lead to vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may need to be adminstered."

"Severe iron deficiency anemia treatment in special needs children?(running out of options!)?
My daughter is 4 1/2 and we have tried iron rich food, iron supplements, everything PO that we could, we moved on to IV iron but after several treatments she developed an allergy to it. We just recently tried a different form of IV iron but that had no effect on her at all.  Now the docs are telling me that the only option we have left is regular blood transfusion which is very risky. I have been told that whenever I take her in to get a transfusion I must realize that I may not be taking her home with me.  I am desperate to find out if there is any alternative that anyone knows of.  Anything is better than the reality that I am currently faced with, please help and thank you.
This is a very tough question.\n\nHave the doctors try to premedicate him so that he doesn't develop an allergy?  At least in adult medicine, we sometimes premedicate a patient with benadryl and prednisone before giving IV contrast (its a chemical that we inject in people so to obtain a CT scan) if they are allergic to it.  So if you premedicate the child, he may not develop the allergy.\n\nWhat I am curious about is why is he not absorbing or utilizing oral iron supplements?  Giving vitamin C with iron supplements sometimes helps with the absorption of iron.  Which iron rich foods have you tried?  Remember red meats and liver are excellent sources of iron and are easily absorbable.  In chinese culture and a few european cultures, cooked blood is eaten."
"How did ageing evolve and why do different species have different life spans?

Whether or not someone ""believes"" in evolution dosn't change the fact of it.\n\nAging most likely isn't a product of evolution. Living takes energy, and reproduction takes even more. The biological makeup of any organism can only tolerate just so much stress and normal wear and tear. After awhile, the organism begins to undergo chemical and organic breakdown. The differences in life spans between species are most likely the result of the sort of energy expenditures for which the particular species in question were programed for."

"What is Bessel Theorem?

Bessel functions of the first kind\n\nBessel functions of the first kind, denoted with Jα(x), are solutions of Bessel's differential equation which are finite at x = 0 for α an integer or α non-negative. The specific choice and normalization of Jα are defined by its properties below; another possibility is to define it by its Taylor series expansion around x = 0 (or a more general power series for non-integer α):\n\n    J_&#92;alpha(x) = &#92;sum_{m=0}^&#92;infty &#92;frac{(-1)^m}{m! &#92;Gamma(m+&#92;alpha+1)} {&#92;left({&#92;frac{x}{2}}&#92;right)}^{2m+&#92;alpha}\n\nHere, Γ(z) is the gamma function, a generalization of the factorial to non-integer values. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√x (see also their asymptotic forms, below), although their roots are not generally periodic except asymptotically for large x.\nPlot of Bessel function of the first kind, Jα</math>(x), for integer orders α=0,1,2.\nEnlarge\nPlot of Bessel function of the first kind, Jα</math>(x), for integer orders α=0,1,2.\n\nIf α is not an integer, the functions Jα(x) and J − α(x) are linearly independent and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, if the order α is an integer, then the following relationship is valid:\n\n    J_{-&#92;alpha}(x) = (-1)^{&#92;alpha} J_{&#92;alpha}(x)&#92;,\n\nThis means that they are no longer linearly independent. The second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.\n\n\nBessel's integrals\n\nAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of α, is possible using an integral equation:\n\n    J_&#92;alpha (x) = &#92;frac{1}{2 &#92;pi} &#92;int_{0}^{2 &#92;pi} &#92;cos (&#92;alpha &#92;tau - x &#92;sin &#92;tau) d&#92;tau.\n\n(For the full expression for real values of α, see Abramowitz and Stegun (1972) page 360)\n\nThis is the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. Another integral representation is:\n\n    J_&#92;alpha (x) = &#92;frac{1}{2 &#92;pi} &#92;int_{-&#92;pi}^{&#92;pi} e^{i(&#92;alpha &#92;tau - x &#92;sin &#92;tau)} d&#92;tau\n\n\n\nRelation to hypergeometric series\n\nThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric series as\n\n    J_&#92;alpha(z)=&#92;frac{(z/2)^&#92;alpha}{&#92;Gamma(&#92;alpha+1)} &#92;;_0F_1 (&#92;alpha+1; -z^2/4).\n\n\n\nBessel functions of the second kind\n\nThese are perhaps the most commonly used forms of the Bessel functions.\n\nThe Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by Yα(x), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation. They are singular (infinite) at x = 0.\n\nYα(x) is sometimes also called the Neumann function, and is occasionally denoted instead by Nα(x). It is related to Jα(x) by:\n\n    Y_&#92;alpha(x) = &#92;frac{J_&#92;alpha(x) &#92;cos(&#92;alpha&#92;pi) - J_{-&#92;alpha}(x)}{&#92;sin(&#92;alpha&#92;pi)},\n\nwhere the case of integer α is handled by taking the limit.\n\nWhen α is not an integer, the definition of Yα is redundant (as is clear from its definition above). On the other hand, when α is an integer, Yα is the second linearly independent solution of Bessel's equation; moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:\n\n    Y_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x)&#92;,\n\nBoth Jα(x) and Yα(x) are holomorphic functions of x on the complex plane cut along the negative real axis. When α is an integer, there is no branch point, and the Bessel functions are entire functions of x. If x is held fixed, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of α.\nPlot of Bessel function of the second kind, Yα</math>(x), for integer orders α=0,1,2.\nEnlarge\nPlot of Bessel function of the second kind, Yα</math>(x), for integer orders α=0,1,2.\n\n\nHankel functions\n\nA"

"Has Health and Safety gone too far??  Give example?

Uh, yeah.  They have really gone too far.

The church was able to get several local businesses to pledge funds so they could buy a building.  Seemed like a great idea and everything was going just fine -- until OSHA got involved.  It would have cost four times more than the cost of the building to bring it up to OSHA standards because they told the church the building MUST have access for the physically disabled, a working elevator, fire suppression systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, a certain number of bathrooms (with a certain number of toilets in each one), an infirmary; the list goes on and on.  And of course, everything in the building from the floors to the walls to the paint to the pipes had to conform to OSHA standards.  As a result, the church scrapped the idea.

"Do you think after this life we will have another life ????????

Your question assumes that I have a life now.  People keep telling me to get a life, so I might have a problem answering you. :-P\n\nSeriously, whether you believe there is life after death depends on what you believe about religion.  If there is a God, then there is a good chance that we have a soul that survives after death.  If there is no God, then it's less certain.\n\nIt's hard to tell whether there is a spiritual world around and beyond us that we can't see.  Despite a lot of testing, no scientist has ever found a ghost, or confirmed a miracle.  But, there are many stories told by people whose bodies have died for a short time and then been brought back to life by doctors.  All of these people tell the same story, even though they've never met.  They all went through a sort of tunnel of light, moving upward to a place of great peace and joy.  Some describe reaching that place briefly and encountering God.  If you are interested in these ""near-death experiences,"" I recommend that you read the work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, who took down many such stories.\n\nYou also have to take into account all of the reports of miracles and visions that people have experienced throughout history, and continue to experience today.  Scientists have found non-spiritual explanations for some of these things, but not all of them.  They all point toward the existence of God (or many gods), and many of the visions describe an afterlife.\n\nYour question leads to another important question: Since we do not know for certain whether there is an afterlife, how should we live in this life?  Should we live in the way we think is ""good,"" even if it's sometimes hard; or should we go ahead and do whatever we want to do?\n\nThe brilliant French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, looked at your question hundreds of years ago.  He came up with a solution, which is known as ""Pascal's Wager.""  (""Wager"" is another word for ""bet."")  Pascal, who was a Christian, believed that the Bible contained God's advice for how to live.  He figured that if there was a God, then God's advice for how to live must be ""good.""  He also figured that, if there was no God, then there probably was no afterlife, either.\n\nHe said: ""Okay.  Let's say that I live my life in a good way.  If there is no afterlife, then my life on Earth will be okay, but uncomfortable at times.  If there is an afterlife, then I will go to Heaven.\n\n""Now, let's say that I don't live in a good way.  If there is no afterlife, then I've had an okay life with no discomfort, because I've done whatever I wanted to do.  But if there is an afterlife, then I will go to Hell.\n\n""So, if I live a good life, the best thing that can happen is that I'll go to Heaven.  At worst, I'll have an okay life with some pains in the butt.  If I live a 'bad' life, the very best thing that can happen is an okay life with no pains in the butt.  At worst, I'll go to Hell.\n\n""No matter what, if I'm good I'll come out way better, or at worst only a little worse-off, than I will if I'm bad.  So, I'll be good.""\n\nThat's how Blaise Pascal figured out that, regardless of whether there's an afterlife, it's better to live according to a set of good rules than to go around doing whatever you want.  People all around the world still follow his advice today."
"If a CT scan results show a negative can a post concussion syndrome be claimed?
A friend is being sued when a careless person towards a backing forklift and a bolt of fabric fell on him causing a laceration on his forehead. After denying back and neck pain and showing full fuction of all his limbs and the CT scan came out negative, the day of the incident, he is claiming a list of injuries that do not follow his original claim in the medical report. Such as loss of consiousness when that was denied at the scene, and sexual disfunction due to traumatic brain injuries, with a new claim of post concussion syndrome, which when looked up, IS a concussion, which, wouldn't it have been picked up by the CT scan?
Any time you have a head injury which causes the brain to ""slosh"" up against the skull, you are ""concussing"" the brain. A CT may not show anything if it is mild and no bleeding has occurred. The symptoms he is describing would seem to indicate quite a serious injury that would have been picked up on in the Emergency Department"

"Prove that the area of a circle is pi*r^2.?
I want as many approaches to this proof. I know of at least 2 approaches.
One way to reason is this.  Let n be any even integer greater than or equal to 4.  Divide the circle into n equal wedges (by drawing n/2 diameter lines with angles between successive lines equal to 360/n degrees).  Now, cut the wedges out and make a ""rectangle"" with them: n/2 wedges with the points downward and the arcs on top of adjacent pairs of wedges touching each other, then the other n/2 wedges with the points upward and adjacent arcs touching, filling the spaces of the first n/2 wedges.  What you end up with is almost a rectangle with top and bottom each made of n/2 360/n-degree arcs, and the lateral sides slanting slightly, made from the long edges of the wedges on each end.\n\nYou can estimate the area of this figure (which is the same as the area of the original circle of radius r) by pretending it IS a rectangle.  The length is the circumference of the circle, or 2*pi*r/2 (since half the circumference is the top, half is the bottom) (by definition of pi).  The width is the length of a wedge, or r.  So the area is about pi*r^2.  \n\nTo turn the estimate into an exact value, consider what happens as n goes to infinity, that is, it increases without bound.\n\nAs n goes to infinity, the slanted edges aproach being verticle and the number of arcs making up the top and bottom approaches infinity, and the arcs themselves approach straight horizontal lines.  Thus, the figure approaches a rectangle of exactly area pi*r^2.  However, for each n, you have the same circle of the same area, so the area of that circle is pi*r^2."

"What is the heaviest object in the universe?

The heaviest (technically, the most massive) things in the universe are black holes.  Since nothing can get out of a black hole, whatever they suck in, stays in.  Most galaxies have black holes at the center, and since the center of galaxies can be a pretty crowded place, a lot of stars can get sucked into these black holes.  \n\nThe largest known black hole inhabits the core of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. The M87 black hole appears to be about three billion times the mass of the Sun, with a diameter of about 11 billion miles (18 billion km) - almost twice the diameter of the orbit of Pluto, the most-distant planet in our solar system.  That's big!\n\nDoesn't it seem weird that we can weigh something trillions of miles away from us?  The way scientists weigh distant stars, galaxies, and black holes is to look at the motion of things near them.  Gravity makes things move - fall and orbit - and by looking at how things move near a galaxy or black hole, scientists can get a pretty good idea how strong its gravity is.  And that tells them how massive it is - tricky, eh?"
"Who think Haitians are Americans and why?

This is what happens when we start using slang and abbreviations.\n\nThe word American should be used as the words Asian, African or European, referring to the geographic area not the country. However in the real world it has become the abbreviation for citizens of the 'United States of America'.\n\nYou will very seldom hear some one say, ""He is North American"". They will say either Canadian, American or Mexican.\n\nThere are three Americas: North America, Central America and South America.\n\nTo confuse thing more if a person uses the term ""Latin American"" they can be from North, Central or South America.\n\nAs to Haitians, being American... that would depend on the politics of the day.  Since the Caribbean Islands are between North and South American the could be considered to be part of the Americas. However since the word ""American"" refers to someone from the U.S. you will never hear a person living in Haiti call themselves an American.\n\nNow to muddy the waters a bit more... Many Haitians do migrate to the U.S., once here many do become American... by their choice."

"I want to know about the GUFF, it's a Catholic hall of Souls and I can't find info Please help?

In the Sefer Zohar, a major book of Jewish mysticism written in the middle ages in medieval aramaic, there is a whole section on The Guf, it is loosely translated to mean ""hall of souls"". The Guf and all the souls in it were created at the beginning of time, the same time that God created Adam and Eve. No new souls have ever been created, all souls are as old as the universe. When a child is conceived its soul comes from the Guf, where it has been ""waiting"" for a body.\n\nFor reason that are unclear, a soul can sometimes return to the Guf after a person dies. The Zohar also says that when all the souls in the Guf have been sent out and the Guf is empty, it will be the end of days.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nThe guf\n\nIn Judeo-Christian mythology, the Guf is the Hall of Souls. Every time an infant is born, this is where its soul comes from. Folklore says sparrows can see the soul's descent and this explains their song. But a day will come when the sparrow sings no more, because there are only a finite number of souls in The Guf. It's when the last soul is used, and The Guf is empty, that the world will end. The first infant born without a soul, born dead as a soulless child must be, heralds the death of the world, and so is called The Final Sign.\n\nThe Guf is sometimes described as a columbarium, or bird-house."

"List the factors that influence diffusion rates across the call membrane?

Given that a certain type of molecule is small enough to permeate through the cell membrane, the most important factor influencing the rate of diffusion is the concentration gradient.  This is simply the difference in concentration levels of the substance between the outside and the inside of the cell.  The larger the difference in concentrations, the greater the rate of diffusion."
"What are the names of all the blood types and how are blood types determined?

Blood types are determined by the type of antigens (protein coating) that you have on the surface of your red blood cells.  \n\nFor the ABO group: \nType A - which has type A antigens\nType B - has type B antigens\nType AB - has both A and B antigens\nType O - has neither A or B \n\nFor the Rh group:\nPositive blood - has the Rh antigen present\nNegative blood - has no Rh antigen\n\nTherefore, type AB+ has all three antigens whereas type O- has none.  There are many other possible combinations (A+, B-, AB-, etc.) depending on the antigens present on the red blood cells."

Cell phones, microwave ovens and Wi-Fi all use about the same frequency, 2.4GHz, I would be interested to know how deep does this signal penetrate through our body.

Cell Phones and Wi-Fi do not have much power behind them is why don't cook but if you stand right in front of a microwave communication tower emitter you will be one roasted dude.  The guy that invented the microwave oven had discovered the application while working on radar arrays for the military and a candy bar in his shirt pocket had suddenly melted while he was standing near the emitter.\n\nThe dad of a friend of mine got mad one day and decided to throw a microwave into the street.

"how can you stop unwanted thoughts?
how can u stop unwanted thoughts and how can you get over something some one said with out being parinoad....how can u stop fituge
I really want to help you with this question, but I don't think I have quite enough information.  Reoccurring thoughts leads me to believe there is at least a shadow symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder.  If I knew more about the situation I beleive I could help you better, but your problem is most likely from anxiety and you should be careful that you don't associate the feelings you have about the thoughts with something else.  This would cause a phobia.\n\nYou can try using positive or negative reinforcement in this situation.  That is rewarding yourself for not repeating the behavior or, encouraged moreso, punishing yourself when you do.  I don't mean anything harsh, but a simple rubberband snap or something like that can help you to slowly dismantle the habbit.  You can always go see a councelor as well, or even psychiatrist... If I knew more about the situation than my suggestions could be more pinpointed.\n\nDon't give into the people saying ""tough it out"" or anything like that.  That is tough to do and some problems are difficult for people who have not experienced something similar to comprehend.  Keep a positive attitude about it.\n\nI would like to be able to help more, but I can't... If you want to get in touch with me look me up through my avatar, I opened my email, just make sure to include something  about your message on here."

"Which religion is oldest or first among all ?

Sanatan Dharma (later called Hinduism). it should be older than 10000 BCE. Many of the dhyanis (meditators) of hinduism, jainism & budhism are from this sanatana dharma lineage. Starting with Rishabdev to Mahavira & Budha. no other religion has such rich history & tradition as sanatana dharma.\n\nDates will be disputed, but one thing is sure that the journey of human conscious cannot be limited to a few thousand years as mentioned in the books of semetic religions. if tomorrow someone says its a hundred thousand years old; yes that is the truth. mankind is as old as that time or even more.\n\nif anyone read through the old epics of sanatana dharma, one might come across great sages, seers, rishis who did Tapas (penance) for thousands of years. if that is true, then a hundred thousand years is believable.\n\nindian consciousness has evolved over years ; it has been perfected over millennias by people who devoted thier life in search of truth and ultimate reality. no other religion has such a tradition. there are no prophets. so there are no prophecies or future predictions. yes, there are some certain indications where it is mentioned that there will be certain turmoil in human society. but that is not an end of the world, but will lead to change in the whole outlook, to a better place for ourselves.\n\nunlike semetic religions, which has a fixed book (called the word of god), prophets and judgement days,  sanatana dharma is not concerned with these mundane things. it is about one lives like human being with fellow beings.\n\nIn my view Sanatana dharma (one may call it Hinduism) is the oldest religion. there is no other."
"what is your opinion of commitment suicide because sometimes i feel that idea ,but i am taking depression drug

A psychosocial-psychoeducational group therapeutic intervention for recurrent suicide attempters is being developed which involves a combination of open discussion of the daily lived experience of individuals who have made repeated suicide attempts, and teaching new skills that can be used to ""stay safe"". The goal outcome of skill use, staying ""safe"", means avoiding making an attempt or engaging in behaviour that is harmful to the person. Participants in this program are taught skills which they can reasonably apply in their everyday lives, from ""basic personal rights"" to self-soothing, setting boundaries in interpersonal relationships, distraction tactics, problem solving strategies, and the idea that distress felt in the moment, no matter how unendurable, is not permanent but an experience that will pass. The goal of the program is to provide a supportive environment in which skill use is discussed each week, and successful skill use is consistently met with praise from other participants and the facilitators."

God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded.

Since there are four quadrant that make up the 360degrees. Draw the two axis x and y. Assume the top right part as quadrant 1, top left part as quadrant 2, bottom left as 3 and bottom right as 4. Now the calculation of angle starts from quadrant 1 in anticlockwise direction to make an angle of 360degrees. Now use ""ASTC"" rule i.e. assign 'A' to quadrant 1, 'S' to quadrant 2, 'T' to 3 and 'C to 4. \n\n'A' states that in this quadrant all i.e. sin, cos and tan have positive values.\n\n'S' states that in this quadrant sin have positive value and cos and tan have negative values.\n\n'T' states that in this quadrant tan have positive value and cos and sin have negative values.\n\n'C' states that in this quadrant cos have positive value and sin and tan have negative values.\n\nthat's it simple enough."

"why is slat water a better condutor than plain water?
im doind project on water and electrity and ireally need it to be  done because its due on monday which is tommorow
in order to conduct electricity, the water (or any liquid really) must have some charge carriers in it.  These charge carriers are atoms that have ionized, that is, have become charged either positvely or negatively.  plain water, like from the tap, has very few charge carriers in it, but it does have some and will conduct electricity.  Adding salt to tap water increases the amount of charge carriers because the salt ionizes.  so salted tap water is a better conductor of electricity that plain tap water.  sea water already has plenty of salt in it, so it is a good conductor also.\n\n(a little known fact is that if you have completely pure water, it will not conduct electricity very easily, if at all.   I'm not sure how available pure water is.)"

Defination of temperature compensation of capacitor
A way to make sure the capacitance doesn't change with temperature.  This can be done by selecting a suitable dialectric material to make the capacitor, as with ""NP0"" capacitors (NP0 means ""negative-positive zero,"" meaning no - or + temp. coefficient).  One could also design a circuit to compensate for capacitance changes due to temp, such as, using a thermistor and transistor to provide a voltage that varies with temperature, and applying it to a vari-cap placed in parallel with the capacitor."

Misuse on  your part? Or do you mean Fraud? If it's mis-use by you or your partner, then the answer is obvious. Try not to spend on small things, like fast food joints... try saving them only for ""emergencies"" if you still mis-use, then close that account, break it in half & trash it! If you mean credit card fraud, the best thing I personally recommend would be for you to contact the 3 major credit reporting agencies... transunion, equifax & experian. Don't go thru another company that will charge you hundreds to contact them, to be the intermediate for you.... You can do it yourself for free or way cheaper. Put  your social on ""fraud alert"" with each agency so that every time your credit report is pulled for any reason, your info is flagged as a fraud alert. They also have more agressive ways of preventing fraud. Check out their websites for more info"
"How many of us are on here not for answers persay,but to see how others emotions are affected by our questions
to analyze their responses, and to understand how humans react to different things. That's part of the study of pyschology isn't it? Try to answer the first half of my question and forget about the pyschology part.
Checking out people's emotional response, hidden or overt, is an excellent way to see where they are spiritually.  So naturally, some will exploit this to the max, in order to highlight the difference between a person's doctrine and actions."
